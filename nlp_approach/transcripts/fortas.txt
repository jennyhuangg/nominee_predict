In the heady early days of Franklin Roosevelt's administration, two young southern liberals came together In Washington and discovered- the first,-bond of -friendship. One went ont to carve out a brilliant career In politics;: the other rose-to the top of the legal profession and successfully argued two landmark cases in U.S, criminal law. Lastweek the politician of that pair, Lyndon Johnson, put the Presidential seat on the friendship of 30 years,by naming the lawyer, Abe Fortas, as his first appointee to the U.S, upreme Court..

THE REAS0N

Some Johnson watchers were surprised that acqviescence came so hard from a

man who0has always been eager to serve Mr. Johnson. But Fortas' friends ex-

plained his reluctance on that very basis; he feared that his appointment.would

smack of government-by-crony.

The Memplils-reared Fortas has unquestionably been the President's most

Influential intimate outside the White House. The son of a Jewish cabinet-

maker, Junior Bureaucrat Fortas first met Lyndon Johnson in theer.rly days of

the Roosevelt New Deal. By the end of World War II, -Fortas had risen to

pronminence as Harold Ickes' right-hand man :at Interior., Then he left the

Government to set up practice with two celebrated FDR alumni; Trustbuster

Thurman Arnold and Price Administrator Paul Porter, In 1948 Fortas won a

key cobrt ruling that paved the way for LBJ's first Senate victory and he has

been Mr. Johnson's trouble shooter ever since.

Bobby Baker? Fortas' firm defended him (until the',assassination). The

Warren Commission? Fortas set up the design. The Johnson famllyTV trust?

Ditto., And when Walter. Jellkins faltered and fell on the eve of the election,

it was lFortas who arranged for his hospitalization, went to the hospital to seek

his resignation and urged Washington newspapers Withhold news~of the

scandal.

Yet,, Fortas has had;a dlstimgpdshed career of his oWn. :A. meticulous legal

e0aftsmiha, ("4ewoul0lrework'the Lord's Prayer if it camIe'Ii a brief," sayUi one

intimate), Fortas has drawn a swiftm of, distinguished ellnts (among thM:e the

Commonwealth of Pr~eto ico, Philip Morris, Lever Bros.). :'He sits on the

boards of several riporations'an' banks Mid is a renowned specialist in corporate

cases before appellate courts and 'regulatory agencies. This'big-money practice

has earned him a Rolls-Royce and an art-laden Georgetown home, where Fortas,

a near-professional violinist, indulges a consuming passion for chamber music.

But there has been another side to success. During the McCarthy era it was

Fortas' firm that defended Owen Lattimore and other headlined securityy risks."

And as an unpaid Court-appointed attorney, Fortas argued the case for Clarence

Earl Gideon, which led to the Supreme Court's; landmark right-to-counsel rule

for penniless defendants.

Forts bas no Judicial experience. But Justlce'Wlllm 0. Douglas-- -bne of

Fortas"teachers at Yale LaW 'School--has been'his judicial meztor anl the

Inevitably, there were Republican prellictions that lita' would be little

During tht period 0f time the complexion -of Government' within

His legal talents served not only the lucrative clientele but served

those who could ill afford an attorney. .

In fact, one of his most noteworthy cases was Gideon v. Wainutigh1.

In that caselie served as a Court-appoited.counsel. for an indigent

client who because of his indigencyhad been denied the right of couh-

and established the constitutional right of a defeiident to counsel in

SI would point but that he cam6 to the Agricultural Adjustment Ad-

,ministrationin 1032, and he was their Assistant Chief.of the Marketing

-Division.:'. In th iext 10 years lie had nine.jobs'in the Federal Gov-

ernment, moving from one agency to another. And yofi may read the

record, at the -top of page 2, as.I have, given. it' and you probably

already know it4

'

Now. it, was during this period of service in the F. deral Government

that Aie'Fdrtas became' h member of)the,International -Juridical As-

mittee may not know itand perhaps the public does not know too much

about. it, nor the other Members of. Congress if they have not made

-a!specialty of studying 'un-American activities as I have doneifor

many years.

organization of lawyers, whichwas founded in.theUnited St.Wes in

succeeded to a remarkable extent in cordinating research and orga-

NOMINATION OF 'ABE FORTAS

Miss SmIgoIr. No. He was a member of the International Juridical Association, the object of which was toprotet Communists when they got.into trouble wit the laws of the United States.
Senator HRUSKA., I understand that; - Miss SimARo . That was his object,"and they. did, year after year after year, case after case after case, defending, Communists and he was in th6 tp, he was in the top policy, cnmnittee.
Senator HRUSKA. I understand tliat, -MAiss Shearon; I know ,what their objectives were. I did read some'of this material. But you refer to,,h.l& r, Fortas was doing, Now what'was he doing?
Miss S 4IIFA:o. I haven't the slightest idea.
Senator IsKA. . Yet it must hav been something bad, is that your c onclusion?
Miss.SirmaoxN, Well,.I will tell you, -Senator-Hruskay I -think you would think it was something bad if you belonged to a'eommittee with a lot of Communists on it. I think that.a great many people Would think lit was very-bad-ncommittee, mind iyou, the objectives of whichwere to ?rotect Communists when they got in,trouble ,with the laws of the United States aid, of course it wis a art of.the international conoptrAcy they'-started .from, oscow, ian they had, a branch over in Ohina,,and-itwas all around the world,!internationalj aild it was stated :by:them thatithey agreed to the principleSland purpo s that the American branch pigreed 91the prinples and purposes ofithe international branch.

& Nathan Witt. He was a: member of the AVare-Abt-Wltt Communist appa-

ratus described by.,Whittaker -Chambers and Elizabeth Bentley, .,Witt. was an

attorney on',the staff of the AgriculturalAdJustment'Administraton In 1933-34

at the time Abe Fortas.Joined the AAA. The CommunistJohn J. Abt was also

an AAA attorney .1033. He became Assistant General Counsel.of the Works

Progress Administration 4n 1935 and moved over to the Securities and Exchauger

Commission-In 1038 at the very time that Abe Fortas, aftergraduating from AAA

iii 1034, was serving as consultant In, the Securities and Exchange Commlssion.'

Now Fortas, as we have seen, moved upin the Securities and (Exchange Com-

mission to be Assistaut Director of the Public Utilities Division (1937-38), while

John J. Abt had -been brought in to prepare the case against Electric Bond and

Share Co.

Let us go Nack a little into the history of the -Harold Ware group in the Depart.

ment of Agriculture, Ware had gone to Moscow-in the early 192-'s tostudy

farming and had returned to the United States In 1925 with a gift of $25,000'from

the Communist International., Hefotund a niche for-himselfiiv the Department

of Agriculture in 1025 and startedto organize by assembling brigbty 'ung lawyers

and other professional men. Mostly lawyers.

-

Whittaker Chambers knew the Wareigroup. Wlille it was not primarily an

espionage group, but was dedicated, rather, to aiding In the dispersal, of COm-

munists throughout the Government and, In pilfering documents to be conveyed

to the U.S.S.R., still, Chambers noted thAt to his "personal. knowledge, at least

eight members of the group were sooner or later involved with a Soviet espionage

apparatus as members or helpers,'." -(Chambers, Whittaker, witness, 1052, p. 843.);

Chambers continued:

"I can Imagine no better, way to: convey the secret power of the Communist, Party in the. domestic policies of the , U.S. Government from 1938 to'1043, and

later, than to list the members of the leading committee 0f the Ware group-and'

the Posts that marked their progress through the Federal Government" (Ibid.,

pp. 343-345.)

Lawyers from Ware's AAA. reservoir in 1933 spread all through the Govern,:

ment, turning'up In the' Treasury State Department,' LAbor, Social 'Security,.

Railroad Retirement, Board, Works Progress Admini3tratioA, Office of Stratee

Services, the Air Force, and 'even In the White Holue. JohnJ. Abt found a~plac6

as chief counsel of a subcommittee .of the Senate Committee on Education and:

Labor in 1038. Charles Krivitsky. havirig left the 1933 AAA staff; joined the

Ware-Abt-Witt-Communist apparatus and also the Perlo espionage *group, and

moved on to the National Youth Administration in 1035.. From 1930 to ,1937 he.

was on the staff of the LA Follette Subcommittee-of the Senate on 0ivil Liberties

and from 1945 through 1940 he was on Senator Peoiper's! Health Subcommittee

on Education and Labor.

Lee Pressman, after, or while, serving 111 1033: as Assistant General Counsel

of AAA, became a member of th6 Ware-Abt°Witt apparatus and. was promoted to

General Counsel .of the WPA in 1935. ,He left Government In: 106 tb serve as

general couhsel'o the 010 until 194& John J. Abt became legal adviser, to the

O0-PAO in 1944. (Gaer Joseph, '"The Fih't Rbund,"1 144, p. 2'27.)'

In connection with, HaroldWa1's reservoir of attorneys in'the AAA in 1933

and the fact that In that very year, Abe Fortas, Inexperienced and fresh frdm

college, was made assistant chief of, marketing In the AAA, I suggest to, this

committee that un,'exploration, into t0e personal records off 'Mr. Fortas from

1933 to the termination of hie Federal servicein!the 1940's might prove reward.

Ing., It, Is amazing how much startling ,information sometimes shows up ,on

application forms, civil service ,ratIng sheets, and transfer applications.. The

committee might be interested If. the names given by' Mr. Fortas as references

and in who graded his work ard signed ttransfers from bne agency to another.. Mr. ,Fortas had nine Federal, jobs. In :10 years. . His employment pattern ii

similar to that of other attorneys Who' left the AAA pool to spread throughout,

the Government In the 1930's and 1040's...

Carol Weiss King, attorney, was a charter member of CNH. She was also a

law partner of Communist Joseph Brodsky who, as we have seen, was on the

national committee of the IJA along with Abe Fortas. The late Mrs. KYing was

the secretary of the IJA and was described as "its-most influential memberr"

(HUAC report,. 10c. cit., 1944, p. 807.) , She specialized in Communist cases.

You may recall that it was Mrs. King who led- Gerhardt Eisler by the hand up

the gangplank.of the 88 Batory.as he was fleeing immigration officials. To Wy

certain knowledge, Mrs. King had 87 Communist activities citations, including

membership In the National Lawyers Guild and the International Labor Defense.

.-While the total number of citations for th0 charter members ofthe Committee

for the Nation's Health, Inc, runs into the hundreds, I shall mention only one-

other member.tho Soviet-AmeriCan spy,, Agnes Smedley, Born In Missouri in

189,4,.she early traveled to lurope and Asia,. reaching China in, 1920 -where she

became an agent of the .Far Eastern Bureau of thp Central. Committee of the

Third (Communist) International, "receiving orders directly~from the central.

committee in Moscow -("Hearings on American Aspects of the Richard. Sorge-

Spy Case,"- HUAC,, 1951, pp 1218; ff. and Willoughby, Maj. Gen., Charles A.

May 8, 1950,,her ashes were sent to the Communist Chineae.led leader, General

were attended by 800 Chinese Red-notable

Which hove operitbd or are still.0pernthig;in thIVcIodntry. It was said In 1944

that "there is not a single important; Communist-front organization: which does

not have a substantial representation from the personnel of the 'Internationat

might be made about the Committee fot the Nation's Health, Inc, Along with

the eight Communists on the IJA. national Committee were six persons who later

joined the Committee for the Nation's Health, Inc.

.

My testimony must indicate to you that Mt4.Fortas has been significantly con-

netted with Communists and Communist fronts over a; considerable period of

time. ,His connections were neither 'trlvial not casual, and: Idoubt-if they were

does, Abe Fortas.

His eXtraordinary competence has made him a counsel of Presidents.

His extraordinary compassion has -made him a defender of the

dowhitrodden.

The famous andi the friendless hiave sought him out and in him they

have found the help and advice they needed.

HO has ntj feared to face the challenge of defending an unpopular

He has defended the help n

ess causn "'d written

new and marvelous chapters in American justice and jurispruidence.

His compassion, scholarship, and advocacy in the landmark case of

Gideon v. Wainwright won the fiullprotection of the law for all Ameri-

cans, regardless of their statiis, 'by insuring that the poor will be

properly represented in criminal cases.

So I say, Mr. Chairman and members of this committee, that the

character and career of Abe Fortas epitomize the best in American

life and the best in American law.

.

STATEMENT, OF CHARLES (ALIAS, NEW YORK CITY

CLAMs.r. Sir, I have a-brief statement to make and,then I Would

like to givo smany examples as I can,"but that will b determined by

your wishes, sir. I would like to mention at leastftwo. That would

take, perhaps, 15 minutes at the most.

May I begin, Senator I

The CHAIRMA. Yes. Give Us your background and state who you

are.

Mr. CATLAs. My name 'is Charles Callae. I did serve as, research

assistant to the Internal Security Subcommittee of this committee dur-

ing the Owen Lattimore hearings in 1952. My interestin those hear-

ings occurred when I was working for Life magazine: in 1950 on the

business staff. I .wad not a reporter, and I came down and attended a

meeting of the Tydings committee on the day that Louis Budenz testi-

fied to the fact thatO wen Lattimore was known to him to be a member

of the Communist Party.,

There were a number of things that occurred that day that interested

me enough so that for the foflowing 2 years I made every effot to

find out what I could about Owen Lattimore and many other Commu-

nists. My information was of value to this committeeand I was hired

to serve during that period of time

I wouldjist*like to add one other thing atthis;point. i have at,

tempted from the very'beginning to meet with Mr. Lattimore, which I

did with Mr. Fortas by telephone at that point, and attempted to find

out the answers to tle: questions that have long'plagued me and later

plagued many committees.

From that pbint ,if I may,I would like to go on-to this short state-

ment., sir, if that is sufficient., Wis that a sufficient background f6r

you, sir?

*The CHAIMAW. Yes,4Sit.':

Mr. CALLAS, I would just like toipreface this, however, by the state-

ment that Senator Dodd has made, whom I did not know. 'He was not

on the committee when-I was on it.

Senator DODD. I did not hear that.., What was that?

Mr. CALLA s. I am sorry, sir. When I was with theSenate Internal

Security Subcommittee you were not with the committee.

. -.

Senaor Dovi3. I would put it another way and say when I Was with

ityou were not with it.

,

Mr. CALLAS. That is right, sir.. You comet me.

The CRAMTMAN. What year was that?

Mr.- CALYAS. I have alWays felt very humble in front of Senators,

sir.

my knoWledge -the w6rktngs of Mr, Fortas have' upset m a:great deal, and I would like to believe all theso things. A§ a matter of fTet;

NOMINATION OF ABE FORTAS

even the other night I called Mr. Fortas and told him that I was going

to appear here and asked if I could come and see him. ,Of course, he is

busy and, as a matter of fact, I stoped'by the Supreme Court on my

way here andlooked at the seat he tight b in.,

The Senate committee assembled here today to play its constitutional

part in consenting to a Presidential nomination has an even greater

responsibility than usual for the nominee in question Mr. Abe Fortas,

has had contact with the committees of the Senate wile acthig in the

defense of a witness before those committees wh6 has been charged

with being a Communist. This, of course, is Owen Lattimore. -It is not the lawyer-client relationship which is the cause for my d6n-

cern but rather the type of defense Mr. Fortas gave his client.

The records of two Senate committees will show upon investigation

that Mr. Fortas' exceeded every decent bound of, advice to his Com-

munist-accused client by deliberately deceiving,;the ;committees in

numerous instances, for often it was what Mr. Fortas carefully

shielded from, the Senate what was important for the committees to

know so that they could do their proper job of protecting the people

of the United States from Commuist adventurers,

The CHAIRMAN. Now you are going to list the instances in

which-

Mr. CALLAS. I ertainly am, sir.

The CHAIRMAN. Yes. Go ahead.

Mr. CALLAS. I will show this committee that Mr. Fortas knowingly

set out to confuse and obscure the facts and that, in doing. so he used

Communist aids, provided Communist witnesses, and depicted them

as ex-Communists and deliberately withheld pertinent data of a Com-

munist source, and all this in order to detroy a bona fide ex-Commu-

nist who had dared to tell the Senate committee under oath that Mr.

Fortas' client was a Communist.

The tenure of a Supreme Cburt.Justie is fot life. May I urge that

the Judiciary Committee refer the matters,-of which I will speak

to the Subcommittee on Internal Security so that a full determination

of the purpose of Mr. Fortas in not aiding theSefiate in their investi-

gations can be made With all the proper ; kfeguards that that subcom-

mittee-has always offered,

When that inquiry will have been completed, there will- thenbe no

doubt as to the proper, cause of action for the Judiciary Committe6 to

take in this nomination. A fe- extra days now may save endless con-

cern for thols who, like myself are at the moment more than anxious

to see resoived .the many, questions -that Mr. Fortas should be. asked

before his appointment is confirmed.

,

I will speak extemporaneously-here, and I will try.W make'it as even

aspossible, Senator.,

I The two committees, of course, were the Tydings committee hearing

in 1950 and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hearing n

1952, at both of which hearings Owen Lattimora was owitn~s.

when it finished its investigation of Owen Lattimoro, issued a state-

NOMINATION OF ABE FORTAS

I would like to refer to that testimony. I am now quoting Mr. Abe Fortas before your subcommittee:

The character of the transcript was such that I concluded that it had a beat% Ing upon Mr. Budenz' credibility as a witness, but it was also such that I con. eluded that I did not want. to have anything to do with making it public. The reason for tlat again being that the transcript contained matters pertaining to Mr. Budcuz' private life which I found to be quite distasteful but also quite
relevant to the Issue of Mr. Budenz' credibility, that being a legal judgment.

Now, Mr. Forts later testified on a couple of pages later that the material had been handed to him by a fellow attorney friend of his named Mr. Joseph Fanelli who has also appeared s a lawyer l)efore various committees. Mr. Fanelli testified before our commit.
fee in Which I -wap also present that there was no reason that he knew that this had to' bo put in a sealed envelop, becau 'it was a public .document, and, as a-matter of fact, I went back: ioit6 the files of the New York Times and discovered that on Septembr 18,1947, on page 9, column 7, and so forth on the various days thereafter, all the material printed in the New York Times that Mr. Fortas did not 'want '.his committee to know aboit, he said ' he did not want to'have anything
to do with making it public. It had been public f6r3y ears. As an attorney I think he Owed it to the man whl6 he was trying to
defame to have doubl.6 checked this and made sure: that' it was something like this. He"was trying to destroyMr. Btidenz's credibility as a witness which as ttn attorney was a perfectly' legal and' wonderful think to do, but he used an unethical way to do it.

Mr. CALALAS. I am sorry. I am trying to brief this as much. as possi-

ble buit, Dr. Dodd-

enator DODD.; That is common practice for lawyers to draft affi-

Mr. CALJAS. Dr. Dodd did not want to give an affidavits Senator,

and it was under the pressure qf being told that she,'oud be'brou"glt, down as a witness if she did not'that this was done. This is the in)ortant element here. Dr.I)odd, of qoturse, did acquiesce to this. Of

this, there is no doubt. She is an,attorney herself, and she did acquiesce

to it.

The affidavit said what Mr.Fortas wanted to say and Aid, hope it would say; namely, that Dr. Dodd did not know Owen Ioattim0re. Bt

though she did not, even though she had given this affidavit in an attNemowp,t tnhoetretoibsen. o;record in the Tydings committee hearing thatn

any way,-whatsoever, that would have us know that the Tydings €ommittee knew that all this had been done through Mr. Fortas, But D'r. Dodd arrived in Whshington inanswer to the subpena satin her hotel room where she was joined by a mAn named Palmer Veber4 , w-% had, been identified before our subcommittee of this committee ias a Con-.. mitnist in 1953 and again in 1960, and Palmer WNelr guided her in a typewritten prepared statement which brought ,inall the points that

would be very helpful to Mr. Fort as' client.

In thisitestimony which Senator Dodd has, repidiated. again. and again in later testimony, andif I can recall again' for:.you a moment she had said in this.testimony that she didn't know of any qon~piraoy.

agree with you, but the important point here, Senator, is when Abe

Mr. 0 IS. It is ve'ry clear--he did not do this. it isvery clear he

sion to study'corp)orate reorganizatlons.ad his report Is a classic and scholarly

study of that subject. .Tbat led to.hls assignment to assist the Commission in

working out the 'complex, but 6.spntlal, reform of public utilities financing. He,

more than any othei one man,'is responsible for having, drqwn order out of the

chaotic situation which then prevailed. He left Yale in 1938 tO become Assistant

Director of the Securities and Exchange Commission division cbtrged with that

work. Thereafter he was General Counsel to the PublicWorks Administration,

then to Bituminous Coal Divison and later to Divislon'of Power of Dej Artment

of Interior. He became Unde" Secr~tary'of Intrlor'in1942.' 1 had opportunity

to observe his work during this period, since I was counsel .to the ReconstrU'tion

Finance CorporatioD, and later Assistant Secretary-'ofI State. He contributed

an element 'of balance' leeal skill, and foresightedness in notable degree to that

Department.'

He left 'that post io entkr private pf.actte-in which he.was remarkably suc-

'cessful. He is recognized is p iaipb thebest authortyV 6n antitrust.'lJ ws and

allied legislation in the country, He has twice' interrupted 'practice to' act -6

legal ladvlger to'Anme0if'del

tm- t6'the 'Vlnted4Nati6ns and has been counsel

to the government of the Commonwealth of Puert&'Rfh& * Hls successfulprvate

practice has npt kept him from continuous public service.

HVe his argued many cases before the Supreme Court of the United States and

is thoroughly conversant with Its wrk." 'e would, I believe, contribute to the

Court not ,nly great technicals10lrbut also a ¥oe of nAOderatlon and wisdom.

His bV9Ilnss,,xperience-,as dlre& i'rof Federated Department Stores and other

major enterplsiesballaits his intellectual brilliance as professor, and bis Gov-

ernment experience. Having been fellow-director, with him for reipyyears In the

SuOreAt Corp. (New York), I can bear personal Witness to his qualities of caution

as well as long foresight.

It seems to me thAir a man of Abe Fo#r60' experience and caliber Is exactly

What' the Supeme Court needs at this time. Only one other Sidpreno' Court

member--Mr. lIustice tlarln-has comparable experience In practice and In the

impact of judicial decisions on affairs a!d business as well as on government .

As I see the currnt'problem loa , 6t the Supreme Court,, appears ,t6o e that

Fortas' experince1'tl16 law.is exact 4hatthatC6oiIt mostneeds.

I write this letter as a friend of his; but should write a similar'letfbi without

DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND: Please permit me to elaborate Upon my. prior telegraii In connection with the President'a appointmqnt of Mr. Fottas to the

and temperament, bs outsta4dingt 'YdalJled.tO serye on the Supreme Court. That his philosophy 1 said to b6 ibra! rather th4being a eproach, ,ls some of his

that the essential aim'bo # ,vernmtnt is to protect and foMsWz the dignity othe

The nDAte of the ttcke tbeg piade upoh Mr' Fortas is' most disturbing. To

identify an advocate with his 2l6tet's case Is one of tbe surest ways to make It

difficult for unpopular causes to find repreentation and we must 'not forget that

freedom of, speech,- freedom of'worship, Aiid kirdedom'of the press were, all

extremely unpopular causes at,9'O ti1 .. ,.

Although Mr. Fortas has spefit all of his mature lif6W-Aiwayfrom Mdmpbds,

which Is his brthplace, I cn tell you that it is more thli pride In the hometown

boy that niakes so many of the leading lawyers of this bair enthusiastically in

I was deeply distressed becaUSe I think that if I may say so thb lttbrs re tuifortunately Phrased. I think that the letters are couched in hngiag -Whi'htends, iii' happily, to precipitate contrvery which I am sure that neither the distinguishe d Attorney General norJude Bazelon desires.
The substanti ve question that they. rae is a question of the gretest importance and thegreatestdiffiei&ty. It is a question that 1's iot yet been 9ttled by the'courts. It is a question of the extentof interrogatiOn of person. Who are arrested or evenprior t6: arrest underinvestigation for crimo.

fr =-doaftotwnt to take up too much time..

oes anyone else have any ..

Senator Soom'. Mr,Chairman.

The CHAIMAN. Senator Scott.

Senator Soom, May Icommnent on this?_

Mr. Fortas, I want,to associate myself with what Senator McClellan

has said regarding the concern about the whole crime situation nd th exchange of correspondence t and I do not ask you, obviously, to.omment on the somewhat varieidpoint of views expressed, respect both

ge"nIthleamppenen.

I know them.both.. to find myself iii agreement

with

the

Attorney

General.

What does greatly concern me is the implication of @Judge Bazelon's

letters. If that kind of thinking enters into the circuits' reasoning

and that of the Supreme Court itseems to me there will be consider-

able danger, ifI,read the right implication into his letters, because he

seems to be saying. something about compensatory eqiality- or, to

put,it another way, he seems to be saying that because crime involves

primarily the poor, therefore, the. court has the responsibility, as a

sort of equalizer and, that equality is that which is being fought for

and that person who is poor ought somehow .because he is poor to

have thrown into the balance of the judicial scales something in his

favor as'against 'the Stateor the people so as to equalize his unfortu.

nate condition.

But crimes, as tie Attorney General pointed out, is one of the awful

concomitants of poirerty, and this being;S o,the society to be protected

includes telBpoor people who surround thepoer man who is accused cof

crime, but the purpose of the laws*i- for tVb protection of society is

well as for the prtection of himself; atd, if we find creepinginto "or

doctrine a belief that because someone is disadvantaged vis-a-vis Fo-

cety gellerally or ,isa-Vis even hiu dwf neighborhood that somehow

the court has theirep6nsibility toth'etst* as one bf the weigliti and

dropping it inthe scies 6n his side and weighing the scales against society i:o6der that i 'th1s way 'a compensation car be-'given to;him

because df the factli atfib ig pobr afid having less advantages h is the more hkly to be involved in crime.'
STo my Iiind that 1s dangerous philosophy and ithfts most sorrily

against the people .IwI&it assumes to protect, those who live in the

closest:ooletyi. th the person accused of crime.

I do not know whether you feel free to comment philosophically Wh

such manner as the thp whole number of

to which the State may be entitled in the Congress.

means that'.34 States of the have less than 3,8Q0,000,

and so therefore, if Reynold v. ,S' s were pushed to a logical con-

because they do not have 3,800,000 in each. According to the 1960

of that thlgory to allow Hawaii to have the same number of Senators

Senator HART. You may wonder, Mr. Fortas, about our persistence in asking for opinions, if you are surprised. You know we are very reluctant without briefs or the benefit of both points of view to express
opinions on these things all the time. Mr. FoRTAs. I must say, Senator, that it requires considerable
restraint on my part to avoid engaging in a discussion of these ques-

MoLEAN, VA., Augu8t 6, 1965. Ion. JAMES 0. EASTLAND, Chairman,Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Waehington, D.O.
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I requested that I be called as a witness in behalf of Mr. Abe Fortas at the hearing held by tho Judiciary Committee on August 5, 1965, on Mr. Fortas' nomination for appointment as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I was present in the committee room when the hearing was called to order but did not hear my name called during the hearing. I therefore respectfully request that the following brief summary of my intended statement In behalf of Mr. Fortas be made a part of the record of that hearing.
I have known Mr. Fortas for over 25 years, having first met him when he was General Counsel of the Bituminous Coal Commission and I was Cobnsel for the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation in the Farm Credit Administration. From our drscusslons in those days of the then current legal problems I soon formed the conviction that he was a most capable lawyer, articulate, sincere, and dedi-
cated to his profession. He has a remarkable ability to reduce complex legal

58

KOMINAT)1 OF ABE FORTAS

OrOblemst to their: basic; issues, and' to consider them objectively and f6 th. rightly. lie has earned the accolade of being a "lawyer's lawyer." These con. victions of his character and legal capabilities are shared by all who know im. They have been fully confirmed by his steady rise to positions of great in. portah1ce in our Government's 'service and to eminence in the legal profession as well ae by his contributions to our jurisprudence,
In all of 'the years I have known Mr. Fortas I have never heard a question raIsWeregard1,g 1s legal ability, ethics, or intellectual honesty. As a member of the bar of the U.S. Supreme Court of nearly 8) yers standing, I know of no more fitting choice for appointment to that Couit than Mr. Fortas and I te spectfully urge conflrmatloh 'of his nomination.
Respectfully submitted. LIONEL GLENN ANDE_.ON, Counselor at Law.
