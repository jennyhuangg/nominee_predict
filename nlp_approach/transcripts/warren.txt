the second circuit:
This Court meets en bane today pursuant to a designation made weeks ago on a date that by happenstance falls within the week following the President's nomination of Judge Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States. It is fitting and proper we think to spread on the minutes of our Court in open session -thepride and honor that has been bestowed on a distinguished colleague, an excellent judge and fine craftsman of the law, an honor that extends in some measure to the Court itself.
As his colleagues on the bench, we are uniquely aware of his vigorous interest in the improvement of judicial administration, a quality -thatcan now be usefully applied to his new responsibilities as head of the Federal Judicial System. We

congratulate him individually, and we take this occasion to congratulate him en bane and to wish him many years of fruitful service in his new high office. In due course an appropriate formal resolution will be adopted. The action we take today in open session is more informal, but nonetheless wholehearted.
That was by unanimous vote by Judge Burger's colleagues. Here is a letter from the nominee:
My Dear Mr. Chairman: It has come to my attention that some communications to the Senate do'seribe me as 'a resident of Minnesota. Of course, Minnesota is my native state and all my family reside there, but I have ,been a legal resident of the 'onmomvealth of Virginia for fourteen years. I am not aware of what significance, if any, this duality of residence background would have, but I thought it desirable that I call the matter to your attention.
Senator Byrd.
STATEMENT OF HON. HARRY F. BYRD, SR., A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA
Senator Bynn. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, I am l)leased to present to the committee today a fellow Virginian. Since 1955, Judge Warren Burger has been a property owner in Virginia, a taxpayer in Virginia, and a voter in Virginia. Judge Burger, I know, wil always be proud of the great State of his birth, Minnesota, 'but we ill Virginia are proud of Judge Burger. We consider him a Virginian. His home and the 6 acres surrounding it are located in Arlington County.
In reading some of Judge Burger's opinions as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and some of his public statements, it seems to me that he not only is an able jurist but one who believes in the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government. President Nixon has asserted he believes it important to appoint to the Court at this time in the Nation's history judges who believe in a strict interpretation of the Supreme Courts -vole. Judge Burger's record suggests that he adheres to this belief.
I am grateful to the committee and to its splendid chairman Senator Eastland, for permitting me to say a few words today in behalf of a fellow Virginian. If this committee acts favorably on the pending nomination, and if the Senate subsequently consents to the nomination of Judge Burger, he will become Virginia's first Chief Justice since John Marshall. John Marshall served 34 years from 1801 to 1835. I doubt that Judge Burger will want to serve quite that long but I, for one, am delighted at his selection to be Chief Justice of the United States. I congratulate Judge Burger, and I commend President Nixon on the appointment.
And again, Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to you and to the committee for permitting me to say these few words.
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Spong.
STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM B. SPONG, JR., A U.S: SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA
Senator SPoNO. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am pleased to be here this morning to join in presenting to you Judge Warren Burger, who is before you for consideration for Chief Justice of the United States.

Judge Burger, as you know, has served for a number of years with distinction at the bar and on the bench. I shall not comment this morning upon any of his judicial decisions, but I would observe that lie showed, in my opinion, great wisdom and good judgment when he decided to move to the Commonwealth of Virginia 15 years ago. And I am very pleased to be here today to present him to you as a fellow Virginian. I know that this nomination will receive your most serious consideration today. It is a pleasure for me to join with the number of lawyers you have already recorded in hoping that this committee will give favorable consideration to this nomination and passing it on to the Senate. I congratulate Judge Burger, and I thank you again for allowing me to be here with you this morning to help present him.
Thank you. The CHAIRM3AN. Judge Burger, you have a biography before you. If it is correct, I will place it in the record.
STATEMENT OF HON. WARREN E. BURGER, TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE
OF THE UNITED STATES
Judge BURGEn. Yes, I do, Senator. I would have only one very slight. correction, and that is in the description of the law firm I was a member of beginning in 1931 upon graduation from law school. That name should be loyeson, Otis & Farcy, and the name which is on the biography is the correct name of the firm at the time I withdrew from it at the enid of 1952. Otherwise it is a correct statement.
The CxAIICrAN. With those corrections, it will be admitted into the record.
(The biography follows:)
WARREN E. BURGER
Born: September 17,1907, St. Paul, Minnesota. Education: 1925-26, 1932-33, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minn.; 1927-31, St. Paul College of Law, St. Paul, Minn. LL. B. degree, magna cure laude. Bar: 1931, Minnesota. Employment: 1931-53, Faricy, Burger, Moore & Costello, St. Paul, Minnesota, Attorney; 1953-56, Department of Justice, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division; March 29,1956--present, District of Columbia Circuit Judge. Marital Status: Married, 2 children. Office: U.S. Courthouse, Washington, D.C. 20001. Home: 3111 N. Rochester Street, Arlington, Virginia 22213. To be Chief Justice of the United States.
The CAIRAN. Judge, what was the nature of your practice when you were in it?
Judge BuRoGER. My practice covered a wide range of work, Senator, excluding the field of criminal law. I tried some criminal cases by appointment of the court or as a volunteer in the legal aid system. In Minnesota, we have had, for longer than I can remember, a public defender system, an organized public defender system in all cities of the first class, that is to say, cities over 100,000. So in St. Paul most of the work was done by that staff. But I tried a half a dozen criminal cases in those years. Otherwise, my practice was very general.
The CIIAIRMA. What do you conceive to be your duties as Chief Justice and a member of the Supreme Court?

Judge BuLlew. Well, Mr. Chairman, if I were to be confirmed by the
Senate, I would conceive my judicial duties to be essentially the same,
basically the same as they "have been as a member of the U.S. court of appeals-deciding cases.
Above and beyond that of course, the Chief Justice of the United States is assigne(l many other duties, administrative in nature. I would think he has a. 'ery large responsibility to try to see that the judicial system fnllctions niore efficiently. He should certainly be alert to trying t6 find these, improvements. He cannot do it alone of course but
through the new Judicial Center, for example, the Flederal Judicial Center, anid another very encouraging sign, tme activity of the Subcommittee on the Courts'under the chairmanship of Senator 'ydings. I would think it. was the duty of the Chief Justice to use every one of these tools to make our system work better. And I woul(l expect to devote every energy and every moment of the rest of my life to that end should I be confirmed.
The (2rIMtX. Do you think the Supreme Court has the power to amend the Constitution of the United States by judicial interpreta-
tion? Judge B'IGEI. No; clearly no. It has no power to amend the Con-
stitution. rlhe C11.IMA-x. Does the Supreme Court have the power to legislate
judicial interpretations? Judge Buwwn. I think as you put the question, clearly it has no
such power. No court has that power. The CJL\1IIMX. Now, will you as Chief Justice of the United States
take special care to preserve to the State and local governments all of the rights, responsibilities, and powers reserved to them by the Con-
stitution of the United States? Judge Bumorn. Mr. Chairman. I would answer that question and
more broadly. I took an oath something more than 13 years ago to sulp-
port, and defend the Constitution. If the Senate coifirms me, I would take the same oath again. I would expect. to follow that to the best that my ability and my comprehension would permit me to do it.
The Ch .%tiRMxA. That will be all for right now. Senator McClellan.
Senator McCLEILAx. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to make a brief comment, and ask only one or two questions.
First, I sincerely commend the President for making this nomination, and I congratulate Judge Burger on the honor that has been conferred upon him by the President and which I am confident the Senate will acquiesce in. I think it was an excellent selection..
In the past when we have had judicial confirmations before us, I have frequently undertaken to ascertain something about the philoso-
phy of the in1 ividual nominee. I have listened with interest to tie questions asked by the distinguished chairman and the answers given by Judge Burger. In many instances the nominees for the Court positions have no judicial record. They have had a professional record, of course, but our nominee today has a judicial record of the past 13 years. I was first attracted to the work of the nominee in 1962 by his famous
dissenting opinion, as I recall, in the Killough case, an I have followed his record since then and observed with gratification many of

the decisions which he has rendered and in which he has participated.
Even as late as March of this year, I was impressed with a dissenting opinion rendered by Judge Burger -inthe Fraziercase. At that time I had no intimation and never even suspected that 3 or 4 months later I would have the pleasure of this occasion and the opportunity to vote favorably on the confirmation of your nomination, which I intend to
do. I inserted that opinion in the Congressional Record and made somne comments about it. Again, it was without ever contemplating or imagining that this occasion would develop within the following 2 or 3 months.
So I am familiar with your fine work on the bench and I do not need to interrogate you at any great length about your philosophy. I
simply would ask one or two questions only. As I have interpreted your philsophy, I think it could be said that
it has been aimed at achieving a proper balance between the rights of the accused and society. I think your opinions in that rega-d have reflected appropriate judicial restraint. And I ask you simply; is that your philosophy today and is that the philosophy that ,you would expect to guide you in the performance of your duties as Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court? Judge -BuRGE Senator McClellan and Mr. Chairman, I sUp)pose
the round answer to that is that when you have been sitting on a court for 13 years, or sitting in the Senate for 13 years and voting and
acting, It would be much like it. A certain pattern will emerge which other people see. I have never though of it in terms of a pattern, very
frankly. I have decided cases as they have come before the court. I have tried to articulate what I thought were the reasons for those
holdings. When I dissented, I sometimes dissented very vigorously. I tried- to use as my pattern never to dissent more vigorously than members of the Supreme Court dissent against the majority of opinions of their colleagues. I feel no change. I am aware of no change in my basic approach. But I hope I have not stopped learning. I have undertaken to study the judicial systems, the mechanisms of judicial administration of other countries. I have continued my studying of the law, I hope, constantly, but I think I am probabl.: to be judged on what I have said and written for something over 13 years.
Senator MCCLFLLAN. That is exactly what I had in mind, and I would like to quote from one of your dissenting opinions briefly. "Our task as judge., you said, "properly exercised is a narrow one: To interpret the laws faithfully as Congress wrote them, not as we think Congress ought to have provided." I certainly agree with that philosophy and with that concept of a court's duty and responsibility. I assume you
still have that philosophy. Judge BURGER. I know of no reason to think it is any different,
Senator. Senator MCCLELLAN. You further said in that same opinion: "Under
the guise of protecting legitimate individual rights, the majority abandons the balance we are charged with maintaining between individual
rights in the protection of society." That is why I asked you the other question. I gathered from that statement that you feel there is a proper
balance that must be maintained. Judge BuRG.R. It must be. Senator MCCLELLAN. Yes, sir. I thank you very kindly.

Judge BURGER. Thank you, Senator. The CHAIRMAN. One more question. Is it your philosophy that the Constitution of the United States has a fixed, definite meaning, that it does not change but stays there until it is amended as the Constitution provides that it be amended? Judge BunGR. Well, within the confines of a limited hearing, Senator, Mr. Chairman, it might call for a lecture, which I am sure the committee does not want, to try to meet all points of that, but surely it is the duty of the judges all judges, to read the Constitution and try
to discern its meaning and apply it. I recall Justice, INr. Justice Black's unique interview on TV some
months ago in which he carried the dog-eared copy of that Constitution as he does in his pocket and in being interviewed said in substance:
"Here is what the words say, and they are very plain words, and I
take them for what they are."5 I think I would subscribe to the views of Mr. Justice Black on that
occasion with respect to your question, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. Senator Ervin. Senator ERviN. I do not care to ask the nominee any questions, Mir.
Chiairmnan. I believe we are very fortunate in having one who has manifested his devotion to the Constitution and devotion to the law. Judge Burger has written a number of very fine opinions. I think he is a very sound judge and also a very fine legal craftsman. As the judge intimated himself a moment ago, I think we can judge a man's judicial
Iast on the basis of the opinions he has written. And in order that there might be something in the hearing on this point, I would like
to insert in the record at this point a statement I have prepared myself giving my appraisal of the nominee's work on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia. Also, I would like to put in the record a speech by Judge Burger
given to the Ohio Judicial Conference in Columbus, Ohio, §eiteinier 4, 1968, entitled "Rule-Making by Judicial Decision-a Critical Review." Additionally, a speech by Judge Burger given at Ripon, Wis., on May 21, 1968, anid excerpts front recent opinions of Judge Burger
which appeared in the May 30, 1969, issue of Congressional Quarterly,
and majority opinion in the case of Powell versus Mcomac;, 395 F. 2d, 577, 1968, which was written by Judge Burger, and the case of Frazierversus United states decided in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on March 14, 1969. The dissenting opinion
in this case was written by Judge Burger. Mr. Chairman, I would!like to have these items inserted in the record
and state further, as I stated, that Judge Burger is a fine legal crafts-
man, and I have no difficulty of knowing what he has decided or dissented from in his cases. He is a very lucid writer, and a very gifted writer. His opinions manifest a recognition and appreciation of the importance of the separation of powers of government as delineated
by the Constitution. The opinions Judge Burger has written in crimi-
nal cases indicate to my mind that he believes that society and the
victims of crime are just as much entitled to justice as the accused.
And so I expect to support the nominee. I may have to leave before the vote is taken, but I would like to be
recorded as in favor of the nominee.

Let the

tle tisk you aiiotlier question: (Thle of tidmiistration of thle federal syste

tile most is,

filurlle of tile, U.S. courts of appeals to he able to promi'tl (lis1pose

of civil appeals amid criminal appeals. Tii one0 bad~ eXample3, the1lim11th cqircuit, thle mItethaut tilne from tile filing of tile record to final disposi-

tioli inl crimnal eases is 14.8 mnonthis; in civil cases it, is 1.3.9 m1oniths. Another area, of great coflCe' is the fact thitt sitea 1969, the number

of cases being held by U.S. courts of appeals for more that 3 imoniths

after the argument, has been completed has been increased by more

than 500 percent. On June 30, 1959 there were only 40 cases' in the

U.S. courts of appeals that were held for more than .3months after

the appellate argument. On June 30, 1968, there were 256 such eases.
My question to you is, Do you feel that we need the serious tyle of

,examnation of our present system or )rocedures in appellate courts

such as proposed by Judge Lumbard of the secol circuit or Judge

Bryan of the fourth circuit, that is, a reexamination of our utilization

of lprinted briefs and records, and indeed fulldress opinions with an

idea to really tightening up alpellate operations and to innovate in

order to redieo the appalling backlog?

Judge IIIr(Im,. I agree wil your analysis, Senator Tydings. Every circuit in this country has got to miaket iicareful reexaninatioi of if-s

techniques and mechtnisins. It must look at.some areas where extensive

opiTnhioant sisaroenreeaarlleya.

not necessary. Sometimes we

judges

have

a

tendency

to

want

to

write a lot of views which may not.,vrca iy3be essential to the case. This

is true of all judges, myself included.

The American Bar 1;'oundatioli under a committee which stdied Ihis

problem for i)me time has come ti) with some very, very significant

analyses. They were not new to a. great Imay lpeoplebut they were lnew

to some. I think studies of that kind have -gotto be encouraged, that

judges must reach out for them and be willing to accept. them even if

the studies do not. come from judges. I thinking the list 2 yeirs )III*-

ticularly there is a much more hospitable attitude on the )art of judges

of the courts of tippeals and of the district courts to accel)t ideas, be-

cause they have come to the point, where they are simply overwheled

with work and they kniow that something else has got, to be doiie, amd

the answer is just .octr.eating morejudes all the time.

Senator TYDINwS. No, unfortunatey the facts show that the creation

of new judgeships, has hardly done more than keep the courts abreast

of the caseload whi(h the precedig mber of judges were handling.

I gathered from your remarks, ludge Burger, that you feel that the

Federal Judicial Center will be an extremely helpful tool to the Ju-

dicial Conference and to you as the Chief Administrator of the federal

system.

Judge Blumui,-, I think it will be a extremely valuable asset and I

hope it will engage the support of the Members of the House and the

Senate. I frankly was somewhat skeptical of it when it was created. It

had it very small budget, as you know, and a very small stalf. Mr. Jus-

tice Clarl taking it over after his retirement fro m active duty on the

Supreme Court has done t perfectly amazing job in a short time in

stimulating judges all over tie country to do things for themselves.

And I reafly would like to pay tribute to his leadership today.

Senator TYDINGS. Both Senator McClellan and Senator H-Iruska,

were very instrumental in getting the Federal Judicial Center author-

ized by the Congress and getting it funded, and I am dehighted to

hear it is working as well as you say.,

Judge ButliOt. I think it is one of the most imlporta-nt single ste )

that has been taken to improve the administration of justice in th1

federal system in my thimeonlthe bench.

Senator Tpiwos. Judge Burger, for the past three and a half years

the Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery has ben

studying the problenl raised by the very few and far betweAn cases of
i lhvsically 'disal)ed Federal judge staying on the bench when he should retire or the very rare occasion o the unfit judge. In 1968 as a result. of these hearings our subcommittee put together a judicial reforin proposal on which we are now holding hearings and on which we heldhieai-rings last year. Perhal)s the essential part of the jiidicil reform proposal would be a mechanism called a. .1udicial Commission oil lenuro anod l)isability which would be composed of i%,e Federal judges, three district. judges, and two circuit judges assigned to the C'omniission by the Chief justicee of the Supreme Court. 'Tlhe Coinmliissioin would, ill effect, act as it special muster or special committee for the Judicial Conference to investiguite any and all claims of judivuiui[l dtiOsambilllaiktey roer( iuunfitoness, iuisdt,aitsiOftnhese,cCesaslairfyo,rnfioar Sltiavtoeluslynsttaermy wreotirrkes-,
uIemit, or reim\'al to the l(diial ('on ference which woitld then have to dletermine what, action to take. And finally there would be a right of apl)leal to tile Supreme Court of the Tiited States.
Are you familiar with this proposalI
Judge Bltimrut. I al familiar with it; in a general way, Senator Tylingls; not with all the details of it.
Senator rYDINGS. DO yOU think that such a mechanism within the
judicial system itself, within the judiciary, as I described it, would interfere with the independence of the judiciar-y
Judge Btritoi. (1o not.I do not,. Senator TIY-xas. As I described ily judicial reform proposal, do you feel it would be consistent with the separation of powers doctrine of
the Constitution? Judge BrIlujll. It has never occurred to me that there is any conflict
there, Senator. You may recall an exchange of correspondence we had
a good many years ago when I wrote an article which appeared in several !journals on' this very point. At that time 111 pl)rOPOIi was that the judicial councils of eali crcuit were not. livin up to their obligation to deal with this problem, and discussing, among other things, the natural indisposition of judges to want to pass on these delicate matters. Nevertheless, tie Congress in, I think, section 881 of title 18 put that duty on the judicial councils years ago. If they performed it, we would not even need the machinery we are talking about. But if they do not perform it under that machinery, then some other machinery is essential.
Senator rTmxas. There are several other proposalsa in the Judicial Reformn Act which I1think it would be helpful to receive your views.
One pr1op~osal is -nandatory retirement ait the age of 70, or, that ism, andtory senior judge status at the age of 70. What is your reaction to that as a judicial reform? ,Judge tiitnii. There again I could refer you to the article which we exchiaiged correspondence about where i suggested that an age limit of 70 for trial judges would be a reasonable one, possibly a hi lIr age for apl)ellate judges. I hope that was not because I was an appellate judge. I hoaeit. was only because I think the strain, time emotional and
physical strain of day-to-day presiding over a trial court requires a great deal more than sitting oii ana appellate court. And I would never exclude, however the availability of these judges for service as senior judges, because tlere are many of them, I recall particularly Judge

Soper of the fourth circuit who performed magnificiently into his nineties, and as well as he did at 80 -and70. So there are excel;tions, aind those exceptional men should be used.
Senator TYDINGS. That is the greatness of our senior judge system. Judge BURGER. Yes. Senator TYDINOs. Of course, if we did not have the availability of the senior judges' talent, we would indeed be in sorry straits. Judge BURGER. Yes we would. Senator TYDiNGS. iudge Burger, do you feel that a judge should assume the role of chief judre of a circuit court or chief judge of a district court after he passes tie age of 65? One of the proposals in the judicial reform bill would prohibit the assuml)tion of that role as chief judge after the age of 66. Judge BuRGwEI. Well, I do not think I an qualified really to pick a fixed age. I think there certainly is much to be said for limitations as the Congress created the limitation about 10 years ago at age 70. At that time I think some of the proposals were to make it 65, and the compromise was made on 70. I do not have a firm view on it. I really cannot go beyond that., Senator Tydings.
Senator TY-DiNGS. Do you have any position you would like to take with regard to the proposals now pending before the Judiciary Committee with regard to financial disclosure of Federal Judges?
Let me be alittle bit more specific. Do you feel thlat Federal judges should disclose publicly as, say, the Meinbers of the Senate (lo, all honorariums of $300 or more received by them each year from a single
source? Judge BURER. I see no objection to that at all, Senator. Senator TYDiNGs. Do you feel that a Federal judge should disclose
as the Senate does, the name and address of each business or professional corporation, firm or enterprise in which lie was an officer, director, proprietor, or partner during the preceding year ?
Judge BURGEI. Well. as you know, the Judi'cial Conference of the United States has adopted a resolution which certainly indicates that the Federal judges should not be directors of profitniaking corporations, and I think that is generally observed in the Federal judiciary. As far as I know it is. I have never heard of any exceptions in recent
years. Senator TyD.-,os. Unfortunately, there is no mechanism to enforce
it at the moment.
Judge BURGER. The disclosure, the disclosure would accomplishl this, as you suggest.
Senator TiNTs. Do you have any thoughts on the filing of a coinplete financial statement such as the individual Senators file with the General Accounting Office, say, by members of the Federal bench to the Judicial Conference of the United States?
Judge BURGER. I have not thought that through. But over the years I have considered it. I see no problem with it. I see no problem with it.
Senator TYDiNos. Thank you very much, Judge Burger. Judge ButGER. Thank you, Senator. The CIrAmMAMN. Senator Byrd. Senator BYu. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Judge Burger, I, want to congratulate you on your nomination and on your confirmation by this committee, which I think will follow

shortly and on your confirmation by the Senate, which I have every good reason to believe will follow within a few days.
I am going to make some comments and observations about opinions you h-a-'e rendered and statements you have made as a judge of the 1;.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And if you desire, you may respond to any of the remarks or comments which
shall make. I have been pleased that in many of the ol)inions you have rendered and statements you have made as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit you have expressed a strong belief that our law enforcement officers must be given a chance to fairly and impartially enforce the laws without being hampered or hindered b"yInhytpsetratetecmhneinctalw'ghuiicdhelyionuessulbaimditdteodwntobtyhethSeuFbecdoemrmalitcteoeurotns. Appro-
priations for the District of Columbia when I was the then chairman, on July 19, 1967, you made certain remarks which I slall excerpt from the statement, andI then I shall ask that the entire statement be included in the record. I quote you as follows:
No one has yet denionstratod a fallacy in the ancient concept that sure and swift justice i. the mopt effective deterrent to crime, probably exc(ding the deterrent effect of Imprisonment itself. But American criminal justice at present call lay very little claim to being swift or sure or efficient. As a citizen and as a judge, I find this frustrating and discouraging and I fear that it is seriously undermining the functioning of the system and impairing the deterrent impact of convictions and the possibilities for rehabilitating the offenders. A system which encourages and even rewards long drawn 'out conflict with society is not useful. From my own study and observation of criminal justice in other societies, I know that inany of them are experiencing new and difficult problems, but I
know of none whicl has reacted to problem's as we have in the sense of casting virtually all of the choices in favor of one side of the conflict-the accused. Certainly no other society using the Common Law System of Justice has found it necessary to go to the lengths we have gone in the past thirty years but more markedly in the past few years. In England and other Common Law countries, the people are just as free as we are and individual rights are as zealously protested, without making the criminal process so complex and difficult as ours that a great many gulty people slip through the net. And when we look at the fact that Washington. 1).C. with fewer than one million people has many more criminal killings each year than all of Eungland with over forty million, we are bound to wonder if there is some connection between the rules and the results. A system of justice which does not protect the law-abiding has failed In the basic reason for being and we are very close to falling.
The overwhelming majority of people are decent and lawablding and we mu.s ask-and judges among others must ultimately answer--of what value is a system of criminal justice which assures us the most absolute protection from the excesses and errors of the police but renders us more vulnerable to the attacks of those whom the police are charged with restraining. I suspect that most people would rather have more protection from the criminal element and a little less protection from police errors. We in the judiciary have the burden, I must admit, of demonstrating that each new rule of law has a valid purpose, that it has social utility for that is what law in a civilized society is all about. If it does not serve
the basic purpose of all government-the protection of the society-we must carry the burden of showing some extraordinary and overriding-and legitimatebenefit to the individual which cannot be achieved any other' way. In short, we need to make a searching examination of the basic purpose of a system of crim-
inal justice, and I hope the Congress will take steps to help bring this about. Surely judges will not resist a sober and responsible look at what we are doing and where it is taking us.
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the entire memorandum which was submitted by Judge Burger to me as chairman of the subcommittee at that time & inserted in the record.
30-058-69-2

'Th1e CHAIRMAN. It will be admitted. (The memorandum is as follows:)

Semator Bp'm. Judge Burger, you issued a. dissenting opinion in the case of Frazier v. United States, decided March 14, 1969. At issue in that case was the proper interpretation and application of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Mirandacase, which dealt with the admissability of confessions in criminal trials. In your dissenting opinion ill the raieriP case You expressed tie iew tlat police authorities had complied with the requirement., of the Mirwtnda decision and that the con fession of the accused should have been admitted in evidence. You made the following statement in your dissenting opinion, with which
I heartily concur:

Svlator E11vIN. Senator Byrd, I wonder if I could make a. unanilnous

consent request. LInfortunately, I have to leave.

Senator Blym). Yes.

Senator EizvIN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask unanimous consent

that ily vote.may be cast in favor of the nominee.?

T1he ChTAIR.MA. Is there objection ?

It is so ordered.

Senator En\'l. Thank you.

Senator Brun. I hope and believe, Mr. Burger, that as Chief Justice of tile United States you will continue to take a sane and sensible view of til prol)lenis of law enforcement. I believe that the people of this

country are very concerned about the terrible increase in lawlessness

and the decisions of some courts which make it difficult for the authori-

ties to maintain law and order. And I am certain that you share that

concern.

1 ani also pleased that you have stated a strong belief that one of the cief duties of a Federal judge is to exercise jualcial self-restraint. In

your dissenting opinion in the case of Kent v. UnitedStates, you made

tile following statement:

* * * the law requires us to afirm unless the District Judge is "clearly erro-

neous." Review in this court of District Court findings which rest on observa-

tions of the accused, detailed Judicial and social files, and vast amounts of testi-

mony, is not a
of others. Our

contest
review

of private opinion, or
has a narrow scope

our sociological
and we are as

leanings versus those
much subject to the

commands of statutes and rules as are all others.

I completely agree with you that it is the duty and responsibility of Federal judges to decide cases based on the Constitution of the United States and the several States and that it is not the proper function of

16
Federal judges to incorporate their personal notions of what is socially, economically, or politically desirable into judicial decisions.
And I hope and I believe that you will continue your support of these views as Chief Justice of the united States.
You have also commendably expressed a concern, which I share, that the courts must scrupulously adhere to the principle of separation of powers. You rendered a dissenting opinion in the case of Scott v. Macy. In your opinion in that case, you made the following statements:
The opinion of the court's majority reveals by its own terms that it is usurping powers of the policymaking branches of government . . . I would speculate that it can be read as meaning that the Court now takes over from the Executive 01, power to formulate "public policy" on employment of sex deviates because that "policy is in something of a state of flux. . ." It would seem to me that if adjustment is needed to changing mores that is indeed a matter of highly sensitive policy. But from whence comes our mandate to make or even suggest policy on this score or our mandate to denounce the policy of the constitutionally authorized branch?
Congress and the Executive make policies in various areas which many reason. able people consider unsound. But policy is not the business of judges.
I sincerely hope and I believe that you will maintain your regard for the doctrine of separation of powers as Chief Justice of the United States.
The last area of your work on the court, of appeals iiponi which I would like to comment is the issue of to what,extent the Federal courts should supervise the operations of the public school systems of this Nation. I was gratified to note that you dissented from the iudgment of the court of appeals in the cases of Smuelk v. Jlobson and Jansenv . Hob.von, decided jointly on January 21, 1969. The majority of the court, approved the actions taken by'Judge Skelley Wright. actinlg as judge of the district court, in ordering the, authorities of the1public school systems of the District of Columbia to make drastic, and farreaching changes in the operation of the schools under their jurisdiction, many of which changes I felt, as chairman of the Approlriations Su!bcommiittee on the District of Columbia, could not possil)ly be carried out without injury to the public system and to the children enrolled therein.
You joined in the dissenting opinion of Judge Danaher and also issued a separate dissenting opinion. You noted the dangers inherent in a Federal court undertaking to supervise the operations of a school system, and you made the following statements in your dissenting opinion:
We, [meaning yourself and Circuit Judge Tamm,] Join In Judge Danaher's opinion and his view that sound principles of judicial restraint command that the mandate be vacated assuming, arguendo, that a subject so complex and elusive, and so far beyond the competence of judges, would have warranted judicial action In the first In'sftance.
Several commentators have expressed views which undergird what Judge Danaher has said as to the need for caution and restraint by judges when they are asked to enter areas so far beyond judicial competence as the subject of how to a run a public school system. We have little difficulty taking judicial notice of the reality that most of it not all of the problems dealt with In the District Court findings and opinion are, and have long been, much debated among school administrators and educators. There is little agreement on these matters, and events often lead experts to conclude that views once held have lost their validity. The commentary from various sources, including law reviews, tends to supply strong support for Judge Danaher's very sound view on the need for judicial restraint.

Ju(ldge Birer, as you probably know, a great many school districts have undertaken to implement the decision of tle Supreme Court in the case of Brown v. Board of Educationby adopting a freedom-ofchoice plan, of desegregatio,. "Under this plan, a child or his parents chooses which school within the school district he will attend, without regard to race or color. So loi ,,"as this choice is made freely and without, coercioii I believe it is a'l)erfectly legitimate and constitutional met hod off achieving desegregation in the schools.
Some persons have 'taetked the freedom-of-choice plan because it does not always result in an artificial racial balance. I do not 'believe that the U.S. Constitution requires racial balance. I sincerely hope that, if the issue of the validity of freedom-of-choice comes before the Supreme Court, while you are Chief Justice, you will apply the standards emunciated by you in the Htobson cases in determining whether local school boards have the right to operate their schools on such a
basis in good-faith manner. I commend the President of the United States on nominating a man
who has had long previous service on the bench. Too often in recent Vears, nomi nations have been made to the Supreme Court of the United States of men who have had no previous judicial experience. And this
is not. to say that previous judicial exl)erieice is a necessary prerequisite to outstanding and great service on that Court.
As a matter of fact, there have been members of the Supreme Court of 'the United States who have been great judges and who did not have
previous judicial experience prior to their nomination to that body. Nevertheless, it,has become the rule rather than the exception in recent years to appoint individuals to that august, body who have not had previous judicial experience, and in this case I am encouraged by the long experience that you have had and the great service you 'have
rendered as a. judge. I congratulate you, Judge Burger, and I shall support, with pleasure
and pride your nomination to the exalted Office of Chief Justice of the
United States. The CHAIRMAN. Senator D irksen. Senator DTKSEN. Judge Burger, some years ago there was a series
of cases: one in Alabama, Reyiol.s v. Sihms; one from Tennessee,
Baker-v. Ca r--can you hear me, Judge? Judge B13[RGER. It is not working very well, Senator Dirksen. Senator DirKSEN. I thought I was talking loud enough. And one out
of Colorado, Lucas v. Colorado. These are cases that involve the socalled one-man, one-vote issue. The High Court finally uttered its decisions, and it was popularized as one man, one vote.
Now, to me it has been amazing that the American press has done disservice to the people of this country by misadvisig them as to what the issue really was. I would be the last man in the world to quarrel -with the principle of the one-man, one-vote rule if that is what a State wants. But I want
it done by the State legislature. I want them to determine what their legislative structure should be.
That was not the case here. The Court had to intrude itself. It is what Justice Frankfurter referred to as intruding in "this legislative thicket." And that is exactly it.. Now, you partially answered this in your response to the distinguished chairman of this committee, but I

am anxious about your views where it involves moving into the field of legislation and whether that is one of the functions of the Court.
Judge BURGER. Senator Dirksen, I think I would do well to stand on my prior answer, that the Constitution is there. It is the function of judges to try to understand it and try to apply it as they read it. And I have always tried to do it. I hope I will always try to do it in the future wherever I may sit.
Senator DInKsEN. Something of the same issue has arisen in connection with a recent decision of the High Court in the two cases out of Missouri and New York on congressional redistricting. The language of the Court was that these districts had to be precise. In one case there was a 5 percent variation, I suppose from the median or the norm., and in the other case there was a variation of 3 percent. Even the Census Bureau admits that in taking the census, because of the mobility of our people, that the census is not exactly accurate and it cannot be. In some States, you have Military Establishments, and you have soldiers that may be there for a longer or a shorter period of time. They may take up residence in that State and be there long enough so they can be voters. On the other hand, they will be voters elsewhere.
But under this doctrine if it has to be a precise ascertainment of the parity of these congressional districts, where does it leave the States and where does it leave the legislatures? If they cannot take into account whatever the conditions are in that State, I do not see how you can comply with that kind of a decision of the Court.
So this is a practical matter, and it is in the legislative field. And I am wondering why the Court has to intrude. Of course, I can think of areas where you may have a glaring abuse, but that was not the case here at all.
You may or may not want to comment on it, and if you do not, it is quite all right, 'but I think I ought to raise the question for the record.
Judge BuuoRr. I should certainly observe the 'proprieties by not the undertaking to comment on anything which might come either 'before the court on which I now sit or on any other court on which I may sit. Those cases dealt with problems which fortunately for our peace of mind our court has not had to deal with. The other circuits have 'had those matters coming up through their channels. I think I must limit any comment in that way, Senator Dirksen.
Senator DIRKSE-T. Of course, Judge, as the lawyers say, it is res
ajudicata, it is done, and that is about it. But I have one other question. In the Sten v. Oshin8ky case which came out of New York, the chil-
dren in one of the school districts were reciting a prayer. I think it was
a simple prayer, as I recall, "God is great, God is good, and we thank Him for this food."
Well the superintendent of schools sent an order down. or the principal, that this had to stop; and the parents of those children, and they included gentile, and Jew, and Catholic and Protestant, went to the
district court in New York to find out wbat their rights were, and the
district court sustained the parents. The case went up on appeal to the U.S. circuit court, and the circuit court reversed the district court. In other words, they put a stop to it.
The parents through their attorneys, as I recall, then filed the usual writ of certiorari in order to get their case into the Supreme Court.
And the Court refused to writ of certiorari.

Do you want to render an offhand opinion as to whether or not

[laughter] as to whether or not by refusing certiorari, that prayer in

public schools under the Constitution as interpreted by the High

Tribunal cannot be done?

I might warn you, Judge, we are working on it, and we are working

hard. And it is am alive. And

going to I expect

be on this to be alive

Senate in my

floor, God willing, while I present state of health. It

won't be too long before this issue is going to be tried all over again.

I just wanted to get an answer, for this reason you find, not about this

issue as such, but about the impact and the meaning of that refusal of

certiorari. Does that close it so far as the Supreme &urt is concerned?

Because you will find opinion now all over this country that that was

not the intent of the decision in Stein v. Oshinsky at all. And others

will contend on the other side.

Judge BURGER. Well, Senator Dirksen, I am going to construe your

warning to me as a kind of a warning that police give to an accused

these days, a warning to be silent.

In all seriousness, this is a matter which I would assume is going

to come before the court, the courts generally, and perhaps the Supreme

Court, and therefore it would be inappropriate for me to try to ana-

lyze the rationale of the denial of certiorari in that case. I just. assume

that this is one of the subjects which is going to be before the Court

over a period of years.

Senator DIRKSEN. It will be. I do not.believe there is going to be any

doubt about it. The fight has to go on just.like the fight,has to go on on

one man, one vote. I do not care what the Illinois Legislatire does

about one man, one vote, so long as they do it. But I do not want it done

over here in this big, white, marble "building, because that is an in-

trusion of the legislative field, and that is the reason we have a sub-

committee of this committee now that has been actively pursuing the

business of the separation of powers. It. is too bad that Judge Ervin

had to leave because he is the distinguished chairman of that com-

mittee, and he has done an extremely noble job in that field. But I

think in a number of cases, you have indicated that those are fields of

policy where the Court has no business. I applaud the viewpoint that

you have expressed in some of these dissents.

I would ask you one question, maybe just for purposes of the record,

and you do not have to answer it if you do not want to. But you know

there is a columnist who insists that you are a "witch hunter," and I

think I ought to ask it for the record, and if you want to answer it, you

can. If you do not want to answer it, you do not have to.

Judge BURGERt. Well, I think I should say no more than~~

Senator DIRIK5EX. You know who I refer to.

Judge BUROER. I think I should say no more about that, Senator

Dirksen, than the fact that the people who know me best, people who

have known me longest in my 46 years in Minnesota, are amused and

not disturbed by that suggestion.

Senator DIRKSEN. Of course, Judge, they think I am a. witch hunter,

too.

The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hruska.

Senator HRuSKA. Thank you, Mr. 1Ohairman. This is either the sixth

or seventh time that, as a member of this committee, I have participated

in hearings to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court. And I want

to say that I have never been more pleased by the man the President nominated than I am toda-.
It is understandable that any nominee to the Supreme Court will be reluctant to express himself on any matter that might come before him. That has been historically the case. However, we still must deter-
mine tie integrity, the competence, and the experience of the nominee,
Mr. Chairman. Today we fortunately have -anextensive and impressive record that
the nominee has compiled. This record was compiled as an Assistant AwtittohrsnpeeyecGheesnearnadl laencdturaess atnhaatphpeelhlaatsegijvuedng,e.haTvheesgeivednutuiess, toogpepthhoenrr-
tunity to judge the ability 'and the temperament and the training and
expeI'ience that he has ha(l. Senator DnusEN-. Mr. Chairman, I would like to intrude long
enough to ask whether you contemplate an executive session as soon as this hearing is completed?
The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir. If we have a quorum, I would like to have an executive session when this hearing is over.
Senator DIRKSEN. Thank you. Senator TI1RUSKA. Those speeches and lectures are typified by the
speech given by the nominee last September before the'Ohio Julicial Conference on the subject of judicial rulemaking. This is an area where the Supreme Court has legislative power, but it was expressly granted by the Congress.
There are few men who by training and ability and temperament are suited to serve on the Supreme Court, and there are even fewer
that have the character and the courage and leadership to serve in an outstanding fashion as Chief Justice. I concur wholeheartedly in President Nixon's decision to repose his trust in Judge Burger to be
Chief Justice. His diverse background uniquely suits him for the position. I am very, very happy that he has been nominated, and, I shall sul)port his nomination both in the executive session and on the floor of the Senate.
Judge Burger, I congratulate you on your nomination and commend you for the ability and dedication that established your qualifications for the office.
Judge BURGER. Thank you, Senator. The ChAIR1AN. Senator Thurmond. Senator TIIURMTOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Judge. Burger. I congratulate you and President Nixon upon your selection as Chief Justice of the United States. The Chief Justiceship of the United States is the second most powerful position in the world, second only to the Presidency of the United States. I strongly favor your confirmation for two reasons: First., your records indicate you are a, man of integrity and character. To me a judge should be "Mr. Integrity." Second, a perusal of your decisions on the District of
Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals indicates clearly that you believe in a strict construction of the Constitution in interpreting the law but not legislating, in strong enforcement of the law, in equal treatment for all with -favoritism to none, and in preserving the structure of government provided in our Constitution. I shall be pleased and hap py to support your confirmation.
The CHAIRMAN. Senator Cook. Senator COOK. Mr. Chairman, Judge Burger, in your opening remarks and in response to questions from the chairman you felt that

one of the prime responsibilities of your position would be to see that
the judicial system should function more efficiently. In a few words really what are your ideas for inplementing a more efficient Federal
judiciary ? Judge BuRGER. Senator Cook, I would have to trespass on your time
much too long to even start on it. I have spoken to some of it; namely, the need for judges to recognize that there are people who are not judges who can help us run the system better. Other systems of justice in tie world, other judicial systems make a great deal of use of people who are not judges to make it work. In all of England they have, as I am sure all of you know, probably not as many judges as we have in Washington, D.C. of the uper level courts. They use staffs which perform a great many of the functions which are now imposed on judges.
That is one area. There is another area which I can only barely touch on, and that is that we must, we the judges collectively must take another look at the whole area of procedure.
Now, procedure is enormously important. Procedure is what pro-
tects people. But procedure can 'be refined to the point where the machinery breaks down. You can carry so much armament that like King Phillip's Spanish Armada on the way to England, the weight made the ships nonmaneuverable and the British were able to sink those that did not sink by their own weight.
I think we may-and I am not certain on this-I think we may have
approached that point in procedure, and that our procedures need to be simplified without in the slightest bit interfering with the legitimate
protection of the rights of an accused person. There will be so many areas that I could not begin to touch on them,
and I do not mean this just in the field of criminal law. There are many areas of civil practice which need to be reexamined. One needs
only spend a couple of weeks in the courts of England or in Europe to
be able to see some of the tremendous efficiency which they have which we do not have, and I think we should borrow from it in this area, too.
Senator CooK. Judge, I really do not want to put you on the spot in saying that Congress itself has not done its job for the judiciary but
I spent a day not too long ago in New York going through the court of Customs, and I found during that visit that the Court of Customs
now has some 400,000 cases. One of the reasons for this tremendous
backlog is that they have tried diligently to get a system by which they can computerize all of these cases. As a matter of fact, when motions
are filed now it is difficult to even find the files.
Do you feel that part of your responsiblity will be to update the attitude of the judiciary in regard to its relationship with Congress, to
see to it that the modern tools are put in the hands of the judiciary so that the system may be modernized for the benefit both of the judges
and the litigants.
Judge BuRGER. I agree very definitely, Senator, and I do not mind your putting me on tMe spot on the matter of whether Congress has given the courts the proper help. When I was a boy there was a common
phrase that was in German and then in our community but in any language it means the same thing, that a carpenter is entitled to have
his tools, and he cannot work without them.
Now, the Congress is not solely at fault. I think the judges have not come to the Congress with right kind of picture and the right kind of story of what is needed and why it is needed. And I found out in my
brief experience before appropriations committees while I was Assist-

ant Attorney General 16 years ago that committees of Congress do not give you money in appropriations unless you make your case. I think the courts :have got to make their case. And I would put as a very high ,priority studies by the judges and others that would make tihe case of what tools we need that we do not now have and what we will do with them if you give them to us.
Senator ooi. In that regard, to elaborate slightly on a question that was asked by Senator Tydings in regard to the number of judges and the current caseloads, do you think it might well be necessary in the future to break up some of the Federal circuits.
Judge BRGRER. I would certainly regard that as part of the overall reexamination of the whole structure, Senator. The whole thing has to be looked at again.
Senator CooK. Now, just two final questions. The chairman asked you whether the Constitution was the Constitution and that. is what it was. And you answered certainly in the affirmative. And I might ask you this: You have dissented on many occasions because you felt that it was your right and your duty to dis-
sent. And you certainly feel that the right to dissent is an integral part of this society as long as it is done within the framework of the law, do you not?
Judge BURGER. At every level, through the courts, through the public, through students, through every citizen in this country.
Senator CooK. And you certainly do feel that interpretation of the basic doctrine of this country is essential at all times?
Judge BURGER. It must be. Someone must say what it means. Senator COOK. Thank you, sir. Let me just add one thing. As a lawyer who only started practicing in 1950, and being a freshman member of this committee, I can only say to you that I consider
it a great honor as one of my first acts as member of the Judiciary Committee to confirm the nomination of you to be the Chief Justice of the United States.
Judge BURGER. Thank you, Senator Cook. The CvrAIRMA. Senator Mathias. Senator MATUIAS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, I would like to add my personal congratulations and my personal welcome to those that have already been expressed by the chair-
man and other members of the committee. Let me say that I think in your appearance here today you ha-ve certainly been a model of judicial restraint and very properly so. I think that you have met the questions of the committee and yet reserved to yourself the very widest
measure of judicial discretion which you will need in years to come. And I think it is a first task which is well passed.
As Senator Cook said, it is very hard for those of us who sit at the end of the 'bench to fulfill the scriptural promise that the last shall be first in any subject that we might have to explore here today. I would like to revert to the area of judicial administration which my colleague
from Maryland, Senator Tydings, has raised and Senator Cook raised, in the light of a statement made in an editorial in the Washington Post
on May 23, which said that:
In terms of the administration Of the courts, Judge Burger probably has a deeper understanding and certainly has had more experience with the problems Involved than any other man ever nominated to be Ohief Justice.

This certainly is a deserved and a splendid accolade. It also is a tremendous challenge and a tremendous responsibility. I am encouraged by your answer to Senator Cook that you feel that there are areas beyond the traditional adversary proceedings which we may wish to examine, or at least if not beyond adversary proceedings, auxiliary to them. Do I understand correctly that you would explore the possi-
bilities in this area? .Judge BuicEm. *With every available implement that we know of,
the American Bar Associatioi, the Federal Bar Association, the American Law I institute, the Institute of Judicial Administration, and there are many others that I could name. And I think judges must use these tools. These organizations have done magnificent, work because they are a cross section of the legal profession, including judges. And I lnow that they stand ready to do more. And it is for the judges to ask them. And their contributions have been so generous in the past in terms of the time of lawvem that I know that they will Tbe a big factor in solving, '1101 lpin to solve, some of these problems.
Sellator MAT.\s. The 'Chief Justice of the United States, in addition to his constitutional powers, is in a position to exercise tremendous lealdershi) throughout the profession. Do you believe that not only the bench and bar but the law schools and tle related institutions can be
mobilized to assist us in this drive? Judge Bumizm. Very definitely. In the article which Senator Byrd
referred to in the Ohio'Bar Journal, I alluded to the tremendous contribution made by the law schools and the bar associations in the formulation of the "F'ederal Rules of Civil Procedure," which was one of the great, great advances in all the legal history of this country. And the same was repeated in the "Federal -Rules of Criminal Procedure." But that process has got to be used to its fullest potential. And the law schools do make a great contribution in that area.
Senator TLATHIAS. It is a great pleasure to have you here today, sir, and it will be a great pleasure to support your nomination.
.Judge, IBumioEm. Thank you, Senator. Th e CITAIR-MAN. Senator Bavhi. Senator BAYn. Mr. Chairman, I regret that I had to be at another executive committee meeting reporting out a bill and was not able to be here. I understand that Judge Burger has responded excellently to a number of questions, and I can see that little would be gained by furthering this. I just, add my compliments, sir, to those that you have already received.
Judge BuRGER. Thank you, Senator Bayh. Thank you very much. The 7C6.AUMAN. I will "ask everyone to"keep his seat until Judge Burger goes out of the room. There will be an executive meeting of the committee in this room. Judge BURGER. Mr. Chairman, may I have the record show my deep appro ciation to the past presidents of the American Bar Association, of the Federal Bar and the District Bar and my deep appreciation to the members of this committee for hearing me today. Thank you. The CIIRMAN. Yes, sir.
(Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the committee recessed to reconvene in executive session.)

I strongly endorse the nomination of Hon. Warren E. Burger to be Chief Justice

I have observed his career on the bench since its inception. It is my opinion that he is fully qualified for the office of Chief Justice and that his discharge of the duties of that high office will reflect credit upon 'the Court and will benefit the Nation.

Of course Minnesota is my native State and all my family reside there but I have been a legal resident of the Commonwealth of Virginia for 14 years.

I should like to add my own enthusiastic personal endorsement of Judge Burger's confirmation to this high position.
'It Is seldom in a lifetime that one has the privilege of adding his support to a man like Judge Burger. In the more than a decade since our paths first crossed,

I have had the privilege of working with Judge Burger principally in Bar Asso-

(ciationactivities and have come to recognize him as one of those rare Individuals

who combines a sleepp sense of fair play with a keen and abiding concern for the

rights of the inliviual. helping to solve critical

l1e has Opplied problhmns of the

a broad gauged understanding toward City and the Nation, with an untiring,

thoroughly objective, and selfless dedic nation and a unique ability to lead interested

colleagues toward a constructive goal. One Instance comes frequently and vividly to my memory: this was the day of

Oswail's assassination, when I shared with him hs deep concern at the threat to the constitutional rights of the aceusedl to a fair trial and his determnination

to find how best to balance the right of the public to be informed with fundamental

constitutional rights of the Individual. But Judge Burger is not merely a thinker and a talker-he Is a man of action. Judge Burger took Immediate steps, as the

record shows, to urge Bar As4ii:Litions and other responsible community orgalilatlolls to take the needed steps toward assuring this necessary balance, toward

defining the sensible Iliits of huh!icity outside its well -is Inside the courtroom,

'i1his, was il'erely one instainc'e of .Judze Burgr's statelntmshil in action.

The Nation will lie well served with a Imiaii su(] as Judge Burger in the critical

post of chieff Justice of the Fi'ited States. I strongly urge your Commnittee's

favorable action oil his ionllnat hio.

Senator JAMES 0. EASTLAND, New senatee Office Building, Washington, D.C.
DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND: I write in support of the nomination of Judge Warren . Burger to be Chief Justice of the United States. I have known Judge Burger since 1953 when, as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division, lie handled legislation pending before the House Judiciary Committee where I was then employed as Counsel. Over the years since then, I have met with him at many meetings of the Federal liar Association. I have attended Father-Daughter Day gatherings at Stoneridge where we had daughters attending school, and I have been privileged to be a member of the Tom Clark AwaTds Committee for the Federal Bar Association which Judge Burger has chaired for a number of years. In my relations with Judge Burger I have found him to he a man of the utmost integrity and with broad legal knowledge and experience. He qualifies most eminently, in my Judgment, to be Chief Justice of the United States. I strongly recommend favorable action on his nomination for your committee.
Sincerely, CYRIL F. BRICKFIELD, Prcident.

Washington, D.C.

DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND: I am pleased to note that President Nixon has sub-

mitted the name of Judge Warren H. Burger to your Committee and the Senate

for confirmation as Chief Justice of the United ,States.

Having actively practiced before Judge Burger and many other Federal Courts

during the past thirty years, I believe the choice of Judge Burger to be wise and

timely. Over the years, Judge Burger's opinion. and his deiieanor on the bench

have demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the law anid its fair and impartial

application to the case at hand.

As an officer and past president of the Federal Bar Association, I have worked

with the nominee on efforts to improve the practice of law and other legal activi-

ties. He has made many worthwhile contributions in this field.

On these bases I wholeheartedly urge that your Committee and the Senate

confirm the nomination of'Judge Burger as Chief Justice,

Hon. JAMES 0. EASTLAND, Chairman,JudiciaryCommittee, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
DKk& SENATOR EASTLAND: I am writing you to support the nomination of Warren E. Burger to become Chief Justice of the United States.
I have known Judge Burger since his appointment as an assistant attorney general of the Department of Justice. During this period he has proven that he is a man of integrity, ability and dedication.
During the period 1965-1960, when I was National President of the Federal Bar Association, and during the last two years as a member of the House of Delegates of the American Bar Assoe' ition. T have had many opportunities to closely observe his dedication to the pu'olic interest and to the profession of the law. I can think of no man more quallfied for confirmation to this high office.
Sincerely,
MARSHALL C. GARDNER.

Ho11. JAMES 0. EASTLAND,
Chairman,Conmittee on Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
DEAR SENATOR.: The nomination of Judge Warren E. Burger for Chief Justice of the United States would seem to me to be a very significant event in the fortunes of this country.
I have had many reasons to observe his qualities. Some of them arose when he was Assistant Attorney General. As such he appeared in the courts on a number of occasions in support of the actions of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, of which I was then Chairman. Many others have occurred during his membership on the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit, which frequently reviews decisions of the Civil Aeronautics Board. I have been a member of that Board for about ten years. Still others have pertained to his constant support of activities of the Federal Bar Association, designed to maintain and strengthen the standards and capabilities of U.S. government lawyers.
Judge Burger is an excellent and outstanding lawyer, with a fine understanding of the Federal system and of the Constitution and, equally important, of people and their behavior. He is a highly honorable man, strong, and compassionate.
In my judgment he holds promise to be a very great Chief Justice, and to make an historical contribution to the ability of this country to govern itself.
Sincerely,
WHITNEY GILLILLAND,
PastPresident,FederalBar Association.

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I write in support of the President's nomination of

Honorable Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States and request

that this letter be made a part of the record of your hearings on his nomination.

I am Past President of the Federal Bar Association, 1950-57 and 1958-59. I

also am President of the National Lawyers Club, the Federal Bar Building

Corporation and the Foundation of the Federal Bar Association, all affiliated with

the Federal Bar Association, Judge Burger, both as a Federal lawyer and as a

Federal Judge, has supported the efforts of the Federal Bar Association and its

affiliated organizations to improve the administration of Justice. For several

years, he has been a member of the Board of Directors of the Foundation of the

Federal Bar Association, a foundation chartered by the U.S. Congress to improve

Federal judicial administration. As such, he has contributed wise and construc-

tive advice in connection with the Foundation's work.

Judge Burger is a kindly, compassionate man whose understanding of people,

their strengths and weaknesses, eminently qualifies him to be Chief Justice. His

credentials as a lawyer, Judge and administrator are equally outstanding.

We are in the Federal Bar Association who have known Judge Burger over

the years believe that he merits the wholehearted and prompt approval of the

Senate for this high office.

Sincerely,

EARL W. KINTNER.

IlY DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: As a former National President of the Federal Bar Association (1952-1953), I have the honor whole-heartedly to endorse the nomination of Judge Warren Burger for the Offlice of Chief Justkc of the United States.
For over fifteen years, our numerous programs for improvement of the administration of justice, indeed for the betterment of the image of tile law as the very catalyst of order and justice, have benefited by Judge Burger's many significant contributions.
I commend his nomination for your consideration. Yours truly, W. L. ELLIS, Attorney at Law.

WASIIINGTON, D.C., June 2, 1969.
Hon. JAMES 0. EASTLAND, Chairman, Judiceary Conmmittee, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
DEAR SENATOR FJASTLAND: This is to express my personal satisfaction and gratification over the nomination of Judge Warren E. Burger to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
My feelings in this regard are probably stronger than those of the average attorney, because of my own past involvement with matters of law Involving the federal government. For some years I served the federal government as an attorney, and look back upon those years with nostalgia. My colleagues did me the honor of electing me National President of the Federal Bar Association for 1951 and 1952, and uniquely, at a time when I had just resigned from federal service, and was in private practice of law. Prior to that time, I had served as Chairman of the Committee of General Counsel, composed of the chief law officers of all federal agencies and departments, for a period of two to three years, the Committee having been formed under my Chairmanship, and having continued to date. I mention these circumstances only to demonstrate the strength of my bonds with federal service.
Judge Burger's past career and his record on the Court of Appeals have been
exemplary. I share the universal confidence that he will continue such to add lustre to his career, and maintain and perhaps enhance the public esteem for the high office to which he has been nominated, and the institution over which he will preside.
Sincerely yours, FRANK J. DELANY,
Past President,the FederalBar Association.

DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND: I desire to add to the many endorsements your committee will receive of Judge Warren E. Burger for the high office to which President Nixon has named him.
I have known Judge Burger since his appointment as Assi.stnt Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division of the Department of Justice in which I served. He was highly respected by his staff as a lawyer of great ability and for the knowledgeable interest he took in the matters of the Division,
As Chairman of the Justice Tom C. Clark Award Committee of the Federal Bar Association, it was my good fortune to secure his consent to become chairman of the selection panel of that committee. He has continued to serve as .Sach because of his Interest in improving the quality of working lawyers in government. His objectivity and fairness have been noted by the panel members who have included Deans of the law schools, foremost lawyers in the District, and frequently the current Attorney General or a Cabinet Member.
About five years ago Judge Burger delivered the Moors Lecture at American University, Washington College of Law. He discussed in detail the rights not
only of the accused, but also the rights of the community and the duties and obligations of the arresting and prosecuting officers. His lecture was impressive be(.use of its fahine gs to all concerned.

32
Each year in July, Judge Burger participates in the Institute of Judicial Adminis.tration held at the New York University Law School, the purpose of which Is to find ways and means of improving appellate process. Judge Burger Is dedicated to the uplift of the Courts and the Bar and has hinlf been a distin. guished lawyer and Judge. I feel he will, if confirmed, make a splendid Chief i1ustce.

DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND: It has been my good fortune over the past fifteen years to associate with Warren E. Burger in a variety of activities and endeavors. We have worked together in several different capacities in the American Bar Association, the Bar Association of the District of Columbia and the Federal Bar
Association. In the many years in which we have both been members of the Federal Bar
Association, of which I was president in 1961-02, 1 have had a full opportunity to

34

acquaint myself with his abilities as a lawyer and an advocate, his Judicial tem. perament and his moral integrity. On the basis of my knowledge of this man, I feel compelled to urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to recommend to the Senate that the appointment of Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United
States be confirmed. Respectfully,

DEAR SENATOR EASTL&ND: The members of the Federal Bar Association have followed with exceptional interest the selection process for a new Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court and the eventual nomination of Judge

Warren E. Burger. It is difficult to express fully the sentiments of a large and knowledgeable
membership such as ours. I would like, therefore, to present my personal views as a bar official and as a career federal lawyer who has had the privilege to be
associated with Judge Burger. Judge Burger has been a member of our Association since 1958. All of our
members render services on a purely volunteer basis in furtherance of our orga. nization's objective of enhancing and improving the federal law and achieving a better understanding of its scope, purpose and application. His membership coincided with the period in which 1 served in a variety of national offices including that of National President in 1963-1964 and Delegate to the American Bar Asso. ciation in 1965-1966. We also served as fellow Directors of The Foundation of
the Federal Bar Association. It was necessary in these posts for me to secure advice and counsel from Judge Burger on various matters which related to orga. nized bar association activities and affairs. Judge Burger was always prepared to, and did, extend his services on a voluntary basis in the highest traditions of the bar. His advice was always distinctive for objectivity, clarity, soundness and the unique quality of resolving current problems in the light of effective and long
range solutions. As a special assistant for litigation in the Defense Department, I had the
responsibility of studying and applying legal guidance and opinions, from Judge Burger, first, while he served as an Assistant Attorney General, and later as a Judge of the Court of Appeals. As a lawyer with considerable experience in federal law, I would like to express my professional respect and admiration for the intellectual integrity of his opinions, their incisive and well reasoned logic, and the breadth and understanding of their legal philosophy. It is based upon

these considerations, and a personal knowledge of his professional competence and dedication to the service of the law that I am pleased and honored to add my voice to those from other segments of the legal community who have such an
absolute confidence in his qualifications.

Sincerely yours,

CONRAD D. PHILOS, PastNationalPresident,FederalBar Association.

[)EAR SENATOR EASTLAND: I consider it a moral obligation as well as a great honor to write you in support of the confirmation of Chief Justice Designate Warren Earl Burger. I have known him since 1955 and have served with him as a member of two policy boards here at the Georgetown University Law Center. I refer to our Institute of Criminal Law and Procedure and our Institute for International and Foreign Trade Law. In my judgment, he is superbly qualified for the position of Chief Justice. He has demonstrated great balance, clarity of thought and creativity in the consideration of the many policy issues faced by our Research Institutes. Moreover, I have observed his work with the Judicial Conference, his years on the bench and his work on the A.B.A. Committee on

35
Minimum Standards for the Administration of Criminal Justice. I have discussed legal education with him many times. I find him truly innovative. His thoughts on the professional responsibility of the legal profession are a prime example.
I know I speak for my colleagues when I urge speedy confirmation. Very truly yours, PAUL R. DEAN, Dean.

DEAR SENATOR EASTLAND: While I was iu the Department of Justice from 1959 to 1961, I first met Warren Burger. Since I have been Dean of the National Law Center of the George Washington University, I have had many occasions to work with him on matters involving the organization of the Bar, Federal lawyers, and the improvement of our Judicial system and of criminal law and Justice. I am familiar with many of his judicial decisions.
I have the highest regard for his integrity, his moderation, and his mastery of the law, particularly in the areas of administrative, criminal and constitutional problems. His judicial opinions are terse, forceful and accurate, reflecting unusual powers of analysis and reasoning, as well as thorough research.
I believe that in every way he is exceptionally qualified to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He has repeatedly demonstrated his fair mindedness and his ability and shown that he is zealous to protect the rights of both society and the individual, being mindful of the powers and limitations of government and of the Federal system. For all these reasons, I strongly urge and hope that his nomination by the President to be Chief Justice will be confirmed by the Senate.
Sincerely, ROBERT KRAMER, Dean.

DEAR SENATOR EIASTLAND: I write, as a lawyer, to commend to you and your Committee the nomination by the President of the Honorable Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, which in due course will come before the Judiciary Committee.
As a member of the Trial Committee for the plaintiffs In the Texas City Disaster litigation, I had professional contact with Judge Burger, then in the Department of Justice. I have also had occasion to appear before him in cases that I have had in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit. I have found Judge Burger to be possessed of strong character, high moral prin-
ciples and personal integrity beyond question. Professionally, he clearly is able,

36

understanding and blessed with technical proficiency of the highest character.

As a Judge lie has evidenced a balanced and reasoned consideration of the issues

before him with due regard for those principles of our jurisprudence which have

brought this Country to its high estate, as those principles are tempered with jus.

tice and equity. In my opinion, he has the talents and qualities that augur for the

administration and discharge of the functions and duties of Chief Justice in ac.

cordantv with the highest traditions of that office.

This is a nomination in the Interests of the Biar and the Country generally. I

commend it to the favorable action of your Committee.

It has been my privilege to know Judge Burger for a number of years. During the past four years I have been closely associated with llim iln the important work of the American Bar Association in developing standards for the improve. mnent of the administration of justice. You and ienbers of your Committee are no doubt familiar with the draft standards already published, several of which have been approved by the House of Delegates of the American Bar Assoelatiom.
Since August of last year, Judge Burger has becn Chairman of the Criminal Justice Project of the ABA and has provided conspicuously able leadership.
The Committee will, of course, be familiar with Judge Burger's impressive record on the bench. lie has, during his service as Assistant Attorney General and U.S. Circuit Judge, become Widely known and respected by the bar of our country, Indeed, I think it can be said fairly that tht nomination of Judge Burger has been received with unique satisfaction and approval by the bench and the bar generally.
Judge Burger will be one of the great Chief Justices. With my best wishes.

'My DEAR SENA'rOit 141SiANt): It Is my understanding that your (onmmnittee will soon consider the quallifiatiolS of the Honorable Warren E. Burger for (.onifrmation as Chief Justice of the United States. It is my jud ment that Justice Warren H. Burger would make an outstanding Chief .Justice of time l'nited States.
During my terin as presIdent of the American Bar Association, 1959-1000, I became aware of time very high capabilities of Justice Burger InI relation to his legal un11d. Sluice that time I have watched is progress and have at no time found any reason to change my opinion of either his ability or lis character.
Justice Burger Is not only an able Judge but is also a most capable adnlnlstrator. In addition to this, he still recognizes his obligations as a lawyer to perform a public service.
Justice Burger has taken the time from a very busy schedule to act as Chairman of the Spwclal ConMittee of tihe American Bar Association on Minimum Standards for the Administration of Criminal J1justice. This willingness to plrtielpate inI the activities of the organized Dar as apublic service is not only appreciated by his brother lawyers, but makes a valuable contribution to the public.
My personal pride in our profession is enhanced when I see lawyers like you and Justice Burger sacrifice themselves for accepting the responsibility, In your case as a senator and in the case of Judge Burger as a judge, rather than to continue the substantial practice of this profession.
It is my sincere hope that your committee will agree with the great majority of lawyers throughout the country iln approving the appointment of Justice Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice of the United States.

DMAR SxNA'OR EASTLAND: As a former law clerk of Judge Burger (117-58) anything I have to say III his support will be heavily discounted. I know, and certainly an Insignificant addition to the enormous support which stands behind him. Nevertheless, for what it is worth, I would like .tomake the following coilnments In support of his nomination.
Judge Burger's chief quality is his ability to appreciate the position of all parties to a dispute. Even though he rules against you, he makes you feel that liehas considered your point of view, so that you say, I lost but I got a fair hearing. This is the highest quality a Judge can have.
This saie quality appears In another form when it copies to dealing with the people around hin-he is energetic and generous, and yet in the end hirin iA his resolve. These ore the qualities of a leader, and these will serve him well In his role of Chief JuRV4Ce.
If any generalizations describe the Judge's legal philosophy. I woull say the words "fair" and "practical" Are most appropriate. lie Is primarily interested inl doing Justice for the particular case hence is "fair"), but liealso gives weight to what would be the consequences of a decision, in terms of its impact on the predictability of the law and administration of the law (hence Is "practical"). In other words, lieconsiders all the factors, and not merely those of the particular case. While all Judges try to do this, of course, the weight Judge Burder gives to the non-particular factors Is perhaps more In harmony with the national sentiment.
The country, the Court. and the legal profession will be fortunate to have Judge Burger take his seat as Chief Justice.
Sincerely, CulAinEs A. HBels.
STATEMENT BY &ENATOR GORDON ALLOTT
Mr. Chairman, because I was to be with 'resident Nixon as lie delivered the commeneenint address at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, June 3d, the distinguished Senior Senator front Illinois. and ranking Minority Member of the Senate Judiciary Connnittee graciously consented to place this statlient in the hearing record.
I ani mliost pleased to unhesitatingly spul)l)rt the President's nomination of Warren Earl Burger as Chief Justhce of the United Slates Supreme Court.
I have known and respected Judge Burger for over 25 years. and I must say that I call think of no one whose Integrity, abilities and Judicial temperament are better for this high police.
As my colleagues know. I have heen a criic of the Suprene Court for many years now. The Court lits overstepped Its Constitutional bounds ol tiilniy cashuts by "legislating" rather than "Interpreting." The President. by all accounts, shares tillvsiew. Thus. lie chose a man who has the same respect for the Constitution as our Foundilg Fathers.
That. Indeed, is one of the most encouraging aspects of this appoitnitept. There Is no need to lescrilbe Judge Burger as it "cotservitive" or "liberal" or "nioderate." 'rliose tennis are%not as inllbortant Is the one useid often by the, President, iamnely "Arlc ('onst ruic'tist."
Muieh1 has also leen sa(d about Judge Burger's personal integrity. I can only add that tiithe years r have known hin he has over and over again prove(] himself to be a 11aaolf iiiinpieahalmle repaitation who will lead tie Supreme Court to a standard of ex('ellen(e thought to be forgotten in modern tines.
I know that thi' ('onumittee agrees with the President that this i. perlips Afr. Nixon's most Imnpolrtiat ppoilttment during his term of office.
It Is, therefore, with great personal pride and pleasiri that I (,onnIenld IIis nomination to the Judiciary Connittee.

STATEMENT OF SENATOR SAM J. ERVIN, JB.
Mr. Chairman. in his speech nominating Judge Warren Burger to be the next ,Chief Justice of the United States, President Nixon mentioned that the selection ,of a new Chief Justice was the most important nomination a President makes -during his term of office. I definitely agree with the importance the President places on this nomination. In fact, last year in a speech to the Senate I charaeterized the office of Chief Justice as being more powerful than that of the Presidency in its impact upon constitutional government.
Since coming to the Senate, my experience has led me to the conclusion that most nominees to the Supreme Court are men of high intelligence, character, and scholarship. Of course, these attributes are necessary ingredients for a Justice of the Court and Judge Burger certainly possesses them. However, when a Senator undertakes to discharge his duty under Article 11 to jii(le the qualifications of a nominee to the Supreme Court, his Inquiry should not be limited to the intelllgenoe. character, and scholarship of the nominee, but should extend to his judicial philosophy which Iu(ludes his willingness to subject himself to that most precious of all judicial virtues-self-restraint. In other words, no matter what other gifts
or attainments one may possess, he is not qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice unless- he is both able and willing to subject himself to the self-restraint which enables him to accept the Constitution as the rule for the government of his judicial action and makes him refrain from attempting to revise or update that instrument according to his personal views as to what Is desirable when he undertakes to interpret it.
This self-restraint is usually the product of long and laborious legal work as a practicing attorney or long and laborious judicial work as a judge of an appellate court or a trial court of general jurisdiction. It is sometimes the product of long and laborious work as a teacher of law. In the case of Judge Burger, he has had long experience participating in the administration of justice as a practicing lawyer and as an Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division at the Department of Justice. For the last thirteen years, he has been a member of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
However, while experience is necessary, a more revealing and reliable indication of a Judge's willingness to lay aside his personal notions of what a constitutional provision ought to say and to base his interpretation of its meaning solely upon its language and history Is found in the cases in which he has participated while a member of the court.
In the past, I have attempted to determine a nominee's judicial philosophy by -exploring with this Committee his past court opinions, if lie sat on the bench; his speeches; or other indicia of his judicial temperament. As with all previous nominees to the Supreme Court, I have studied Judge Burger's decisions and recent speeches. After doing these things in the past, it often became necessary for me, as a member of this Committee, to ascertain whether the nominee could reconcile his decisions with the words of the Constitution and the numerous prior .decisions of the Court placing contrary interpretations upon them. I must admit that Judge Burger's words and actions as reflected by his decisions while on the Circuit Court of Appeals pose no such problem for me today and make my task on this Committee immeasurably easier and more enjoyable than it has been in the past.
In short, from a study of his words and deeds, I believe the appointment of Warren Burger to the Supreme Court will begin a return to constitutional govern. ment in the United States as far as the Supreme Court is concerned, and I wholeheartedly support his nomination.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to have inserted into the hearing record the following items at the close of my remarks:

]tULIEMAKING BY JUDICIAL DEcIsION: A CRITICAL REVIEW

(By Judge Warren E. Burger, Washington, D.C.)*

The State of Ohio has taken a significant step forward in vesting rule-making power in its judiciary In "partnership" with the Legislature. As our society has becoine more complex it has spawned an array of new problems and that should not surprise us. History teaches us that progress always reveals new needs to be met and that is how 'Man worked his way out of the swamps and the jungles and
the forests. This complexity of our society has manifested Itself in a very marked way in
terms of improvements In law and in judicial administration. In an earlier day legislators had more time it seems, to adjust the machinery of government, Including the machinery of the courts, to meet new problems. It is clear that in the Twentieth Century legislative bodies have not found the -time to respond to all the needs which are served by judges.
You now have the initiative of Important rule-maling power, and at the threshold it may be useful to dwell for a short time on the strengths, the weaknesses and the pitfalls which can attend the exercise or failure to exercise this
power. SOME HISTORY

I will direct myself to some history which, in terms of the law, is recent-the events of the use and non-use of rule-making power in the Federal system over the past 30 years with particular emphasis on the past dozen years as it relates
to rules of criminal procedure. You know this history as you know the creed of your church, but it bears
repeating for the same reason people remind themselves of their moral guides every Sunday in church.
I believe the points I will make concerning use of rulemaking power are shared by a growing number of judges, lawyers and, I am glad to say, by an increasing number in the academic community. Too many law professors for a long time gave uncritical applause to anything and everything they could identify as an expansion of individual "rights," even when that expansion was at the expense of the rights of other human beings--the innocent citizens-presumably protected by the same Constitution. I 'see signs of a constructively critical attitude by law teachers -toward some of the judicial techniques employed in recent years to make reforms In criminal law procedure and rules of evidence.
As we look back we can see that for about the first 150 years of our history the criminal law and its procedures remained fairly simple and quite stable. For 25 to 30 years after that there wa's a considerable-ferment in criminal procedure and the rules of evidence, and in the last 10 years, more or less, we have witnessed what many scholars describe as a "revolution in criminal law." Today we have the most complicated system of criminal justice and the most difficult system to administer of any country in the world. To a large extent this is a result of Judicial decisions which in effect made drastic revisions of tile code of criminal procedure and evidence and to a substantial extent imposed these new procedures on the states.
This was indeed a revolution and some of these changes made were long overdue. All lawyers take pride, for example, in a case like Gidcon v. Wainwright, which guarantees a lawyer to every person charged with a serious offense. The holdings of the Supreme Court on right to counsel, on trial by jury instead of trial by press, and on coerced confession will always stand out as landmarks on basic rights. These were appropriate subjects for definitive constitutional holdings rather than for rulemaking procedure to which I now turn. (In fairness, it must lie said that some states had achieved these improvements long before the Supreme -Court did so.)

At) 1100 OR "lI TIlE BOOK
My central point tonight is, that as we look back, It seems clear now that the Supreme Court should have used the mechanism provided by Congress for making rules of criminal procedure rather than changing the criminal procedure and rules of evidence oi a (ase-by-ease basis.
If a large undertaking like framing rules of procedure Is performed on an ad hoe basis, we may be right omne of the tine, but If we (1o it 'Iby the book," we are likely to (1o it correctly all of the time. Surely It Is arguable that the mlsle concepts of orderly procedure must apply to the enormously complex task of rewriting a code of criminal procedure. Over these past dozen years, however. the Supreme Court has been revising the code of criminal procedure and evidence "pieemeal" on a case-by-ease basis, on inadequate records and incomplete factual data rather than by the orderly procpss of statutory rulemaking.
I suggest to you that a large measure of responsibility for soie of the bitterness In American liftto,day over the administration of criminal justice can fairly be. laid to the method which the Supreme Court elected to use for this comprelhensive-this enormous-task. My thesis assumes the correctness of the objectives the Court sought to reach in all of these controversial holdings. To put this iI simple terms, the Supreme Court helped make the problems we now have because it did not "go by the book" and use tie tested, although admittedly slow process of rulemaking through use of the Advisory Committee mechanism provided by Congress 30 years ago.
JUDGES AN) COURTS NOT "IMMUNE"
If anyone should think -it unseemly that a judge should undertake to analyze and comment on tiltac%tions of tilheighest court, let me suggest that Rio court and no judge should be immune from examination of its functioning. Moreover, the need for such study is in direct proportion to the degree of reviewability of tile particular court. A court which Is final and unrevh'wable needs more careful scrutiny than any other. Iunreviewable power Is the most likely to indulge Itself and the least likely to engage in dispassionate self-analysis. Presihents, governors and legislators, like most state judges, ('all he recalled by tiltp,eople for goo(l reasons-or none, but judges of Federal constitutional courts cannot be recalled.
Chief Justice Warren, and more recently Chief Justle-desIgnate Fortas, have reaffirmed the value of constructive criticism of the courts and of Judicial action. Of course, this Is as it should be. In a country like ours, no public institution, or the people who operate it, can be above public debate. The important thing is that public discussion of the courts he constructive, objective al cahn and not emotional or bitter or per.onal.
I question tonight. not the court or the last decade's holdings of the court but its methodology and tileloose ends, confusion anid bitterness that methodology tis left litIts wake. There Is no legitimate place in American life for some of lite acrimonilous, Irrational criticism of the Supreme Court atd it ought to 1top.
THE BASI' PIIMcTION OR JIUT1E
The basic function of judges is to decide cases and resolve controversies. In perfornilg that fund ion, a .ourt of last resort nust, a,, we all know. construe and interpret conltitutons, statutes., rules. contracts, wills and trusts and in so doing it. will frequently "make" law. This is Inherent ilnthe evolution of commolln law. But traditionally the making of codes of procedure or evidence, or ruleniaking, is essentially a legislative function and tillass, itlany noted legal seholl's have pointed out, is because courtts do not have the fact-gathering machinery or indeed the time needed for this difficult task ; it is not because of a lack of competence. No one could seriously Challenge the conletelce of lilte justices of the Supreme Court to draft a code of crininal procedure, provided they could take tiletime and have the staff facilities necessary.
Facts and Information are the raw materials of tie law whether in deciding a particular case or it framing rules of procedure: nowhere it this more crtc'ial thatliti tle development of procedures. Rarely (li olte case or event a dozen cases, anid no one text or authority nor even a dozen writers, supply all adequate factual foundation for building it structure of rules of procedure. Indeed, raw information and raw facts alone are not enough, fortall raw Riaterial Is useless, and call even he misleading, until It Isprocessed. Wo have techniques in rulemakilg for this processing whili are tried and tested. They are based o tileadversary

41
system itself, drawing on centuries of experience whi(li taught us to defer con(uitslons until we had allowed the (lMashof opposing points of view and the comnpehtition of Ideas to supply a base or predicate for acting and drafting.
N9ED FOR ORDERLY HULEMAKING
It was, as 1 suggested, more tlan 30 years ago Ihat tilt legal professlon, tile courts 11sl(d Congress recognized the need for an orderly rule-making procedure for the Federal system. Federal judges. and particularly the Supreme Court, i,.knowiedged that tile press of their own dally work a1n(1 the narrowness of tMe records of particular eases before them were obstacles to sound rulemaking.
It was also recognized that a legislative body, even with a great number of lawyers iii its membership, was not a satisfactory instrument for making detailed rules of 'vil or criminal procedure. lrom tl premise that neither the courts nor Congress could perform this function alone, a rule-making procedure was establimied by law to enable tile Supreme Court to prescribe rule, by use of an Advisory ('omnlittee appointed by tile Court. This advisory "legislative" body included lawyers. judges a nd law professors. It li Wirt was to carry oil hearings, seminars and enipirhial studies aiid then submit tite proposed rules to the Supreme Court. The Court after study was empowered to approve and adopt them. Under the statute they were then to be sent to Congress sli(, absent a modification within a stated ioriod. they would bevono the law. Thim as we know was the process by which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were born. This is what you are now about to do.
The genius of this scheie wis that it was a Joint enterprise of the Judiciary 1nd Congress and tie legal profession as a whole. While there were some critics of tile Federal Rules of Civil Procedure so produced, the method of their drafting, prepa ration tl()d adoption brought a bout overwhelming acceptance among lawyers, Judges, scholars and public. First, there was a broadly based and representative Advisory Committee selected by the Supreme Court and as an official body it had great stat ure. Seo'id, tilt' Committee consulted every organization which was entitled to be heard. Bar assoclations and law schools carried on extensive studies anl seilinars at the request of tile Advisory Committee. By tile time the rules were drafted, ihtey represented the best thinking of thousands of lawyers, Judges and scholars iln every state and local bar. This technique came to be recognized as a remarkably effective means of codifying rules of procedure and has been copied by many states. It is one of tile significant contributions of modern law. Once the Civil Rules were an accomplished fact, the Supreme Court, acting under this samei( statute, created al Advisory Conmittee for Criminal Rules. For three years this Committee of eminent and representative members of the profession, ineluding many Federal judges, conducted studies, held hearings, consulted other groups, and prepared a tentative draft of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This was then circulated to thousands of lawyers and Judges for criticism ,and comment. The Judicial Conferences of the eleven circuits and a great many bar associations held seminars to study and report their views on the proposed rules. Tile Advisory Committee then revised its tentative rules to take Into account the suggestions received and circulated a second preliminary draft and the grinding processes of study, challenge, debate and criticism were repeated. By this stage, the Department of justice, state prosecutors, defense lawyer groups and bar associations and law professors had all been given a "day in court." After being examined and approved. these rules were adopted by the Supreme Court and sent to Congress, whose acquiescence lade thein law. That was 15 years ago.
THE PAST DOZEN YEARS
The sheer volume of holdings the past dozen years in what have been essentially changes in rules of criminal procedure and evidence has placed the Supreme Court directly in the business of creating on a case-by-case basis important new criminal rules which dwarf the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in impact even if not in volume. I suspect that a dozen years ago the Supreme Court did not anticipate the scope of its "revolution" in criminal procedure, for even in retrospect the starting point is not clear.
A substantial number of lawyers, Judges and scholars believe that when the Supreme Court found itself traveling down tle road of codifying detailed rights and procedures under the Bill of Rights perhaps that was a good time to pause. Such a pause was urged, not only by tile Court's dissenters, but by responsible voices, including Judges Lumbard and Friendly of tile Second Circuit, Justice

Walter Schaefer of the Illinois Supreme Court, and Dean (now Solicitor General) Griswold, among others. I have said for five years or more what I say to you now. In such a pause the Court would have done well to ponder land and carefully whether it was time for the entire subject of criminal procedural rules to be submitted to a Supreme Court Advisory Committee so that this remarkably efficient process could be directed to a broad scale re-examination of all the problems which the Supreme Court was concerned with, including the elusive concepts and problems of eyewitness identification at police lineup procedures, to mention but one example on which judges generally have little or no first hand knowledge or experience.
A DANGEROUS, MISCHIEVOUS WEAKNESS
There is a dangerous and even mischievous weakness in making or revising sweeping general rules of procedure and evidence on a case-by-case basis. The axiom of lawyers that "hard cases make bad law," applies and by the very nature of the review jurisdiction of the Supreme Court the cases it decides to review are usually "hard" cases and not the ordinary or usual kind of case. The Court's limited time often requires that the "easy" cases be left to others. Thestate cases which come to the Court give them less choice, especially in a period of escalating constitutional concepts, but essentially the Supreme Court is its own "traffic
manager." These "hard" cases usually come to the Court on the narrow record of but one
case which frequently presents emotionally appealing situations that confuse and blur the bedrock consequences of a broad holding. With deference, I suggest that these cases are not always briefed and argued by men qualified by experience to. present a case of great magnitude and consequence. Indeed, members of the
Court have been heard to complain about the inadequacy of presentation. When the presentation for the accused is inadequate the mechanism of a brief from a friend-of-the-court is used. The Supreme Court cannot impose a friend-of-thecourt on the State as an Appellee and this is where the States have been weak.
In short, the narrow record of the particular case, the appealing aspects of' the "hard" case, and the presentation by inadequate briefs and arguments from lawyers who never before, and perhaps never again, will see the hallowed chambers of the Supreme Court, all combine to have a large issue decided without the careful, painstaking, deliberative processes of the Supreme Court's Advisory Committees which I have already described.
Justice White, dissenting in United States v. Wade, which established new rules for police lineups, said:
"The Court assumes a narrower evil as the basis for its rule-Improper police suggestion which contributes to erroneous identifications. The Court apparently believes that improper police procedures are so widespread that a broad prophylactic rule must be laid down. requiring tihe presence of counsel at all pre-trial identifications, in order to detect recurring instances of police misconduct. I do not share this pervasive distrust of all official investigations. None of the materials the Court relies upon supports it. Certainly, I would bow to solid fact. but the Court quite obviously does not have before it any reliable, comprehensive survey of current police practices on which to base its new rule. Until it does, the Court should avoid excluding relevant evidence from state criminal trials."
Justice Black was even sharper with the five majority Justices; he said in his
dissent: " * * even if this Court has power to establish such a rule of evidence, I think
the rule fashioned by the Court is unsound. The "tainted fruit" determination required by the Court involves more than considerable difficulty. I think it is
practically impossible. How is a witness capable of probing the recesses of his mind to draw a sharp line between a courtroom identification due exclusively to an earlier lineup and a courtroom identification due to memory not based on the lineup?"
The careful study processes of an Advisory Committee in rulemaking would have explored all these avenues, sifted out the facts, and worked out a recon. cili'tion and accomodation of the differing points of view. 'More than that, such a Committee would refuge to act unless it had the "solid fact" basis Justice White and three other Justices referred to instead of the individual speculation of five Justices who may never have witnessed a lineup in a police station.
It iq interesting to note that the briefs in the Miranda ea.c filed by 29 States and the National District Attorneys' Association strongly urged the Supreme Court not to resolve great issues on a narrow record of a few cases without the.

Pbrrooacdedsutured.y which characterized the developneInt of the Federal Rules of Criminal
The Supreme ('ourt brushed this off, saying: "Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rulemaking or legislation which would
abrogate thelm." All of us would agree that the Supreme Court should not let Advisory Coim-
nittees or Congress "abrogate" any part of the Constitution, but 1 respectfully point out that four members of the Court disagreed with the five and that for nearly 200 years the "constitutional rights" which emerged from some of these cases were not seen by anyone. 1 hasten to add that no Court should ever be precluded from recog izing a constitutional right previously overlooked, but the Supreme Court's historic reluctance to "reach" for constitutional issues might well have led to allowing the rule-making process to function first as it has so admirably in the past before resolving a constitutional point.
LEADERSHIP SHOULD COME FROM THE COURT
Leadership in Improving the administration of justice should, of course, come from the Supreme Court and under the statutory procedure it is not bound by what the Advisory Committee finally submits any more than It gives advance constitutional approval by adopting a set of rules. But for the life of me, I cannot see why the Supreme Court should assume this enormous task singlehanded and ignore the thousands of lawyers, judges and professors and such helpful groups as the ALI and others.
Members of the Supreme Court have been known to express regret and even annoyance from time to time at the lack of support for the Court's holdings from the legal profession and the Judiciary. But that should not be surprising when valid arguments have been responsibly advanced by four Justices in dissent urging the Court to go slowly and seek more reliable empirical data on the issue at hand and this is met by a lofty comment that on constitutional doctrine the Court "does not conduct a poll." With four Justices and a large segment of the legal profession protesting that no constitutional doctrine is involved in the particular case, the five should not expect that their arch comment about polls disposes of the matter. A possible explanation for widespread lack of support for some of the Court's holdings lies in the homely reality that the legal profession would like to be in on the takeoff-perhaps via the statutory rule-making process-if they are to be of help in explaining landing which shake up the passengers.
You will recall that in United States v. Wade, Justice Black, speaking in dissent, said somewhat acidly:
"I have never been able to subscribe to the dogma that the Due Process Clause empowers this Court to declare any law, including a rule of evidence, unconstitutionalwhich it believes is contraryto tradition,decency, fundamental justice, or any of the other wide-meaning words used by judges to claim power under the Due Process Clause. * * * I have an abidingidea that if the Framershad wanted to let judges write the Constitutionon any such day-to-day beliefs of theirs, they would have said so instead of so carefully defining their grants and prohibitions in a written constitution. With no more authority than the Due ProcessClause I am wholly unwilling to tell the state or federal courts that the United States Constitutionforbids them to allow courtroom identifteation without the prosecution's first proving that the identiflcation.does not rest in whole or in part on an illegal lineup. Should I do so, I would feet that we are deciding what the Constitution is, not from what it says. but front what we think it would have been wise for the Framers to put in it. That to nic would be 'Judicialactivism' at its worst. I would leave the States and Federal Govcninwnt free to decide their own rules of evidence. That, I believe, Is their constitutional prerogative."
Justice Black was addressing himself to the merits of what the Court was doing, whereas Tam concerned with the procedure. But If his vew has validity on the merits, surely it supports my thesis that the statutory rule-making process Is better adapted to the Court's objective than trying to embalm a detailed rule in the Constitution under the Sixth Amendment right to counsel clause and without retroactive effect.
Some people think time word "consensus" has become a "bad" word, but I for one do not. It Is only by developing a consensus that any of the great issues of the country are resolved and the matter of crime and criminal law is indeed one of the great issues. Granting for the moment the power as distinguished from the wisdom of drafting a detailed codification of rights and rules of evidence via

constitutional interpretatim, when these rules real uniformly Into every prechit station and sheriff's office in every town and hamlet in a nation of 200 intl. lion troubled and anxious people, I respectfully submit that the slower rulemaking process would be more likely to produce a consensus and that the course of sound Judicial statesnanship would have used that method. Among other things, the "sunburst" doctrine of discovery of constitutional rights which spring Into being as of mlnigllt on a stated day could have been avoided.
AN ADVANTAGE
There is.of course, another rather obvious advantage in statutory rule-inaking processes wihhi Is especially relevant hiat period when the Federal .Judiciary, and the Supretme Court particularly, is under attacks which renders a great natny people confused and uncertain. Tie advantage lies in the support which develops slowly and steadily as the rule-making process unfolds, Involving as it does not only the Adviory ('onnnittee but sulcommilttees, seminars and task forces which inchul lditendreds of lawyers, jt(lges. plroset'ctors and seholars-the entire spectrunt of tle legal professlotu and state lnd local bar association. till over the country. As the iti'ovtess is enriched by the information tl(] exlrience antd ideas whit'h these participants contribute, a massive base of support for the ultimate result builds iii). This Insures its acceptance and gives those who are affected a "lead" thne to make adjustinents in their habits and practices.
There is an even more serious flaw in constitutionalizing details of procedure and evidetnce better left to the more flexible intchinery of statutory ruleinaking. That process, while slow and cumbersome, produces more effective guidelines becanse rules can be stated more simply and precisely than a judicial opinion. Moreover. rulena king leaves open the door for change afnd adjustment to the realities of subsequent experiene, whereas altering a constitutional ruling or changing a constitutional trend calls for a sharp break with the past. The more recent the rule to be changed, the greater the blow to staility of constitutional doctrine.
Yet we mu.st reognize that the constitutional concepts "tacked on" in these dozen years or so may not be as permanent as they appear when they are consIstently arrivedat by the margin of omie vote with four Justices sharply suggesting that the cake which the Court was baking did not have all the essential ingredients for a good cake and that it hia not been in the oven long enough. To paraphrase one of the felicitous lines of lolizabcth Barrett Browning, consequences "so wrought may be unwrougltt so." Thus, the constitutional result so wrought against the protest of four, may be "unwrought" by so simple a happening as the advent of one of two new Justices. Whatever one's view of the merits of any particular ruling so cast aside, this Is a highly unsatisfactory method of improvlug crininal justice. Even those who do not admire some of these rulings do not want.to see constitutional doctrine rise and fall like governments under the Fourth Republic of France.
ANOTHER CHALLENGE TO THE COURT
Another challenge hius been made of the Supreme Court's almost undignified haste to clothe detailed rules of evidence and police station procedure In the garb of constitutional doctrine. That mechanism may seem to render the rule beyond the reach of Congressional modlfication, but it has a melaneholy tendency to depreciate the standing of constitutional doctrine even iII the eyes of those who fully approve the end result reached. Constitutional doctrine In criminal justice ought to be a steady line on the graph of history, always upward, avoiding peaks and valleys. Looking back over the past dozen years one is left to wonder what has become of the Court's firm policy never to decide a case on a constitutional ground if any other plausible ground was available.
The doctrine of judicial supremacy is firmly established in this country, hut we have never accepted a concept of judicial infallibility. Herein lies much that would suggest cogent reasons for a belief that several hundred well-trained and sophisticated legal minds functioning within the rule-amaking process free from the pressures of an appealing vase might well do a more comprehensive Job of drafting a workable set of rules than nlitte extraordinarily busy men with no wore than a shorl: time to devote to any one case, and without the fact-finding facihitieq and -t-affs of an Advisory Comiltlitee tipoitved by the Supreme Court.
Nowhere is this more in evidence than inthe cases dealing with the elusive and difficult problems of eyewitness identiflcations. The role of the lawyer Is ill-defined

and preglialit with questions of conflict of interest. The lawyer goes to the lineup In the partisan role of an advotlate but maliy be called upon to be a monitor and hence a potential witness, a role that will require hin to abandon his advocate assiginllent. If h does this, will It not Ie said that lie is soilvlwiat a "'tainted" witness bec.1lllse he begaln its a partisan advocate? O(e instance has already occurred in which the lawyer hastily called to the police station advised ills lient to lie, face down 1111drefuse to cooperate with tile police. 'Ple police th, n had tll the persons in the lineup lie in the same posture to le viewed by Ih, witnesses, :an( olle eall see tile confusion engendered by having these witnesses stepping gingerly aniong the prostrate iodit's lit the lineup. Will this become a new legal formi-the lie-down lineup! If the witnesses observe all this confulion, and see which person is causing it, as they might, which side has tainted the process of Identiliation witi prejudice?
o(E'i'INo RULES IN TME STATES
It is correct. that the rulepnaklng procedure under il(, Federal system provides no automatic means for making the rules applicable to the Stat(-. But that is by no Imealls a dlispositiv, oljection. We must remember that once it( soundness of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were seen, imUmiy States followed the leadership of the Suprellt Court and adopted comparable rules of civil procedure for the State's, ill some cases almost 21"ChInese" copy of the Federal Iules. Laying aside Justice Black's cogent arguments that procedure should be left to the States, the record shows lhat no real headershll has ever been exerted to persuade, the States to adopt more eiliglhtened and elicilent criminal rules conlarable to tie 114 Federal Rules of Crinihiml Procedures.
I have already pointed out that In adopting It rule proposed by fll Advisory ('omatittee. tile Supremlen Court does not pre.judge its constitutionality. There of course, is always at process of interpretation, but I hardly need to offer evidence that construing and applying detailed rules, earefuly worked out gives far fewer problems to trial courts, prosecutors, defense counsel and police than applying nuacves of mitany of the iewv case-made rules of plrocedulre.
Tile Supreme Court has tended to feel it. could lay down broad objectives in these sensitive areas of interrogation and identification and leave it for others to work out the details. But these are cruchil details whicl should have beei worked out In advance as four Justices so sharply pointed out amid indeed it is clear to many qualified persons that, had these problems and all their rainitlcatons been thought -through, other and different solutions might have been found acceptable to all members of the Court.
For three years, now, the American Bar Association has been engaged in what may be one of the most comprehensive and significant studies made of the adminiIstration of criminal justice in America. It Is the Project on Minimum Staindards of Criminal Justice, which has occupied a vast amount of the time of 80 lawyers, judges and law professors who make up the six Advisory Committees and the Special Comntittee which guides the whole project. Using methods somewhat like those which evolved the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and lately the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, this Committee has published nine Reports which tile House of Delegates of the American Bar Association has approved. Six or seven additional Reports will issue.
Probably no one will agree with everything il all of ,these Reports, for they cover the entire range of administration of criminal justice from arrest to ultimate conflinenent, when tlat occurs. Whether one agrees or not with all that is said, these Reports contain a riclh treasure of raw material which can help ally court or legislature in making rules or codes of crininlal procedure. Tihey will be made available to you. Material such as tills and the long experience under tile Civil and Criminal Federal Rules give the States a vast storehouse of material which has been tested. You will not need to plow hard ground to develop a sound set of rules in Ohio but can draw on all that has gone before.
CLARIFICATION IS IMPERlATIVE
The matter of clarifying the whole range of Rules of Criminal Procedure, Ineluding the new rules and procedures developed by the Supreme Court In various opinions, is imperative. It seeins clear now, with the benefit of hind sight, that wany of the problems sought to be solved by the controversial holdings of the Su-
30-05S-69... 4

preme Court on criminal procedure and evidence over the past dozen years, would have better been submitted to an Advisory Committee appointed by the Supreme Court (under Title 18, Section 3771). But that is in the past and it is more important to look ahead. It is ten years since the Mallory case, yet the guidelines of that
subject are still neither clear nor comprehensive. And the courts have not begun to come to grips with all the problems which will flow from the very recent lineup and identification holdings.
As to the Federal Rules, I submit that either by creation of a new Advisory Committee or by enlarging studies now being carried on, the whole area of criminal procedure and all the problems touched upon in the holdings on interrogation, preliminary hearings, police line-ups, eyewitness identification, for example, be committed to reexamination and re-appraisal. By this procedure we can clear the air, clarify the ground rules, and get in with Society's basic respon-
sibility of protecting an ordered liberty as well as protecting the rights of accused persons. We must do the best we can with the cases which arise under rules already laid down. On these there can, of course, be no moratorium. We should look back only as it contributes to visibility on the problems ahead.
Now as you look ahead I am sure that under the leadership of your great
Chief Justice, Kingsley Taft, you will write a bright chapter in the history of Ohio law.
[From the Congressional Record, Sept. 14, 1007]
REMARKS or HoN. WARREN E. BURGER, JUDGE, UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS, WASHINGTON, D.C., AT RIPON COLLEGE, MAY 21, 1967
A century ago plus one year, when this college was born, the country was confronted with many agonizing problems. Then as now the nation had recently experienced the great national trauma of the assassination of its President. Then
as now the nation was struggling to fulfill to the Negro minority the promises of the Declaration and the Constitution. Then as now war occupied the minds of the people and the leaders, but happily by 1866, the shooting had stopped, and they were trying to bind up the wounds.
The people who lived in that period, the people who launched this institution were hopeful, and optimistic with a characteristic Mid-western confidence in their ability to meet and solve all problems.
Today, a century later, our people are not so optimistic or so confident, but I suspect that you, the members of this class, being young and hopeful, are not apprehensive or shaken by the debris of unsolved problems or the challenge of the new ones. It is good you have this buoyancy and optimism for you will need it in the years ahead.
We could well discuss today War and Peace, Poverty and Affluence, the breakdown of the home, the declining influence of the church, the disintegration of cities, or any one of dozens of similar problems which lie on your doorstep. All of these problems and more will compete for your attention in the final third of this 20th Century.
I will limit myself to one problem, but it is one which, like war, will affect every American and hang over every home and lurk at every dark corner. It is the problem which we might call Crime and Punishment-the problem of those persons who cannot seem to adjust to an orderly life pattern of study, work, family ties, and responsible citizenship, but instead, turn to crime. Perhaps this is not a conventional Commencement subject, but these are not ordinary times and people
are not being entirely conventional these days. Society's problem with those who will not obey law has never loomed so large
in our national life as it does today. People murder others in this country at the rate of more than one for every hour of the day. There are more than 140 crimes of theft every hour; assault and violence and rape grow comparably. The murder
rate is 10,000 human lives a year, which is higher than the death rate in our current military operations in Viet Nam which inspire such emotional and violent public demonstrations. And the growth rate of crime is now far greater than the growth in our population.
Perhaps the most alarming thing is the large amount of crime committed by persons under age 20, which suggests that homes, parents, schools, churches and communities have somewhere failed. Even worse is the fact that the highest rate of repeaters-recidivists-is in this under 20 age bracket. Nearly 00% of the 20 and under are repeaters.
In 1964, for the first time in our national history, the subject of crime became an issue in a national Presidential campaign. It became an issue because a vast

number of people of this country were deeply apprehensive about the security of their homes, their children, their possessions and their personal safety on the streets, especially in large cities. This led President Johnson to create a National Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice under the Chairmanship of the Attorney General of the United States, with a score of distinguished Americans and a staff of highly qualified experts. The summary of crime statistics I have Just given you is drawn from the recent Report of that
Commission. One week ago I attended a Conference in Washington to which the President
had called about 100 lawyers, judges and others concerned with law enforcement, to consider ways of implementing the Crime Commission's Report. In spite of the enormous burdens he carries, the President came to the Conference and, among other things, said that next after the war in Viet Nam, the problems of law en-
forcement ranked highest. We often hear the claim that the breakdown of law and order is due to this
decision or that decision of some court-most often of the Supreme Court. It would be good if things were that simple, for if the overruling of one or two opinions would solve the problems of crime, I suspect the Supreme Court would be willing to reconsider. It is no aid to sensible public discourse to attribute the
crime problem to any one decision or any one court. Unfortunately, the problems and their solutions are far too complex to be
resolved so easily. Let's probe into it. Our whole history as a nation reflects a fear of the power of Government and
a great concern for individual liberty, and these feelings led to place many protections around persons accused of crime. This has resulted in the development of a system of criminal justice in which it is often very difficult to convict even those who are plainly guilty. You know that this was a response to the abuses which people had suffered from the absolutist attitudes of rulers in Europe and in England in the 16th and 17th Centuries.
During the middle of this century-that is, from about 1933 to 1966-We have
witnessed more profound changes in the law of criminal justice than at any other
period in our history. In addition to court decisions, there have been many legislative enactments in both Congress and State Legislatures which have enlarged the protections of a person who Is accused of crime. No nation on earth goes to such lengths or takes such pains to provide safeguards as we do once an accused
person is called before the bar of Justice and until his case Is completed. But governments exist chiefly to foster the rights and interests of its citizens-
to protect their home and property, their persons and their lives. If a govern-
ment falls in this basic duty it is not redeemed by providing even the most perfect system for the protection of the rights of Defendants in the criminal courts. It is
a truism of political philosophy rooted In history that nations and societies often
perish from an excess of their own basic principle. In the vernacular of ordinary
people, we have expressed this by saying, 'Too much of a good thing Is not good." We know that a nation or a community which has no rules and no laws is not a
society but an anarchy in which no rights, either individual or collective, can survive. A people who go to the other extreme and place unlimited power in Government find themselves In a police state, where no rights can survive.
Our system of criminal justice, like our entire political structure was based on the idea of striking a fair balance between the needs of society-we tried to establish order while protecting liberty. It is from this we derive the description of the American system as one of ordered liberty. To maintain this ordered liberty
we must maintain a reasonable balance between the collective need and the Individual right, and this requires periodic examination of the balancing process
as an engineer checks the pressure gauges on his boilers.
What are the dominant characteristics of our system of criminal justice today?
First, it Is a system in which there are many checks and reviews of the acts and decisions of any one person or tribunal. Second it is a system which reduces to a minimum the risk that we will convict an innocent person. Third, it is a system
which provides the utmost respect for the dignity of the human personality without regard to the gravity of the crime charged. There are exceptions to these generalities in some States and In some courts, but I think this Is a fair appraisal of the plus side of our system of criminal justice.
What are some of the negative aspects of our system?
1. Our criminal trials are delayed longer after arrest than in almost any other
system.

2. Our (rihial trials extend over a greater number of days or weeks than IL almost any other system.
3. Accused persons are afforded more appeals and re-trials than under any other system.
4. We afford the accused more procedural protections, such as the exclusion and suppression of evidence and tile dismiissal of cases for Irregularities In the arrests or sea rches, than un(ler aimy other system.
It sometimes happins that a development in the law which is highly desirable, standing alone, interacts with un equally desirable improvement and produces a result which is largely or even totally lacking in social utility. Let me give one example: 'the bail reforms of recent years were long overdue and helped to give mining to the constitutional provisions on ball; similarly the decisions and state utes assuring a lawyer to every person charged with serious crime, were long overdue. Now look at the Interaction: every person charged has a lawyer supplied to him and at tle same time lie has enlarged rights to be released without posting
a conventional ball bond.
We (all now see that In a great many cases, no matter how strong the evidence against him, or low desirable the long range value of a guilty plea and the benefits of reduced charges and more moderate sentencing, 'the two "good" thingsbail reform and free defense--interact to discourage a guilty plea because the "jail house grapevine" tells the accused that the thing to do Is enter a not guilty
plea, demand release without bond, and then use every device of pretrial motions, demands for a new lawyer, and whatnot to delay the moment of truth of the trial day. This means up to two years' freedom during which Nvitnesses might die, or move, or forget details while the case drags on the calendar and consumes untold time of judges, -lawyers and court staffs to process motions and continuances. This is one of the large factors in the congestion of the criminal dockets. Here,
to repeat, two basically good things combine to produce a result never Intended and wholly lacking in social utility or any meaningful relationship to the proper
administration of criminal justice, in short an excess of basic principle. If there is a general impression that the administration of justice is not work-
Ing, one important result is that the deterrent effect of the law and punishment is imnpalred or lost. If people generally-law abiding and lawless alike-think the law is ineffective two serious impacts occur: the decent people experience a sup-
pressed rage, frustration and bitterness and the others feel that they can "get by" with anything.
This is not because the people-good peo)lC or bad people--read the opinions of alpillate courts. Of course they don't. But they read about and hear about the extraordinary cases, and as I suggested, they read and hear most about the failures of the law as in the Chessman and W'illie Lee Stewart type of cases (which ran an agonizing course in the courts for 10, 12 years). Some people, have scornfully said that lawless people never read appellate court opinions. Quite true, but is the real issue whether people read the opinions or is it whether the actions of courts which are widely l)ublieized have an effect on public attitudes? The celebrated case which takes 5 to 10 years to complete Is common talk Ili the best clubs and the worst ghettos. If lax police work and lax prosecution will impair the deterrent effect of the law, repeated reversals and multiple trials in the highly
publicized cases will likely have a similar effect. The existence of "speed traps" and the knowledge of vigorously enforced traffic laws will make us all more careful drivers. Many people, even though not all, will be deterred from serious crimes if they believe that justice is swift and sure. Today no one thinks that.
Is a society which frequently takes 5 to 10 years to dispose of a single criminal case entitled to call itself an "organized" society? Is a judicial system which consistently finds it necessary to try a criminal case 3, 4, 5 times deserving of the confidence and resl.ct of decent people?
These are the negative factors. But by that I do not mean to say that any one of these Is unreasonable or undesirable in and of itself. It is a hard fact, however, that in the present state of law there are more and more cases in which a defendant is tried and re-tried and re-tried again so that the trials and appeals mmy extend anywhere froni 2-3-5 and occasionally as much -as 10 years.
Many people tend to think of the administration of justice in terms of the criminal trial alone because this is the part of the process which occurs in the local conan1UUnity. but maore than that because It is chargedd with the human Mement; it is exciting. colorful and dramatic. This Is why the movies and TV have gIven so much time to criminal trials.

But this is not the whole of the administration of Justice. The total process is
a deadly serious business that begins with an arrest, proceeds through a trial, and is followed by a judgment and a sentence to a term of confinement in a prison or other institution. The administration of justice in any civilized country
must embrace the idea of rehabilitation of the guilty person as well as the protection of society. In recent years, we have been trying to change our thinking in order to de-emphasize punishment and emphasize education and correction.
I have suggested that our system of trials to determine guilt is the most complicated, the most refined, and perhaps the most expensive in the world. We now
supply a lawyer for any person who Is without means and it is the lawyer's
duty to exercise all oeLhis skills to make use of the large number of protective devices available to every defendant. But where do we stand in the second stage
of the administration of criminal justice--the treatment and disposition of those
who are found guilty? We can gain some light by a comparison of our entire system with the countries of North Europe.
To begin with we find that in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Holland, for
example, there is much less crime generally than in the United States. InI Sweden, with a million people, there are about 20 murders each year, and crimes of other kinds are appreciably at a lower rate than in this country. Washington, D.C., with about 800,000 population, has 160-170 murders each year.
I assume that no one will take issue with me when I say that these North
Europe countries are as enlightened as the United States in the value they place on the individual and on human dignity. When we look at the two stages of the administration of criminal justice in those countries, we find some interesting contrasts. They have not found it necessary to establish a system of procedure which makes a criminal trial so complex or so difficult or so long drawn out as in this country. They do not employ our system of 12 men and women as jurors. Generally speaking their criminal trials are before 3 professional judges. They do not consider it necessary to use a device like our 5th Amendment under which an accused person may not be required to testify. They go swiftly, efficiently and directly to the question of whether the accused is guilty. By our standards their system of fluiding the facts concerning guilt or innocence is almost ruthless. In
those systems they do not have cases like Chessman's in California or others you have read about where the accused has countless hearings and trials and re-trials and reviews over 10 or 12 years. In these long drawn out cases everyone loses sight of the factor of guilt and even the most guilty convict comes to
believe the press releases of his own lawyer. Here in our comparison we encounter an interesting paradox. The swift and effi-
cient justice in North Europe is followed by a humane and compassionate disposi-
tion and treatment of the offender. The whole process from the moment of arrest to the beginning of sentence is free from the kind of prolonged conflict which characterizes our administration of criminal justice in which we have glorified and idealized the adversary system with its clash and contest of advocates.
I recently made comparisons of specific cases in Holland, Denmark and in the United States. A typical case in Denmark, for example, is disposed of In about six weeks and the first offender is almost always placed on probation under close supervision and free to return to a gainful occupation and normal family life. It is not unusual, as I have said, for an American case to have 2 or 3 trials and appeals over a period of from 3 to 6 years. When the American defendant is finally sentenced after this prolonged process, he has been engaged in a bitter warfare with
Society for years. Even after the American is committed to a prison we afford him almost unlim-
ited procedures to attack his conviction or seek reduction of his sentence, andas a result American courts are flooded with petitions from prisoners and the war-
fare continues. Under our system the "jailhouse lawyer" has become an institution. In short, while the correction system struggles to help the man reconcile his conflict with Society, the statutes and judicial decisions encourage him to continue the warfare.
If the prisoner is like most human beings his battle with authority and inI the
courts develops a complex of hostilities long before he goes to prison. These hostilities are directed toward the police who caught him, the witnesses who accused him, the District Attorney who prosecuted him, the jurors who judged him, and the judge who sentenced him, and finally, even the free public defender who failed to wiii his case. I doubt that any defendant can conduct even prolonged warfare with Society and not have his hostilities deepened and his chance of

rehabilitation damaged or destroyed. To encourage the continuance of this warfare
with society after he reaches the prison hardly seems a sound part of rehabilita. tion, nor is it likely to contribute to restoring him to good citizenship.
Let me pursue our paradox: when we In America have lavished 3 or 5 or even
10 years of the complex and refined procedural devices of trials, appeals, hearings and reviews on our defendant, our acute concern seems to exhibit itself. Having found the accused guilty-as 80 to 90% of all accused persons are found-we seem to lose our collective Interest in him. In all but a few States we imprison tl1. defendant in places where he will be a poorer human being when he comes out than when he went in-a person with little or no concern for law or for his fellow mei and very often with a fixed hatred of all authority and order, andl he is mind.
lessly and aggressively determined to live by plundering and looting. In referring to the North Europe countries, I do not intend to suggest that they
have completely solved all these problems, but only that they seem to deal with them more Intelligently and less emotionally. They do so by recognizing that for the most part people who commit crimes are out of adjustment with society an( that confusion and personality problems have something to do with this. They
do not find that any useful social purpose is served by giving him 2 or 3 trials and 2 or 3 appeals and drawing out the warfare with Society. And when they finally make the decision to deprive a guilty person of hls liberty, they look ahead to the day when he will be free. They probe deeply for the causes of his behavior and to do this they place behavior scientists in the prisons. We do this, but only
In a token sense. In the Federal Prison System, which is far better than most of the States, there is a ratio of approximately 1 psychiatrist or psychologist for each 1,500 inmates. In the State prisons the ratio of psychiatrists to prisoners is far less-as little as 1 psychiatrist for each 5,000 inmates; some States in tile United States have none. And remember, we are talking about maladjusted peopie confined by Society with a purpose of healing them.
Yet in tiny Denmark the ratio is roughly 1 psychiatrist for each 100 prisoners
and in the maximum security prisons, where the dangerous and incorrigible prisoners are confined, the ratio Is 1 psychiatrist for each 50 prisoners.
The vocational and educational programs available in our best prisons are a
help, but the rate of return of prior offenders shows that something Is not working. With few exceptions In the more enlightened States the basic attitude of Legislatures is that criminals are bad people who do not deserve more. (Wisconsin happens to be among the most advanced of the States and this Is not surprising
when we remember that most of those who populate this State derive from the
enlightened countries of North Europe.) In part the terrible price we are paying in crime is because we have tended-
once the drama of the trial Is over-to regard all criminals as human rubbish. It
would make more sense, from a coldly logical viewpoint, to put all this "rubbish" into a vast incinerator than simply to store it in warehouses for a period of time only to have most of the subject come out of prison and return to their old ways. Some of this must be due to our failure to try-in a really significant way-to change these men while they are confined. The experience of Sweden, Denmark and the other countries I mentioned suggests two things: that swift determina-
tion of guilt and comprehensive study of each human being involved and extensive rehabilitation, education and training may be the way. This, and programs to identify the young offenders at a stage early enough to change them, offer the
best hope anyone has suggested. In all of these countries there is also a more wholesome attitude toward the
prisoner after he is released. Tie churches and the Government cooperate in
maintaining what are called "after-care societies" which have existed for hundreds of years. Through these societies each released prisoner has an experienced and friendly counselor and advisor to assist him with his problems. These people
are volunteers who might be compared with citizens in this country who take part In the VISTA program or the Big Brother movement.
Now you will perhaps be asking what does all this have to do with you. Perhaps only a few of you will become lawyers or Judges or Congressmen. But that is precisely why I have tried to focus your minds on the problem which President Johnson, only last Saturday, placed second to ending the war in Viet Namn.
We lawyers and Judges sometimes tend to fall in love with procedures nn(l techniques and formalism. But as war is too Important to be left to Generals, Justice is far too important to be left exclusively to the technicians of the law.
Tile imbalance in our system of eriinal Justice must be corrected so that we give at least as much attention to the Defendant after lieis found guilty us before.

We must examine into the causes and consequences of the protracted warfare our system of Justice fosters. Whether we find it palatable or not, we must proceed, even in the face of bitter contrary experiences in the belief that every human being has a spark somewhere hidden in hint that will make It possible for redemption and rehabilitation. If we accept the idea that each human, however bad, is a child of God, we must look for that spark.

"The test of probable cause is not what reaction victims--or judges-might have but what the totality of tile circumstances means to police officers. Conduct innocent In the eyes of tile untrained may carry entirely different 'messages' to the experienced or trained observer."
COURTS AND INTEGRATION
Jan. 21, 1969: Carl C. Smuck v. Julius W. Hobson, et at, and Carl F. Hanson v. Julius W. Hobson. These were appeals from a 1967 opinion by Circuit Judge J. Skelly Wright, a colleague of Judge Burger's on the Court of Appeals who heard tile ease because district judges were defendants. The case concerned a finding of racial and economic segregation in District of Columbia schools. (Sce box) Judge Burger dissented from the majority opinion questioning that " ... a subject so complex and elusive, and so far beyond the competence of judges, would have warranted judicial action in tile first instance."
The dissenting opinion noted that Judge Wright himself concluded his lower court opinion by saying it was regrettable that the court must act in an area so alien to its expertise.
Judge Burger noted: "Several commentators have expressed views which undergird . . . the need for caution and restraint by judges when they are asked to enter areas so far beyond judicial competence as the subject of how to run a public school system. We have little difficulty taking judicial notice of the reality that most if not all of the proldems dealt with In the District Court findings and opinion are, and have long been. much debated among school administrators and educators. There is little agreement on these matters, and events often lead experts to conclude that views once held have lost their validity."
JUDICIAL AUTHORITY
Jan. 3, 1961): Rudolph N. Thornton v. Ron. Howard F. Corcoran.Judge Burger said:
"To me it is not simply Irregular for judges to instruct physicians on how they should make a diagnosis; in my view the. order . . . commanding the Superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital to hold a conference and make a tap recording of that conference was a flagrant abuse of judicial power."
SEPARATION OF POWERS
Dec. 13, 1968: Sylvia H. Thompson v. Clark M. Clifford, an appeal challenging the authority of the Secretary of the Army to bar interment at Arlington National Cemetery of Robert G. Thompson, a World War II combat hero subsequently convicted of conspiracy to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government.
Judge Burger concurred with part of the majority opinion but said: "I cannot Join in the reasoning of the court that 'the secretary lacked power to exclude Thompson's remains from interment in a national cemetery . . . because Congress conferred upon the decedent a right to burial . . .I
"Congress . . . specifically provided that the right was conditioned by 'such regulations as the Secretary of the Army may . . . prescribe...... .. I suggest that the majority is simply substituting its personal views of public policy for the policy decisions of the Legislative and Executive branches of governmentand necessarily so because of narrow grounds to the same end. Neither the language of the statute nor legislative history warrants the majority's conclusion."
Sept. 11, 1968: Bruce C. Scott v. John W. Macy, Jr., chairman, U.. Civil Service Commission, et al, a dispute over denial of a federal job based on homosexual grounds. This was another opinion involving a separation of powers. In his dissent Judge Burger said:
"The opinion of the court's majority reveals by its owin terms that it is usurping powers of the policymaking branches of government . . . I would speculate that it can be read as meaning that tile Court now takes over from the Executive the power to formulate 'publite policy' on employment of sex deviates because that 'policy is in something of a state of flux . . .' It would seein to me that if adjustment is needed to changing mores that is indeed a matter of highly sensitive policy. But from whence comes our mandate to make

or even suggest policy on this score or our mandate to denounce the policy of tile con"CstoitnugtrieosnsallayndautthheoriEzexdecburtiavnechm? ake policies in various areas which many reasonable people consider unsound. But policy Is not the busineSS of judges."
FREEDOM OP SPEECH Sept. 25, 1068: Robert Watts v. U.S.A., an appeal from conviction on charges of threatening President Johnson's life at a W.E.B. DuBols Club meeting. Judge Burger said: "Meeting these claims directly, we conclude that the First Amendment does not prevent proscription of utterances that comprises knowing and willful threats to the life or safety of the President . . . Simply because first amendment rights are in the 'balance,' Congress is not precluded from regulating particular individual activity . . . "... The assassination, or even attempted assassination, or suspicion of a conspiracy to this end, of no living person can upset the nation's--even the world's-equilibrium as does such action directed at a President of the United States. "When the interests to be protected are evaluated In the light of first amendment safeguards, the consequences here sought to be prevented afford a valid basis for reasonable limitation on speech."
COURTROOM ETHICS
Sept. 17, 1VW8: John Harris, Jr. v. U.S.A. Judge Burger wrote in the Court's opinion:
"The frequency with which violations of standards of permissible argument occur Is disturbing. We must rely primarily on the trial judges to make clear that they- do not want such argument. Since a large number of lawyers-proseentors and defense attorneys alikt--seem to he uninstructed in the rudimentary elements of proper advocacy, trial judges may well need to take steps to make the 'ground rules' known to the lawyers who appear before them and to deal promptly and firmly with deviations from proper conduct.
"... Lawyers who fall to learn or remember the rules of courtroom conduct may need the forcible reminders which will tend to upgrade the courtroom performance of lawyers generally."
COMMUNICATIONS REGULATION
April 30, 1969: General Telephone Co. of Californiaet al v. Federal (oinmintications Connission. it cable television (CATV) case. Judge Burger said "It seenis clear that as the outlines of the( CATV problem emerged the Commission acted within the scope of the Act (Communications Act of 1934) and consistently with the broad purposes of the Act by treating Its responsibilities as comprehensive and pervasive. Any other determination would tend to fragment the regulation of a communications activity which cannot be regulated on any realistic basis except by a central authority: 50 states and myriad local authorities camtmot effectively deal with bits and pieces of what is really a unified system of communication." Affirming tile FC("s decision and order, he said of the companies involved : "They cannot have the economic benefits of such carriage as they perform and be free of the necessarily pervasive Jurisdiction of the Commission."
CONGRESSIONAL POWER
March 14, 199: Brotherhoodof Locomotire Fircmcn and Enginemen v. National Mediation Board, also National Mcdiation,Board r. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. In a concurring opinion Judge Burger said : "Tile controversies which led to the creation of Board 282 [set up by Congress to Impose compulsory arbitration] and subsequent events might well cause some doubts in Congress as to the Board's construction of the statute, but this cannot encourage us, as admittedly Is often done by judges, to read the statuttes-a euphemismn for rewriting Itas we think Congress should have drafted it. That the course we are compelled to follow may well prolong this unhappy history. of wasteful strife is a matter within the power and province of Congress."

, respect to the conduct of Repreocnta.

This case presents for the first time the question, whether court con con-
sider claims that a Member-elect has been improperly excluded from his seat in the United States House of Representatives. On the basis of findings by that body that Member-elect Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., had been guilty of misconduct as a Member of a prior Congress and of contumacious conduct toward the courts of the State of New York, the House voted to exclude him from the seat In the 90th Congress to which he had been elected in 1966 by the voters of the 18th Congressional District of New York.t
This suit was brought by Mr. Powell
and thirteen voters ' of the 18th Congressional District of New York in the United

tivo Adam Clayton Powell, of New
York. This criticism emanated both from within the Ilouse of tepresenta. tiae nd the public, and related pri.
marily to Representative Powell's atleg d contumacious conduct toward the courts of the State of New York and his alleged official misconduct in the management of his congressional office
and his office as chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor. There
were charges Representative Powell was misusing travel funds and was continuing to employ his wife on his L,,clerk-hlre payroll while she was living in San Juan, P. It.i,n violation of Pub. ', lie Law 89-90, and apparently per. forming few if any official duties.

report (il. lies. itaoJ 2349) was filed Just prior to the end of the 89th Congross. 0 0 * Subsequent to the report of the Hays ,subcommittee and prior to the organization of the 90th Congress, the Democrat Membern-elqct, meeting In caucus, voted to rembvo Representative-elect Powell from his office as chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor.'
The 90th Congress met to organle on January 10, 1967. At that time Member. elect Van Deerlin, of California, objected to the administration of the odth to Momber-elect Powell.' Upon request, Member-elect Powell stepped aside while the oath was administered to the other Members-elect. Shortly thereafter Representative Udall, of Arizona, Introduced a resolution that the oath be administered to Member-elect Powell and that the question of his final right to be seated as a Member of the 90th Congress be referred to a select committee. The debate on this resolution centered on whether to seat Member-elect Powell or to delay his seating pending a committee investigation. Before a vote was taken, Member-elect Powell was permitted to make a statement to the House, The Udall resolution was replaced by a substitute resolution offered by Representative Ford, of MichIgan, which was then adopted an House Resolution 1, 00th Congress, lt Session.0
House Resolution 1 referred to a Solect Committee the question of whether or not Mr. Powell should to seated. This Select Committee was to be comprised of

nine members selected by The Speaker, four of whom would be members of the minority partyI, designated by the MinorIty Leader.- The Select Committee was authorized to hold hearings and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents by subpoena. House Resolution 1 prohibited Mr. Powell from being sworn In or seated until the House acted on the Committee report. Mr. Powell, however, was permitted to receive the pay, allowances, and emoluments of a Member during the course of the investigation, The Select Committee was to report to the House within five weeks after its members were appointed.
On January 19, 1967, The Speaker appointed nine lawyer-Members to the bipartisan Select Committee.7 The Select Committee wrote Mr. Powell on February 1, 1967, inviting him to testify and respond to Interrogation- before the Cornmittee'on February 8, 1967. The stated scope of the testimony and Interrogation was to include Mr. Powell's
qualifications of age, citizenship and inhabitancy, and the following other .,,matters:
', (1) The status of legal proceedings , to which [Mr, Powell was] a party in 1,, the State of New York and in the . Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with particular reference to the instances
in which (he had] been held in contempt of court;

The letter further advised Mr. Powoll that he could be accompanied by counsel and that the hearings would be conducted In accordance with louse Rule Xl, paragraph 90.6
Mr. Powell appeared at the February 8 hearing, accompanied by his attorneys. At this time the Chairman, Mr. Caller, without objection from Mr. Powell, took official notice of the published hearings and conclusions of the Special Subcommittee on Contracts of the Committee on House Administration, relating to the In. vestigation of Mr. Powell conducted dur. ing the 89th Congress. See note 4 supra, and accompanying text. The Chairman then explained that, in addition to the rights set forth in the letter of February 1, counsel for Mr. Powell would be permitted a reasonable length of time for oral argument and Mr. Powell would be permitted to make a statement to the Committee on allmatters as to which he was invited to testify.
Counsel for Mr. Powell moved that the Committee limit its inquiry to Mr. Powell's age, citizenship, and inhabitancy and that, because the scope of the Committee's inquiry was constitutionally limited to these three requirements, It Immediately. terminate Its proceedings and report to the H1ouse that Mr. Powell was entitled to his seat.'s After oral argument on these motions Mr. Powell's aeunsel made several procedural motions

asserting the invalidity of the Committoo proceedings for failure to provide adequate notice and comply with the due process requirements of an adversary proceeding, In addition, certain specific proedural rights wore requested:
1. Fair notice as to the charges now pending against him, including a state. ment of charges and a bill of particu.
tars by any accuser.
, 2. The right to confront his accuser, and in particular to attend in person
,,and by counsel, all sessions of this com. . mittes at which testimony or evidence
i.s taken, and to participate therein .: with full rights of cross-examination.
8. The right fully in every respect to ,- open and public bearings in every re* spect in the proceedings before the
select committee.
4. The right to have this committee Issue its process to summon witnesses whom he may use in his defense.
6. The right to a transcript of every
hearing."
After the Committee took these. motions under advisement, Mr. Powell was questioned by counsel for the Committee. After a few questions, Mr. Powell's coun. sel objected and insisted that Mr. Powell would not proceed further without a ruling on his pending motions.

This is not an adversary proceeding. The committee is going to make every effort that a fair hearing will be afforded, and prior to this date has dosided to give the Member-elect rights beyond those afforded an ordinary witness under the House rules.
The committee has put the Memberelect on notice of the matters into which it will inquire by its notice of the scope of inquiry and its invitation to appear, as well as by conferences with, and a letter from its chief counsl to the counsel for the Member-elect.
Prior to this hearing the committee decided that it would allow the Member-elect the right to an open and publie hearing and the right to transcript of every hearing at which testimony is adduced.

Public Service Commission v. Wykoff, supra note 41, 344 U.S. at 243, 73 S.Ct.
at 240 (emphasis added). Some of the same factors which led us to hold that Judicial consideration of the claims was not appropriate, dictate a holding that %e decline to undertake declaratory re-
lief. Declaratory relief in this Case is particularly inappropriate since it could not finally terminate the controversy,4'
indeed, it might well tend to resurrect the very conflict our holding of inappropriateness seeks to avoid.'3 Our conclusion Is reinforced by Mr. Justice Frankfurter's opinion in Colegrovo v. Green, 328 U.S. 549, 66 S.Ct. 1108, 90 L.Ed. 1432 (1046), which, although modified in other aspects by Baker and its progeny, remains relevant with respect to the discussion of declaratory judgments:

.also limits the powers of courts.

We have already noted that the holding In Bond v. Floyd, Aupra, was bottomed
on state action which imposed a penalty
on Bond for exercising his first amendment rights to discuss public issues. The
Supreme Court's rationale would apply equally if Bond had been excluded from the state university because of his speech. es. The Court did not reach the question
of the standing of Bond's constituents to assert claims on their own behalf. Id.
385 U.S. at 137 n. 14, 87 S.Ct. 339. The class Appellants have not argued their claims In terms of first amendment
rights, but lurking in the language of the Court in Bond can be detected some hint of a possible relationship between first amendment rights to political expression and the related right of voters,
to have their views articulated for them in Congress.4 '

The right to vote is not an academic right; its primary objective is frustrated when the person elected cannot assume the powers and responsibilities of office. Nevertheless, the subject matter of Mr. Powell's claim and the voting claims of the class Appellants are so interrelated that neither can be regarded as having an existence entirely independent of the other; In the context of this case, they stand -or fall together. It must follow that as Mr. Powell's claims are inappropriate for judicial consideration, so also are those of the class Appellants.
Out conclusion that the subject matter of the suit is inappropriate for judicial consideration Is not inconsistent with the conclusion of Judge Hart. Powell v. McCormack, 260 F.Supp. 384 (D.D.C.1907). lIe found that the subject matter embraced a "political question" under Bske.

* As to elected persons santisfyinr all tho requirements in the Constitution, we
are not forced to choose between giving the House absolute power. to unseat whomever It dislikes, and giving the voters absolute power to seat whomever they elect. A third alternative has been adopted, fairly close to the second view., The constitutional qualifications ordinarily suffice; but Congress has rather cautiously imposed some additional tests by statute,M a~d
the'House of Representatives or the Senate has probably added a very few more qualifications by established usage (a sort of legislative common law) to cover certain obvious cases of unfitnoss.
Id. at 257.
Great reliance is placed by Appellants on the views of Professor Charles Warren, another constitutional writer. Professor Warren views section 2 as fixing the only qualifications for membership in the House. Referring to the Convention's refusal to adopt "the proposal to give Congress power to establish qualifications in general (or adopt] * * * the proposal for a property qualification," he concludes:
Such action would seem to make it clear that the Convention did not intend to grant to a single branch of Congress, either to the House or to the

Senate, the right to establish any qualifications for its members, other than those qualifications established by the Constitution itself,. viz., age, citizenship, and residence. For certainly it did not intend that a single branch of Congress should possess a power which the Convention had expressly refused to vent in the whole Congress. As the Constitution, as then drafted, expressly set forth the qualifications of age, citizenship, and residence, and as the Convention refused to grant to Con. gross power to establish qualifications
in general, the maxim expressio unius est exelutlo aUlterius would' seem to apply.

The protagonists for the conflicting views on the scope of exclusion powers of the House draw on the various aspects of history, custom and usage which support their respective positions."

It is not necessary to decide here that there may not be things done, in the one House or the other, of an extraordinary character, for which the members who take part in the act may be held legally responsible.

ter trial whether the particular reller sought should be given. flecousei this second determination involves considera. tios peculiarly committed to Judicial dis. cretion, it is not surprising that, although our identification and weighing of rele. vant factors presents some overlap, each of us has preferred to characterize ill his own words the route he has travelled.
This record demonstrates to me that, front the beginning, Itepresentative 'owell's view of the Constitution hits explicit. ly aid continuously been that, so long as he possesses the requisite qualifications of age, citizenship, and inhabitancy, his right to serve in the House is solely a matter between him and his constituents, not his colleagues. If the voters of hi. district do not like his conduct in office, they can turn him out at the next election; or, if that conduct be thought violativo of the criminal laws, the proper authorities can seek indictments. But, so his reasoning proceeds, for his colleagues to make that conduct the occasion for severance of their association toigother in the House would be, without observance of the amending process, to add further qualification requirements to the throe now stated in the Constitution.
Thus it was that, although the Select Committee expressly Informed him that the scope of Its inquiry included both (1) his qualifications in terms of ago, citizenship, and Inhabitancy, and (2) al. leged misconduct in office warranting expulsion or other punishment, he persist-

only refused to answer any questions or suply any Information except with re. spect to (1). Somewhat helatIdly, hit sought to fortify hin legal position by asserting that the Committee could, at most, take top (2) only after he had been seated, even though he was at the moment of that claim continuing to receive full pay and other allowances and emoluments. flut there Is no reason to think that, had the Committee deferred the second aspect of its inquiry until after seating, his basic constitutional position would have been abandoned,
In the context of the kind of miscon. duct in office Involved here,$ I regard that position as untenable. In saying
this, I distinguish very sharply between conduct abusing tha privileges of hlouse membership, on the one hand, and status or speech, on the other. If the House were to withhold recognition of a member because of his race, or religion, or political or philosophical views, there would indeed have been an addition to qualifications without benefit of constitutional amendment. But the allegations in the complaint which suggest that this Is such a cae are so purely conclusory in character as, under elemental pleading concepts, not to require a hearing on the merits.
Appellant Powell's cause of action for a Judicially compelled seating thus bolls down, in my view, to the narrow issue of whether a member found by his colleagues, after notice and'opportunity for hearing, to have engaged in official mie-

of this case in detail. I agree with some aspects of his opinion--particularly the conclusions in Part I and Part IV. As to other aspects, I am either In disagreement or find it unnecessary to define my posi. tion. It would unduly protract and delay our disposition for me to make a point by point analysis. Accordingly 1 confine
myself at this time to a relatively sparse, almost topic-sentence, statement of my approach, as follows:
1. The complaint on its face presents a matter within the subject-matter Jurisdiction of the District Court. It alleges a claim arising under the Constitution, there is a case or controversy, and there exists a Federal statute giving district courts Jurisdiction to consider such a
case, namely, 28 U.S.C. § 1331. The fact
that this is a novel law suit does not negative jurisdiction. Baker v. Carr. 369 U.S. 186, 82 S.Ct. 691, 7 L.Ed.2d 663 (1962).
2. 1 do not feel required to decide appellees' contention that the ease lacks justiciability, a concept that I think was developed in Baker v.. Carr as defining the kind of case or issue that is Inherently inappropriate for determination by any court,
For example, I am not prepared to say at this juncture that a complainant charging an unconstitutional exclusion from Congress avowedly put on racial or reli. gious grounds cannot obtain a declaratory judgment or other relief. Nor do I consider whether appellant Powell may have available other judicial remedies.

3. In my view the issue presented by the complaint is of such a nature that dismissal it appropriate in the exercise of sound judicial discretion.
Plaintiffs were seeking remedies-mandamus; equity decree; declaratory Judgment--each of which is not necessarily automatically available to one assorting (and even establishing) the underlying right. In an action seeking such remedies a court has discretion In decidIng whether, when and how for to conslder the merits.'
4. For present purposes I assume ap-
pellants are correct in their assertion that Article 1, Section 5, Cl. I of the Constitution is exclusive in stating conditions of eligibility for Congressmen. But that does not mean that appellant Powell was Immune from exclusion on grounds that would Justify expulsion under Article 1, Section 5, Ci. 2.
The record before us shows that the exclusion by the House of appellant Powell was by a vote of 307 to 116, on a motion put forward by its sponsor, Congressman Thomas Curtis of Missouri, on the ground that Mr. Powel's conduct was such as to warrant his expulsionunder Article I, Section 5, Cl. 2 of the Constitution If he were seated, and that he should therefore be excluded at the outset.
Certainly members of the House, who cannot be questioned in court for action taken within a "sphere of legitimate legislative activity,"I can, without being

credit cards, and kept on his payroll a person (his wife) who resided neither in his District nor in the District of Columbia. The fact that the House is not a court, with power to enter a judgment of conviction for violation of laws, does not preclude it from concluding that the pertinent acts were committed by iho Congressman, as a part of an ultimate determination of lack of fitness for service in the House, a determination entrusted to the House by Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2 of the Constitution.
5. Appellant Powell seems to have been of the view that whatever grounds the House may have had to expel him once he was seated, they could not be used as grounds to exclude him without seating him.

Appellants say In rebuttal, inter olis, that the theory advanced by Congressman Curtis is not available to appellees since the House did not accept the need for a % vote, which Mr. Curtis recog. nized as essential. The Speaker announced, on a parliamentary inquiry, that only a majority vote was required for exclusion of appellant Powell.
This contention Is not without force. Bat assuming, argucndo, that the procedure used to exclude Powell may have been Improper that does not mean he is entitled to maintain an action for discretionary relief of a nature that brings a court close to confrontation with membern of the coordinate legislative branch of government. Thus, a court may de. eline to entertain an action based on such

7. It is significant that appellant

Powell, though duly re-elected In April 1967, has not availed himself of the legislative remedy available with this re.
election to assert his claim to represent

his district.

On the argument for stay Powell's counsel indicated that at least one reason, and apparently a major reason, why appellant Powell did not invoke that legis-
lative remedy is that it would not maintain his seniority and chairmanship. Perhaps so, but a court would be going
to the extreme edge of its authority if it
were to declare his status as a Congressman. It cannot reasonably be asked to provide such extraordinary relief to en-

able complainant to obtain perquisites, however important, that are essentially a matter for legislative determination, and certainly are not assured by any constitutional clause. A court has a duty, in the sound exercise of discretion, to consider

litigation seeking relief that raises problems of confrontation with a coordinate branch with an approach that will, wherever possible, confine relief narrow-

ly.

8. If Powell hail acquiesced in the

premise that there was authority to exchide, but only by a IS vote anl 2, ground
rule, there would likely have been a very different kind of legislative situation.

He could not consistently have stood on the position that the Houso and Its Se-

rule after a hearing that admittedly was

warranted in inquiring into various financial and salary arrangements. The premise of permissible exclusion would have undercut the position that permitted

him to defer as a matter of principle any explanation of those arrangements.

9. The various objections lodged by appellant Powell to the procedure of the
House Committee must all be viewed in

the light of his then position that the Committee's scope was restricted to the three Issues of age, citizenship and residence. It cannot be assumed that procedural differences would have loomed as large, or been unmanageable, if appellant Powell had accepted what I think was a valid premise of the House and its Committee. That premise-which I uphold by a ruling on the merits on this issueis that the Constitution gives the House legislative "Jurisdiction," even prior to seating a member-designate, to make inquiry as to whether he has committed acts justifying punishment or expulsion of a member.
10. My approach may not hang tidily on the pegs of jurisprudence thus far called to my attention. It makes sense to me, however, and labels and concepts can emerge In due course.
What seems to have received most discussion in recent years is the concept of Justiciability as a requirement in addition to subject-matter Jurisdiction. As I read them the discussions of justIcia. ability and non-Justiciability have emerged primarily in terms of whether the issue is of a kind that lies within any province of any court at any time. I nfraidn from accepting absoltes About the case before us-to lay it down flatly either that no court may consider the Issue and rule differently from the House, or that there may not be a state of facts that would properly call upon the District Court to grant declaratory and perhaps other relief. There are recent decisions indicating that when there is a determination of both subject-matter Jurisdiction and Justiciability for the issues, the courts are required to decide the issues and to vindicate the applicant's constitutional rights--to refrain from sidestepping this duty merely because the framing of judicial relief presents Jlarge difficulties,4 and to take cognizance of a case seeking declaratory relief even where an injunction cannot properly be obtained.5 By
strict logic the same approach should

an employee of the market, and an oral confession by appellant while detained by the police after his arrest. Appellant offered no evidence In his own behalf. He now argues, as lie did at trial, that the presiding judge should have excluded both the confession and the identifications, and thus left the Government with a case no better than his defense.
Both confessions and identifirations made while an accused is in police custody without benefit of counsel are constitutionally suspect. ' Appellant's contentions on this appeal thus not atypically invoke doctrinal considerations that would have a vitiating effect on each prong of the Government's presentation unless exempted by special conditions. Accordingly, we must examine closely the circumstances surrounding appellant's confession and identifications in order to determine whether they pass the strict tests for admissibility which have been judicially prescribed.
I
Appellant was arrested at 4:15 p.m. on September 7, 1966, pursuant to a warrant issued in connection with a robbery at Mike's Carry Out, and was taken to a precinct station. Upon arrival at about 4:30 p.m., the arresting officer immediately telephoned Detective Sergeant Robert T. Keahon, of the Robbery Squad, who Instructed him to book appellant and bring him directly to the Robbery Squad office at police headquarters. At a pretrial hearing, held to pass upon the admissibility of the confession, Keahon testified that all arrestees brought to a precinct station arc subsequently conveyed to headquarters for processing, that is, fingerprinting, photographing and completion of the "line-up sheet." In addition, Keahon stated that he was personally in possession of appellant's arrest warrant, "was

The arresting officer called in a police wagon from the streets and, when it arrived, drove appellant through closing hour traffic to police headquarters, and presented him to Keahon at 5:20 p.m. Keahon ascertained that appellant had been advised of his rights by the arresting officer, and read to fim from a form which gave the Miranda" warnings in some detail. Appellant said he understood the contents of the form, did not want a lawyer, and would obtain one the next morning if necessary. He then signed a statement to the effect that he knew his rights and did not desire the assistance of counsel.
Keahon then "started talking to him about the Mike's Carry Out," the offense for which he had been arrested, but before he could utter more than a few words, appellant exclaimed, "I don't care, I want to clear Ted. Teddy didn't do It. . . . Teddy didn't shoot that woman In the High's store or rob her. I did." "Teddy," it developed, was one Theodore Moore, who had been arrested for a robbery at a High's Market. With that, appellant proceeded to confess, without prompting, to a series of other recent crimes, the fourth of which was the Meridian Market holdup for which he was convicted in this case. Keahon testified that he asked appellant no questions whatever about that affair except to identify the market appellant was admitting he had robbed.
The Meridian Market confession was made at S:4S p.m. When appellant finished confessing to various other offenses, Keahon brought in witnesses to Identify him.$ Formal processing was completed at about 7:30 p.m., and appellant was taken before the United States Commissioner on the following morning.

Appellant contends that his confession was inadmissible under Mallory v. United States" because it was obtained during a period of unnecessary delay in his presentment before a judicial officer. The Government denies a Mallory violation and argues that, even If there was one, the confession is admissible under Title III of the so-called District of Columbia Crime pill. 7 We think tie record raises a substantial question as to whether appellant's transfer from the precinct station to police headquarters was an unnecessary delay In terms of contemporary judicial construction of Rule 5(a) of the Feder'al Rules of Criminal Procedure.8 We do not, however, reach that question, or the sensitive issues concerning the applicability9 and constitutionality of Title ill which lurk behind it, because the case is properly resolvable on another basis.
Appellant attacks his confession on Miranda'O as well as Mallory grounds, alleging that he did not effectively waive
6354 U.S. 449 (1957). 781 Stat; 734, 735-36 (1967). Title Ill in pertinent part provides:
"Sec. 301(a) Any person arrested in the District of Columbia may be questioned with respect to any matter for a period not' to exceed three hours immediately following his arrest. Such person, shall be advised of and accorded his rights under applicable law respecting any such Interrogation.
"(b) Any statement, admission, or confession made by 4n arrested person within three hours immediately following his arrest shull not be excluded from evidence in the courts of the District of Columbia solely because of delay in presentment."

Now we must consider directly the effect on Mallory of a Miranda that has come of age. -

Although hot explicitly premised on constitutional grounds, Mallory has been ultimately concerned with effectuation of Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections against the dangers of involuntary self-incrimination in stationhouses
and with the other evils inherent in police interrogation of an accused in secret. 14 , [Tjhe delay [in presentment before a magistrate ,"Mallory admonished, "must not be of a nature

"Ilegislation [comparable to Rule 5(a)] ... , requiring

an important safeguard-not only in assuring protection

for the Innocent but also in securing conviction of the

Mallory Itself has stood guard against not only the 'third degree," but also "the pressures in a Police Station upon prisoners under secret Interrogation without counsel, relative or friend."'" These, of course; are precisely the concerns of Miranda.

The Mallory solution for these iniquities was enforcement
by an exclusionary rule of the requirement that the accused be brought "before a judicial officer as quickly as possible so that he may be advised of his rights....,s But this

19354 US. at 454. Mallory and Its progeny have also voiced concern at the possibility that police may interrogate, or otherwise use a delay In presentation before a magistrate, to obtain probable cause to support the arrest. Whenever it appears that an arrest was made with. out probable cause, a question may arise independently of Mallory as to whether evidence subsequently obtained in violation of Rule S(a) must be excluded as fruit of the Illegal arrest. See Adams v. United States, No. 20,547 (D.C. Cir., June 21, 1968); Bynum v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 262 F.2d 465 (1958). Mallory, however, which applies regardless of the legality of the arrest, and which has been read to exclude only testimonial evidence, see cases cited In Adams, suprw, at S n. 4, is il4uited for more than incidental impact on that problem.

remedy was at best imperfect because some delay In presentment is unavoidable and, as Mallory concedes, additional delays for some purposes may be justifiable. 20 Such postponements are, of course, as susceptible to abuses as any others, and experience has exemplified the difficulty inherent In ascertaining either the real purpose of a challoeuntgebdehdinedlaycloosredthestaatciotunahlounsaeturdeooorsf .2in' terrogations carried
In Miranda, the Supreme Court eschewed this uncertain detour through Rule 5(a) and attacked the problem of custodial interrogation directly. It held that the accused is entitled to the assistance of counsel before he is questioned and, In effect, that any confession he makes while in exclusive police custody prior to arraignment is presumptively inadmissible under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Such confesions can stand if, but only if, the accused affirmatively and understandingly waives his rights, and the Governamwenativbeer.a22rs "a heavy burden" in attempting to show such
20354 US. at 455. See also Alston v. United States, super note
11, 121 U.S.App.D.C. at 68, 348 F.2d at 74 (opinion of Judge McGowan).
2 Compare the majority with the dissenting opinions in,e.g., Coor v.United States, 119 US.App.D.C. 259, 340 F.2d 784 (1964), cert. denied 382 U.S.. 1013 (1966); Muschette v. United States, 116 U.S. App.D.C. 239, 322 F.2d 989 (1963), vacated on other grounds 378 U.S. 569 (1964); Heideman v.United States, 104 US.App.D.C. 128, 259 F.2d 943, cert. denied 359 U.S. 959 (1958). This case Itself Is illustrative of the difficulty: the police practice of processing at headquarters persons arrested at the precinct may or may not be essential to efficient police administration; if it Isessential, it nonetheless pre. sets obvious opportunities for improper interrogation.
22After the warnings have been given "'i~fthe interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and astatement istaken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and Intelligently waived his privilege against self. incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.... This Court has always set high standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938), and we reassert these standards as applied to incustody interrogation." Miranda v. Auftona, xur note 3, 384 U.S. at 475.

Thus, absent convincing evidence of waiver,no confession
may be admitted, regardless of the dispatch with which the accused is presented before a magistrate. Conversely, should the Government carry its burden, we think it follows that
the confession is not inadmissible solely on the ground that the accused was not taken before a magistrate at the earliest possible moment. A valid Miranda waiver is necessarily, for the duration of the waiver,23 also a waiver of an immediate judicial warning otO constitutional rights. 24 And what
Miranda, as a constitutional Interpretation, leaves an accused at liberty to yied, lie may, we believe, forego equally under Mallory. 28 Provided the exacting standards for waiver are met, the overriding purpose of Mallory has been served. 26
23A valid waiver ceases to be effective whenever the accused Indi. cates In any manner that he wishes to remain silent or that he wants an attorney. Miranda v.Arizona, supra note 3, 384 U.S. at 473-74.
24Mlranda implicitly assumes thai it is possible for the police to convey to th' accused sufficient understanding of his rights to enable him to make an intelligent waiver. A police warning, to be effective, must be given with proper solicitude for actual understanding. Moreover, a waiver made in the coercive atmosphere of police custody is less likely to be voluntary than one made before a commissioner. Thus the Government carries such a weighty burden of proving waiver io cases involving confessions to. the police. But irrespective of who gives thb warnings or takes the confessions, the ultimate question is whether the waiver is voluntary in the full sense of the word. If an accused did not understand what a magistrate told him, an ensuing confession would not be rendered admissible because he had been advised of his rights by a judicial officer. Similarly; under Miranda, a wigasiv.er may be va.li.d even though made on the basis of police warn-
28wo do not conclude, however, that in waiving his right to remain
silent, the accused also impliedly waives lis, right to complain of a prior violation of Rule S(a). Rather, we construe Mallory not to require exclusion of an otherwise admissible confession because of a brief delay in obtaining aMirandawaiver.
6 Rule S(a) also confers 'upon the, accused a prompt opportunity, to persuade i magistrate, at a preliminary hearing under Rule 5(c),
that there is no probable cause for holding him. While, of course, that policy remains In.force, see Adams v. United States, supra note
19, at 10, Mdloy has enforced It onl coincidentally, since It has no

By no means is this to say that unjustified delay in compliance with Rule 5(a) has no bearing on the admissibility of a confession forthcoming during a period of such delay. As Miranda made clear,
"[whatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver ,of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation of incommunicado incarceration before a. statement, is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights. 'In ,these circumstances "the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling
effect if no Incriminating evidence is obtained as a result of the delay, and since it has been read not to apply where the unnecessary delay in presentment to a magistrate occurs afier a confession, Coor v. United States, supp note 21, 119 U.S.App.D.C. at 260, 349 F.2d at 785; Bailey v United States, 1l17,U.S.App.D.C. 241, 328 F.2d 542, cert. denied 377 U.S. 972 (1964); Lckley vi United States, 106 U.S. AppD.C. 163, 270 F.2d 915 (1959); Porter v United States, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 385, 258 F.2d 685, 692 (1958), cert, denied 360 U.S. 906 (1959); and see United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65,'70.71 (1944).
If probable cause is found, Rule '5(a) still serves to promote early consideration of an accused's admission to bail. This function of the rule has token on added Importance with the enactment of the Bail Reform Act, 80 Stat. '24 (1966), 1$ U.S.C. i 3146 et'seq. But for the same reason that' Mallory has little relevance to the goal of assuring expeditious determination of the existence of probable cause, it Isnot asignificant antidote to the problem of delays Inballhearings.
Rule 5(a) also serves to provide early warning by a magistrate of the right to-ounsel, which may be important inprotecting an accused's interest at. a line p. See Williams V. United States, No. 21,269.70 (D.C. Cr., Dec. 20, 1960). Tlhus, identification eyidence obtained In the absence of counsel may be excluded independently-of the rules of United States v.

Thus, the greater the tardiness in presentment prior to a confession, the heavier the Government's already "heavy burden" of showing effective waiver. Certainly some con-

The record discloses that appellant objected when, as lie

does not appear, but is is noteworthy that Keahon stopped writing at that point. He testified entirely from memory to
the details of the confession, which was made a year before the trial began, explaining that
"at the beginning of his admission, I started to write notes, and he stopped me and said: Don't write anything down. I will tell you about this but I don't want you to write anything down." 3o

The strong implication Is that appellant thought his confession could not be used against him so long as nothing was committed to writing. If, as his avowed motive for confessing suggests, he was brooding over a guilty conscience while the warnings were being given, he might well have failed to absorb their message. Or he may simply have been laboring under the common misapprehension that the police could not use in court anything he said unless they were able to introduce a written statement. Whatever the reason, the evidence raises a serious question as to whether he intelligently waived his right to remain silent. 3'
Appellant was given the Miranda warnings in their entirety. He signed what purported to be an express waiver. If there were no other evidence in the record, the Government would have discharged its burden, and no further inquiry would be necessary.

3tThe thrust of Miranda is that in order to permit "a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self4ncrimination, the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights ... " 384 US. at 467 (emphasis added). Specifically included among the warn. ings the Court found essential to an adequate apprisal is notice of the fact that "anything said can and will be used against the individual in court." Id. at 469. This warning is needed in order to make him aware of the consequences of foregoing his privilege not to speak. "It isonly through an awareness of these consequences that there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege." Id. And as this explanation suggests, a warning is not effective if it is not understood. Thus, contrary to the thesis of the dissent, incriminating statements may be involuntary, and thus "compelled" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, even where the. police are not at fault.

could constitute" a waiver," 32 Miranda teaches that in many circumstances it does not.33 Here, Sergeant Keahon's testi. mony suggests powerfully that the waiver was not underStandingly' made; in addition, the hour appellant spent in custody before the ceremonial "waiver" casts doubt on whether it was voluntarily' made. Since the Government offered no evideftce to dispel these doubts, we cannot say onr this record that it carried its',"heavy burden . . to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his priMilege against self-incrimination. . ,,4,
The Government argues, however, that because the question was not raised below, appellant should not beallowed to present it here. We disagree. Appellant's counse 35 was initially confronted with the signed waiver and what appeared to be a spontaneous confession. It is scarcely surprising that he prepared a Mallory, not a Miranda, argument, The evidence connoting that appellint did.,not understandingly waive his rights did not develop until the direct examination of Sergeant Keahon., Defense counsel then made an apparent attempt to raise the issue in a general way,' but the matter was lost in the Mallory argument he was pursuing. We do not demand more of appellants as a condition to litigation ofissues fundamental in the criminal process. .
Nonetheless, because the Government had no clear warnIng that it would need to produce more evidence, we are reluctant to reverse for a new trial' Appellant's ban Ion note-taking inveighs against intelligent Waiver,, but this inference, might be overcome, for example, if Sergeant Keahon admonished him that even an oral confession would be used against him; and :appellant replied that he knew that but still did not want anythihi Written down. ;Absent some

IV Appellant also contends that the trial judge erred in per. mitting two eyewitnesses to the Meridian Market robbery to identify him at the trial as a participant. His argument is that these in-court identifications were products of prior extrajudicial identifications made in circumstances so unnecessarily suggestive and promotive of faulty recognition as to impinge on due process of law.37 We deferred our disposition of this case to enable evaluation of appellant's claim in the light of the recent Clemons3s decision by the full court. One, but only one, of the pretrial episodes complained of falls within the area of constitutional condemnation. More than a month after appellant's arrest, Louis I. Reznick, the owner of the market, and William Simpson, an employee, both of whom were. present when the holdup occurred, viewed appellant while confined in a cellblock. Appellant was the only person they were shown, and both witnesses knew at the time that appellant had confessed. As the Government now itself characterizes the incident, this single-suspect cellblock confrontation' was "indeed sugges-

tive"; so much so, we hasten to add, as to render it offensive to due process. 39
The Government, however, did not rely upon the out-ofcourt identifications at the trial.40 The question, then, is whether the in-court identifications had a source sufficiently independent of the cellblock exhibition as to be free from its taint.4 The trial court found that there was no taint, and we deem the evidence adequate to support that finding.42
Reznick and Simpson each testified at trial that they remembered appellant from impressions received at the time of the robbery. The offense was perpetrated by two men during daylight hours over a period of several minutes during which both Reznick and Simpson had excellent Opportunities to scrutinize the two robbers. Afterwards, they gave the police detailed joint descriptions of the culprits, one of which depicted appellant reasonably well. In addition, Reznick selected appellant's photograph out of "a box of pictures" given him by the police shortly after appellant's arrest. This evidence, we hold, was sufficient to support the finding that Reznlck's identification was not tainted by the cellblock confrontation.4"
191d. at 16, 25, 32-33. 40The jury did hear a reference to the cellblock confrontation during the direct examination of Reznick. However, even if Reznick's reference amounted to an unintentional introduction into evidence of the out.of-court episode, there was no error if this Identification, like its in-court sequel, had an "independent source." Clemons v. United States, stupra note 38, at 30. 41United States v. Wade, supra note 3, 388 US. at 240; Gilbert v. California, supra note 3, 388 US. at 272; Clemons v. United States, wpra note 38, at 9; Wright v. United States, supra note 36, at 9. 42In Clemons v. United States, supra note 38, at 8, 18, we emphasized the importance of the trial court's considered judgment on this question In the absence of further enlightenment by the Supreme Court. See also id., opinion of Judge Leventhal at 37. 4 3 The reliability of Reznick's in-court identification is additionally supported by appellant's concession that Simpson had correctly iden-

105
As to Simpson, who made no prior photographic identification, the proof on independent source for his in-court identification included a very significant event. On the night of appellant's arrest, Simpson was brought to police headquarters to identify him. According to the uncontradicted testimony of Detective Keahon,
"when Mr. Simpson walked into the office, he saw Frazier and he said: There's the man that approached me in the back and stated, this is a hold-up. And at the same time the Defendant Frazier shook his head; and I asked him what did he mean by shaking his head; and he said: Yes, that is the man that was behind the meat counter."
Ordinarily, an identification arising out of so suggestive a confrontation would itself be constitutionally dubious." Here, however, not only did Simpson identify appellant, but appellant also identified Simpson. There can be no doubt on the record that by "the mah that was behind the meat counter," appellant referred to Simpson's presence there at the time of the robbery. At this juncture, his urge to con fess was so strong that he even acted out one of the other holdups to which he had confessed in order to convince hesitant eyewitnesses to that crime that he had indeed been the perpetrator. His statement, however, is relevant here, not because it is evidence of guilt and thus, indirectly, of the reliability of Simpson's identification, but rather because it tends directly to confirm the existence of an independent source for the challenged identification. And, with this, there could hardly be any "substantial likelihood of irreparable mistaken identification."' 45

(I)
The s6Le Issue separating me from the majority is whether Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) required Appellant's statements to be excluded from the evidence. In answering this question affirmatively the majority leans heavily on Mallory v. United States, 354 US. 449 (1957), the standing of which has been drawn into serious doubt by recent Congressional enactments.' The majority's cognizance 2 of the message that thjs series of legislation bears for Mallory and their apparent agreement with the lower court's finding that Mallory was not violated here, 3 belies Mallory's true significance to the, issues at hand. Moreover it is unsound to treat Mallory and Miranda as closely related; the former is a quantitive test of time delay, the latter is a qualitative test of the circumstances of the Interrogation.4

Of more concern is the majority's expansion of Miranda into a per se exclusionary rule, thereby trnscending the Fifth Amendment requirement that only those statements elicited through compuLvion bb excluded from evidence. Indeed, Miranda itself cannot be read as going beyond the language of the Fifth Amendment, Any lingering doubts on this score were resolved by a recent exposition on the sulbjoct by the Supreme Court. In discussing the scope of Miranda the Court pertinently, noted in Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 303-04 (1966), that, "since at least as long ago as 1807, when Chief Justice Marshall first gave attention to the matter in the trial of Aaron Burr, all have agreed that a necessary element of compulsory selfincrimination is some kind of compulsion". (Emphasis added) (footnote omitted)
In Miranda the Supreme Court held that certain warnings must be given to a suspect before "custodial interrogation" could be conducted. The underlying assumption was that these warnings were necessary to prevent the subversion of trial fights at unsupervised pretriAl confrontations between an accused and the State. Whereas pre.Mlranda cases had alternately Invoked the Fifth and Sixth Amendments'
view fr purposes of arraignment when a suspect walts to make a confession of guilt., In Fuller v. United States, U.S. App. D.C.

STho Mirwida Court expressly disclaimed any intention to traverse beyond the strictptes of the Constitution.

108
Miranda made clear that the Fifth Amendment was the central value at stake. The articulation of a stringent waiver requirement was merely a device through which the Court sought to ensure that Fifth Amendment guarantees were not unduly impaired at pretrial interrogations. The guide. lines set forth in Miranda were means servicing constitutionally prescribed ends; as artifices of implementation they are subordinate and only incidental to the rights they were designed to secure. By postulating a waiver concept the Court did not intend to eclipse the threshold inquiries into the presence of compulsion and the quality of police conduct attending the making of inculpatory statements. This is the background of controlling legal principles on which this case ought to be decided. I do not agree that they give rise to a plausible claim of improper police tactics amounting to coercion requiring reversal or remand.

Frazier was presented to Officer Keahon at headquarters at 5:20 P.M. Their meeting was prefaced by Keahon's reading the Miranda warnings to him from PD-47 (a form card which all police officers carry and which had previously been read to Frazier by Officer Sandy upon his arrest). He repeated these Warnings to Frazier when he read PD-54, a form which advised him of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rightS7 and contained a statement of an intention to waive
Tennessee, 322 US. 143 (1944) and Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936).
/The warning reads as follows: You are under arrest. Before we ask you any questions, you
must understand what your rights are. You have the right to remain silent. You are not required to say anything to us at any time or to answer any questions. Anything you say can be used against you in Court. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advise [sic) before we question You and to have him with you during questioning.

his right to remain silent and his right to counsel. Thereaf. ter. at 5:30 P.M., Frazier himself read this form, orally stated that he understood its meaning,s and signed the waiver.
Officer Keahon testified that lie then read the arrest warrant relating to the robbery of Mike's Carry Out Shop and started to question Frazier on that robbery. But, after Keahon had spoken but a few words, Frazier blurted out his desire to clear a third person who had been arrested for the robbery and shooting at a High's Store. Within minutes Frazier, by way of exculpating others, admitted to his involvement in the robberies at the High's Store, at Mike's Carry Out Shop, at the Dodge Market, and at the Meridian Market-the last robbery being the one for which he was convicted In this case. During this discourse Frazier objected to Officer Keahon's taking written notes. Keahon testified: "At the beginning of his admission, I started to write notes, and lie stopped me and said: 'Don't write anything down. I will tell you about this but I don't want you to write anything down."' [Tr. 72.1
The admission of the Meridian Market robbery was unsolicited and appears to have been volunteered. Officer Keahon testified that he did not ask Frazier whether he participated in the Meridian Market robbery and that the only questions asked in relation to that robbery during the initial confession were for the purpose of corroborating the identification of the market. Thus it seems that the confession was totally spontaneous and voluntary.
Following the statements Frazier was retained in the robbery squad office for nearly two hours, where he was quizzed in detail about the four robberies, reiterated his confessions, was displayed to several witnesses, and reenacted several of the robberies. Thereafter he was placed in

The record demonstrates entirely reasonable police activity satisfying the deterrent purposes underlying the Miranda rule. There is not a scintilla of evidence suggesting that what had been forthcoming from Appellant's lips was the result of unreasonable or improper pQlice conduct. The fact that Appellant may not have desired the statement to be transcribed does not compel the conclusion that he was being subjected to the kind of police activity found unconscionable in Miranda. The most that can be said from Appellant's statements is that he may have unintentionally incriminated himself. TheFifth Amendment, however, serves neither to discourage nor to prohibit self-incrimination, it militates only against 'comnpulory self-incrimination. The record does not even remotely suggest that Appellant was being compelled to incriminate himself, no les' compelled to utter any words at all. There is not the slightest indication that Appellant was unaware of his rights or labored under a misbelief that his failure to speak could be used against him as evidence of guilt. There is no intimation that the environment would have neither permitted 'nor honored a non-waiver.
In. fact, no issue is even purportedly raised as to Appellant's willingness to make the statements that were eventually used against him. Indeed, evidence of his volition may be inferred from his voluntary participation later that evening in a series of identification pj'ocedures. In view of the obvious spontaneity surrounding its making, the statement could plainly have been used as athreshold oral confession."

By equating Frazier's insistence that the police not write notes with a desire not to incriminate himself, the majority engages In sheer speculation of Appellant's thought processes which places a premium on the capacity of judges to probe Appellant's mind. This approach bears an unfortunate
resemblance to the sophistry engaged in by the courts which labored under the albatross of Betts v. Brady." Indeed, the rule requiring courts to peer through kaleidoscopes in search of cor .itutional violations inevitably deteriorated into measu. .,g the constitutional right in terms of the suspect's need-and invariably a horribly guilty suspect at that. Although this theory received currency during the era of "special circumstances", twenty years of inconsistent application'which produced no judicially manageable standards eventually persuaded the Supreme Court in Miranda' 2 to

°ormnpare, e.g., Greenwell v. United States, 119 U.S. App. D.C. 43, 336 F.2d 962 (1964) (allegations of coercion); Spriggs v. United States, 118 U.S. App. D.C. 248, 335 F.2d 283 (1963) (prior denials; repudiation of the confession).

"t By the time of Miranda, Betts had already been overruled by Gideon v.

Lagay,.357 U.S. 504 (1958), and Crooker v. California, 357 US. 433 (1958), the Betits analysis had been directly transposed on the determination of the admissibility ot a confession.

As Judge Bazelon's dissent In Hall v. United States, No. 20,711 (D.C. Cir., decided February 24, 1969) indicates, he too would sub. scribe to "reasonableness" of police conduct as the touchstone of exclusionary rules. Judge Bazelon said there, echoing a multitude of judicial holdings
It is not searShes and seizures as such which the Fourth Amendment enjoins, but only "unreasonable searches and seizures," and the reasonableness of police conduct under the Fourth Amendment isordinarily gauged by what the police reasonably and Ingood faith believed to be the facts at the time of their action. Thus, an arrest made on probable cause is not invalidated because the police were In Iact mistaken in their good faith reasonable belief. * * *
I fail to see how admission of the fruits of such police conduct could sully the integrity of the judicial process. Here was no shocking affront to the dignity of a citizen, cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952), no police "contempt for liw," no "flagrant disregard" of prescribed procedures, no "willful
disobedience of (the) . Constitution . . . ." (slip op. at 6, 9)
Although the Hall case involved the Fourth Amendment everything said in the dissept relates equally to the exclusion of reliable evidence under the Fifth Amendment; see Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 630 (1886), where the Court noted that "the Fourth and Fifth

courts with a more workable method of evaluating the reasonableness of police conduct. The unhappy theory holding the police accountable for environmental and personality factors unavoidably unique to each suspect and frequently beyond the pale of police perception came to rest in the shadow of an exclusionary rule grounded in deterrence. Indeed, the Supreme Court in Johnson v. New Jersey' 4 confirmed the essentially deterrent underpinnings of Miranda and thereby placed its imprimatur on an interpretation focusing on the reasonableness of police conduct instead of the vagaries of human nature.
Miranda did not set down a per se proscription against pretrial questioning; it was addressed primarily to abusive and unwarranted tactics designed to subvert constitutional rights. Even if Frazier unwittingly incriminated himself, the police should not be. held accountable in the absence of some evidence of deceit or misconduct on their part. Here, of course, there is no such evidence. Indeed, the majority clothes Appellant's remarks with a significance beating no relationship to the record or to ordinary human experience. Throughout the majority opinion is circumspect avoidance of any discussion relating to coercion or improper police
Amendments run almost into each other." Compare Note, Consent Searches: A ReappraisalAfter Miranda P.Arzona, 67 COLUM. L. REv. 130 (1967).
Just as reasonableness has been the guidepost for protecting privacy, it also serves as the basis for determining the existence of compulsion. In assessing the legality of an arrest the question Is framed in terms of whether the police officer had prob. able cause to believe a crime had been committed; similarly, in determining the admissibility of a confession, the question is whether there was sufficient reason for the police to believe that the suspect had consented to being questioned. In both instances the judicially declared objective of the rules is to prevent the police from reaping the benefit of official misconduct. Here Appellant is unable even to allege any police misconduct, hence the underlying predicate of the exclusionary rule is totally absent. In such circumstances there an be no justification for suppressing the evidence.

conduct. To the extent Appellant's utterances may be construed as indicating i misunderstanding of the consequences of his making incriminatory statements the majority has failed to supply a nexus between this and the presence of improper police conduct amounting to coercion.
I have difficulty perceiving the basis for the majority's argument that it was unreasonable for the police to proceed with questions after Frazier made an apparently valid waiver. Although this waiver was not irrevocable, . s there is nothing to show that Frazier indicated "in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wished) to remain silent" or that he wanted an attorney.

to investigate promptly the circumstances of the crime and the suspect's possible parflicipation. I am somewhat at a loss to know what more the Government could or should have done to comply with the directives of Miranda. Even if Frazier did not understand the privilege against selfincrimination, the majority's approach is unrealistic and goes beyond the mandates of any'decided cases. It seemingly expects the police to detect indications of misunderstanding and lack of knowledge which are so subtle that not even judges would recognize the problem.
The seeming anxiety of judges to protect every 'accused person from every consequence of his voluntary utterances is giving rise to myriad rules, sub-rules, variations and exceptions which even the most alert and sophisticated lawyers and 'judges are taxed to follow. Each time judges add nuances to these "rules" we make it less likely that any police officer will be able to follow' the guidelines we lay down. We are approaching the predicament of the centipede on the flypaper-each time one leg is placed to give support for relief of a leg already "stuck", another becomes captive
