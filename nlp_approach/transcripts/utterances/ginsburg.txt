Thank you. 

I do, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have such a large family with me today, such an extended family, not just the immediate people behind me who I will introduce, but my friends, my law clerks, my secretaries. My heart is overflowing, because those are the people who have made it possible for me to be here today. But let me start with my nephew, Peter Stiepleman. 

My brother-in-law, Ed Stiepleman. 

My wonderful sister-in-law, Claire Stiepleman. And one of my wonderful law clerks who is representing all the rest, Al Cacozza. My life's partner for 39 years, Martin Ginsburg. 

And my son from the great State of Chicago, James Ginsburg. 

And his very special friend, Lisa Brauston. 

And my incredible daughter, Jane Ginsburg and Clara. 

She sure does, and, you know, people think I am very serious and sober as a judge, and so when I had all you people taking photographs of me in the White House, people were trying to get me to smile, and they said think of Clara. 

Then my grandson, Paul Spera. I must tell you that, in preparation for these hearings, I have read briefing books, opinion books, law reviews, but there is no book in the world that means as much to me as this one. This is Paul's book. It says, "My Grandma is Very, Very Special," by Paul Spera. I thank you, Paul, for this wonderful book. 

It ends with a map of the United States of America. 

And my son-in-law, George T. Spera, Jr. 

And Christine, au pair from Belgium, who has been taking such wonderful care of the children.Then, on behalf of my cousins who I reckon by the dozen, Stephen Hess.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, and other members of the committee. May I say first how much I appreciate the time committee members took to greet me in the weeks immediately following the President's nomination. It was a particularly busy time for you, and I thank you all the more for your courtesy. To Senator Moynihan, who has been at my side every step of the way, a thousand thanks could not begin to convey my appreciation. Despite the heavy demands on his time, during trying days of budget reconciliation, he accompanied me on visits to Senate members, he gave over his own desk for my use, he buoyed up my spirits whenever a lift was needed. In all, he served as the kindest, wisest counselor a nominee could have. 

My children decided at an early age that mother's sense of humor needed improvement. They tried to supply that improvement, and kept a book to record their successes. The book was called "Mommy Laughed." My visit with 

That is fine, Mr. Chairman. 

Yes. 

Yes. And then, at the opposite pole, I said, these sex-based classifications that riddle our statute books couldn't even pass the lowest level of review, the rational basis test. The first case in which those arguments were presented was a very simple one. It was the case of Sally Reed, whose young son—a teen-aged boy—died under tragic circumstances. Sally Reed applied to be administrator of her son's estate. The boy's father— the parents were separated at that point—also applied to be administrator. The State of Idaho at that time had a rule—a statute—for deciding such cases. The rule was: As between persons equally entitled to administer a decedent's estate, males must be preferred to females. It may be astonishing to some of the young people sitting behind you that laws like that were on the books in the States of the United States in the early 1970's, but they were. And there were many of them. There had never been in the history of the United States any instance in which any law that differentiated on the basis of sex had been declared unconstitutional up to Reed v. Reed (1971). 

A number of them. But without reciting that entire history, as an advocate I presented to the Court different ways that the Justices could reach the decision in Sally Reed's case, which was as clear on its facts as any case could be.122 That was the position I took as an advocate. My expectation, to be candid, was that I would repeat that kind of argument maybe half a dozen times. 

But what was his understanding of "all men are created equal" for his day, for his time? It was that "the breasts of women were not made for political convulsion." So I see an immediate intent about how an ideal is going to be recognized at a given time and place, but also a larger aspiration as our society improves. I think the Framers were intending to create a more perfect union that would become ever more perfect over time. 

Senator Hatch, the Hammon (1987) case is not in the front of my mind. As you have pointed out, I wasn't on the panel that made the decision in that case. 

This was a 

I think it is important, though, to understand the difference between being part of a full court and being a member of a three-judge panel, which I was not. I was not one of the decisionmakers in the Hammon case, I was simply a member of the court, and all of us voted whether to hear the case en bane. But I was not part of any decision in that case. 

Right, Paul Johnson was the plaintiff and he complained that Diane Joyce had gotten a job he should have gotten, and it was a result of the affirmative action plan. That was a case that was much discussed. I will tell you a nonlegal reaction I had to it. The case involved a department that had 238 positions, and not one before Diane Joyce was ever held by a woman. After an initial screening, 12 people qualified for the job. That number was further reduced until there were 7 considered well qualified for the job. Then the final selection was made. On the point score, Paul Johnson came out slightly higher than Diane Joyce, but part of the composite score was determined by a subjective test, an interview, if I recall correctly, and they were scored on the basis of the interview. I thought back to the days when I was in law school. I did fine on the pen and paper tests. I had good grades. And then I had interviews. I didn't score as high as the men on the interviews. I was screened out on the basis of the interviews. So I wonder whether the kind of program that was involved in the Johnson (1987) case was no preference at all, but a safeguard,131 a check against unconscious bias, bias that may even have been conscious way back in the fifties. In a department that has 238 positions and none of them are filled by women, perhaps the slight plus—one must always recognize that there is another interest at stake in the cases, Paul Johnson's—checks against the prospect that the employer was in fact engaged unconsciously in denying full and equal opportunity to women.These are very difficult cases and each one has to be studied in its own particular context. But in that case, at least, I related back to my own experience. Whenever a subjective test is involved, there is that concern. If you are a member of the group that has up until now been left out, you wonder whether the person conducting the interview finds you unfamiliar, finds himself slightly uncomfortable, thinking about you being part of a workplace that up until then has been, say, all-white or all-male.I did want to make one comment, if you will allow me, Senator Hatch.

Yes. When I think about one of my wonderful District of Columbia circuit colleagues, Judge Skelley Wright, who was a brave district judge in New Orleans in the 1960's, a judge who for 10 years tried to implement the Brown decision, when massive resistance was mounted against it. But he did what a good judge should do, he enforced the law. 

It came on me incrementally, one might say. There were many indignities one accepted as just part of the scenery, just the way it was. For example, when I was at Harvard Law School, I was on the Law Review and I was sent to check a periodical in Lamont Library in the old periodical room. When I got there, it was quite late at night, and I wanted to make sure I got home by midnight. My daughter, the professor, was then 14 months old—no, that was my second year, so she was a few months over 2 years old. And I wanted to look up the citation, report back, and return home.There was a man at the door, and he said, "You can't come in." "Well, why can't I come in?" "Because you're a female." "But the library at Harvard is open to women," I protested, "Widener is open to women." This one room in Lamont, however, remained a symbol of the way things were. It was closed to women. There was nothing I could do to open the door guarded by a university employee who said, "You can't enter that room."The Harvard Law Review had a banquet. I was allowed to invite my spouse, and I was also allowed to invite my father or fatherin-law. But I wanted to invite my wonderful mother-in-law, who has been, next to my husband, my biggest booster, the greatest supporter imaginable. But I couldn't invite her because the Law Review dinner was just for men. The couple of women who were on Law Review—there were two of us—were allowed to come, but not the wives of the men on the Review and no mothers, only fathers.Experiences like that and the trouble I had getting a job when I finished law school, all

Yes. That was amusing. Cornell, in the days I was there, had a 4-to-l ratio. It had four men for every woman. The reason they gave for having that quota in the Arts and Science college—it was indeed a restrictive quota system—was that the girls had to live on campus, the boys could live in town. The men could find apartments and live in town, but the girls needed to be sheltered, to have curfews and check-ins. And there were only a certain number of dormitory spaces. Then I enroll in the Harvard Law School, and there is a fine complex of dormitories, but all the rooms are reserved for men. No places in Holmes Hall for the girls. The girls had to find their own places in town. So it was just the reverse. Harvard's scheme compared to Cornell's showed how irrational it all was. 

Oh, yes. That was many years later in 1971. I visited Harvard Law School to teach a course on women and the law. It was the first such course Harvard offered. The faculty club, the Harvard Faculty Club, up until that 1971 fall term, had the dining room and the ladies' dining room. If you were a lady, until that term, you didn't have a choice. You went to the ladies' dining room. I asked to be seated in the dining room and the hostess said to me, "Well, dear, you are allowed to dine in the Dining Room, but wouldn't you really feel more comfortable in the Ladies' Dining Room?" 

I can tell you what I did. I had my meal in the dining room. The way the world was just a generation or two ago is something that, as I said before, today young people can hardly grasp. One of my favorite stories concerned a case, a men's rights case, an early title VII case called Diaz v. Pan American WorldAirways (1971). The plaintiff was a man who wanted to be a cabin attendant, but that particular airline hired only women. You may remember the days of "I'm Cheryl, fly me." The Diaz case was part of that era. I was having lunch with some law school colleagues at the U.N. dining room where we met to discuss a proposed commercial law treaty. And one of the men said to me, "I understand what you are doing, Ruth, and it is great you are all for equality, and we are, too. But some of this is getting beyond reason. You know about that case of a guy who wants to be a stewardess? Isn't that silly?" The waitress serving our table came to my aid. She said, "Pardon me, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. I just came back to the United States on Alitalia, and on that plane there was the most adorable steward." The men turned to me, and one said, "Ruth, do women look at men that way?" And I said, "You're darn right we do." [Laughter.] 

The first series of cases I handled were not big Federal cases. Many States had moved ahead of the Congress. The 1964 title VII legislation trailed a number of States that had already enacted State human rights laws, States that in some instances included sex along with race, national origin, and religion as a proscribed basis for discrimination.136 I got into the sex equality advocacy business through two doors: one was opened by my students who, in the late 1960's and early 1970's, encouraged the faculty to offer a course in this area; the other was opened by complaints that began to trickle into the New Jersey affiliate of the ACLU. I will describe a typical one: A school teacher becomes pregnant, and is told she must leave work—in the third month or the fourth, or as the pregnancy begins to show. She is put on what was euphemistically called maternity leave, which meant no pay, no benefits, no health benefits. "We will call you back if we have a need for you." That was about the size of it. Many of the women in that situation were schoolteachers. Some were in other fields. I recall another typical case, one involving the Lipton Tea Co. The complainant's employer had a fine health plan. Her husband's employer didn't have an equally fine plan. So she wanted to sign up with her employer to get the more advantageous plan for herself, her spouse, and her children. And she was told, "Women can get health coverage under our plan only for themselves. We have family coverage only for male workers." That was another category of case. 

Then we will have 

Why don't we go another 30 minutes and then take a break, if that is satisfactory. 

Senator Thurmond, aid to schools is a question that comes up again and again before the Supreme Court. This is the very kind of question that I ruled out. 

Yes. 

Senator Thurmond, that is the kind of questions that a judge cannot answer at-large. The judge will consider a specific program in a specific school situation, together with the legal arguments for or against that program, but it cannot be answered in the abstract. As you so well know, judges work from the particular case, not from the general proposition. 

Senator, I can say only this: The Constitution requires that equal opportunity be given for boys and girls, equal opportunity for education. I will report on one class of cases in which I was involved. They were easy cases, because there was an exclusion, an imbalance in opportunity. I worked at Rutgers University for 9 years. The main college was all-male when I began working there. There was also a very fine school, Douglas, much smaller, for women. But the State had many more places for male students than it had for female students. That was wrong. The way it was eventually cured was fine. Rutgers opened its doors to female students, the women's college remained separate. I think it remains separate to this day. But the State can't say we are going to have separate education and we are going to have many more places for men than for women. Other cases in which I was involved concerned Princeton, a private university. Princeton had a wonderful program for sixth graders. That program took sixth graders from the community and gave them an enriched learning experience, an introduction to math and science. The program included followup instruction in the students' high school years. This program was designed for children who were disadvantage*!, children who did not go to private schools. They went to public schools and they lived in neighborhoods that weren't affluent. It was a wonderful program, but it was only for boys. 

Senator Thurmond, I have expressed my view that the Constitution requires that the State treat people, boys and girls, equally. The cases I have described to you all involved either separate and nonexistent for girls, or separate and not equal. That is as far as my experience goes. 

Senator Thurmond, as I have told Senator Hatch in our conversations, there is nothing that a judge would like better than to have a highly activist legislature passing the laws, making clear its positions on policy and on implementation. The tremendous difference between legislators who decide what policies should be, then write laws to implement those policies, and judges is that you design the plate and you put things on it. Judges never make business for themselves. Judges don't create cases. Cases come to court, brought by parties; and if it is a case of what James Madison called a judiciary nature, then the judges have no choice. They must decide it, no matter how much they would like to avoid decision. Judge Irving Goldberg of the fifth circuit described it—and I quoted him in that University of Georgia article—this way: He compared judges to firefighters. They don't light the fire, but they are obliged to put it out. Judges are reactive. They don't make the cases or controversies that come before them, but if they are proper143 judicial cases, judges are obliged to decide them no matter how unpopular the decision may be to some group or another.

Senator Thurmond, may I put the Jenkins case in its context, as I understand it, and preface my response with Madison's words about the Federal courts James Madison said that with the Bill of Rights, he anticipated that the Federal courts would consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of the rights incorporated in the Bill of Rights. He expected the judges to be an impenetrable bulwark, naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights stipulated for in the Constitution by the Declaration of Rights.One of those rights, after adoption of the 14th amendment, is the right to equal protection of the laws. What was involved in that case, as I understand, was desegregation in schools. Federal courts don't make those cases. Every judge I know who has been involved in one has found it distressing, stressful, not what that judge144 would choose to do. And every effort is made in those cases to have the community decide for itself, to come up with a plan that will cure a violation of rights.Once a violation of rights, of constitutional rights, is proved, then it becomes the Court's responsibility to impose relief, to grant relief, to work out a remedy. Now, courts will work out a remedy themselves only as the very last resort, after trying in every way possible to have the people's elected representatives do the job that they should do.I can't talk to the specifics of this particular case, but I do know that no judge, no Federal judge, to my knowledge, ever invites this kind of case. When the case comes to court, the judges will do everything they can to have the remedy worked out among the people involved in the case. And only when nothing else works will the judge then step in and fulfill, as best as she or he can, the judge's constitutional responsibility.

Senator Thurmond, the Shaw (1993) case to which you referred was returned to a lower court. The chance that it will return again to a higher court is hardly remote. It is hardly remote for that very case. It is almost certain that other cases like it will come up. These are very taxing questions. I think the Supreme Court already has redistricting cases on its docket for next year, so this is the very kind of question it would be injudicious for me to address.

YOU have described a measure that you support and, therefore, hope and expect may someday pass. That being the145 case, you are describing a future controversy that may very well come before the Court.

Yes. 

I know, Senator Thurmond, that there is in this area a great tension between two important principles. The one to which you have referred is finality. All things must come to an end, and that is important in the law. Controversies must be decided, and people must go on about their business. So finality is important. But fairness is also important and, unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world where people get the best representation the first time they come to court. 

These concerns, finality and fairness, are in tension, and they must be balanced in the particular case. I should add that, unlike Federal judges in many other places, judges in the District of Columbia Circuit do not have experience with the kind of habeas petitions you have in mind. Congress, when it created the separate District of Columbia court system, established courts with judges appointed by the President, gave them a postconviction remedy that is identical to 2255 of title 28, the Federal postconviction remedy, and then indicated, you go from the District of Columbia courts to the Supreme Court, if the Supreme Court will take your case. There is no Federal habeas review when you get through with the District of Columbia courts. So we don't get the kind of habeas corpus business that the fourth circuit and the other regional circuits get. So I appreciate the tension between finality and fairness. I have not had the experience that some of my colleagues on the Federal bench have had with the habeas jurisdiction. 

Yes, I understand that Congress has and will continue to give consideration to the Powell report. 

I think that every Justice of the Supreme Court and every Federal judge would subscribe to the principle that a judge must do what he or she determines to be legally right. 

From the announcements we have seen in the paper today, yes, the questions that you have outlined certainly could come up. 

Thank you. 

Yes, Senator Metzenbaum, I will try. The statement you made about the law moving in a reform direction is taken directly from Justice Blackmun's decision in Roe (1973) itself. He explained that, until recently, the law in the States had been overwhelmingly like the Texas law, but that there had been a trend in the direction of reform. The trend had proceded to the extent that some one-third of the States, in a span of a very few years, had reformed their abortion laws from the point where only the life of the woman was protected. In relatively few years, one-third of the149 States had moved from that position to a variety of positions. Most of the States followed the American Law Institute model, allowing abortion on grounds of rape, incest, and some other grounds. Four States had by then moved to permit abortion on the woman's request as advised by her doctor.So I took that statement not from any source other than the very opinion, which I surely do not criticize for making that point. I accept it just as it was made in Roe v. Wade.

There was a very strong dissent in Conair to that effect, whether you needed to have a showing of a majority at any time. Strong arguments can be made either way, Senator. I am simply saying that there is written into that Act, the NLRA, the principle that underlies so much of our society, and that is the principle of majority rule. The NLRA says it is the employees' choice. There was another factor in Conair, as you know. Because of the way, unfortunately, the process moves, by the time that case came to our court there had been—by the time it got to the Board for decision, no less the court, by that time, there had been a total turnover of employees. So none of the people who were in that shop at the time the Board decided the case had been exposed to the employer's egregious practices. If the Board had succeeded in imposing a bargaining order at that point, the NLRB would have imposed the order on a whole new set of employees. So that was a factor, too. 

It took the better part of a year to get and sell a replacement certificate. It meant that for one entire term of the court, I was recused from all El Paso cases, not because of my husband's law practice, but simply because my son was given at birth one share then worth $10 of El Paso Natural Gas. That experience, and others like it, might lead Congress to rethink whether the statute really should say "financial interest, however small." There should perhaps be a de minimis principle installed. 

NO, Senator, I don't think so. I don't think I have the highest recusal rate on my court. On automatic recusals, I probably come out, taking 13 years into account, somewhere in the middle, I would guess. The telephone company recusals didn't come in time to allow me to escape from the huge access charge case. I did sit on that. It was a complex case, with an opinion divided three ways among the panelists. 

Senator Simpson, the initial concern of the first amendment is with the Government as censor. I don't think the first amendment says that the Government can't choose Shakespeare over modern theater, David Mamet, for example, in deciding what programs it wants to support, say, for public performances. It can't shut down speech, but it can purchase according to its preference, within limits.So although the first amendment keeps the Government from squelching speech on the basis of its content, I don't think anyone has taken the first amendment or the equal protection principle to the length of saying Government must fund equally anything that anyone considers art. I think the Government as a consumer doesn't have to buy all art equally.

Senator, if there is any message I would like the public to understand about courts, it is that courts don't make controversies; courts don't choose what they do. Courts are constrained, as you know, Federal courts, by article III. Article III tells Congress what it may give the Federal courts to do, and Congress is limited in this way, too. Congress can't put on our plate something that isn't included in one of the article III categories.So the courts are limited, first, by the case or controversy requirement. A case of a judiciary nature has to be a live controversy between adverse parties. Federal courts are limited in the subject matter of the cases they may hear, and there are a host of requirements that people must meet in order to have a justiciable case or controversy. Those stem from the Constitution first, then from the laws that Congress passes in conferring or withholding jurisdiction from the Federal courts, and then from precedent built up since the Nation was new.So no judge can decide what is appropriate for a court to do. All of what judges do is heavily constrained by the Constitution, the laws, the decisions, and the traditions that have been built up over 200 years.

Thank you. [Whereupon, at 7:29 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to reconvene at 10 a.m., Wednesday, July 21, 1993.]NOMINATION OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG, TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESWEDNESDAY, JULY 21, 1993U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:12 a.m., in room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee), presiding. Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Specter, Brown, Cohen, and Pressler. 

That is just fine. Thank you. 

Senator DeConcini, I don't recall the words that you read. It was always my view that distinctions on the basis of gender should be treated most skeptically because, historically, virtually every classification that, in fact, limited women's opportunities was regarded as one cast benignly in her favor. I tried yesterday to trace the difference between racial classifications, Jim Crow laws—which were not obscure in the message that one race was regarded as inferior to the other—and gender classifications that were always rationalized as favors to women. My165 constant position was that these classifications must be rethought. Are they genuinely favorable, or are they indications of stereotypical thinking about the way women or men are. And that

Senator DeConcini, as an advocate, I urged the highest level of scrutiny and

After it became clear as a strategic matter that there was not a fifth vote soon to declare sex a "suspect" category, I tried to establish a middle tier. In fact, I did that even earlier— the Frontiero (1973) Brief was the first time. Briefs I presented gave the Court two choices in Reed (1971), three in Frontiero and in Capt. Susan Struck's case. As you know, I was an advocate of the equal rights amendment. I still am. 

SO I think that answers your question about the level of scrutiny that 

I will try to answer your question this way. The last time the Supreme Court addressed this question, as I mentioned yesterday, was in the Mississippi University for Women (1982) case. The Court struck down a gender-based classification and said in a footnote that the question whether sex should be regarded as a suspect classification was one not necessary to decide that day; we don't have to go that far, the Court explained, to resolve the case at hand. It thus remains an open question before the Supreme Court. 

I can't, sitting where I am now 

I would be glad to respond regarding that particular piece. At the moment, I don't recognize the words as mine. 

Yes, there is. I hesitate every time I say "gender-based discrimination" because I have been strongly criticized by an academic colleague for whom I have the highest respect. He tells me, "That term belongs in the grammar books; the word for what you have in mind is 'sex' and why don't you use it?" And I will tell you why I don't use it. In the 1970's, when I was at Columbia and writing briefs, articles, and speeches about distinctions based on sex, I had a bright secretary. She said one day, "I have been typing this word, sex, sex, sex, over and over. Let me tell you, the audience you are addressing, the men you are addressing"—and they were all men in the appellate courts in those days—"the first association of that word is not what you are talking about. So I suggest that you use a grammar-book term. Use the word 'gender.' It will ward off distracting associations." 

Yes. And, Millicent, if you are somewhere watching this, I owe it all to you. [Laughter.] 

From my viewpoint, they were reflecting social changes and putting the imprimatur of the law on the direction of change that was ongoing in society. Yesterday I described the Hoyt167 (1961) case, Gwendolyn Hoyt's case, the case of the woman who, in an altercation with her husband, hit him over the head with a broken baseball bat, her son's broken baseball bat, and as a result, ended up being prosecuted and convicted of second-degree murder. When I mentioned that 1961 Supreme Court decision, I said there was no possibility of winning that case at the time it arose. No one would listen to the argument that this exemption from jury service wasn't pure favor to women.One of you mentioned yesterday—I think it was Senator Kennedy—the case of Goesaert v. Cleary (1948). That was about a mother and daughter who owned and operated a bar in the State of Michigan. The mother owned the bar. The mother and the daughter wanted to tend the bar that they themselves owned. But Michigan law, as was said yesterday, declared that a woman could not tend bar unless she was the wife or the daughter of a male barowner.That mother and daughter found that Michigan's law effectively put them out of business. The rationale for the law was that bartending wasn't safe; rather, it was a risky occupation. So women were being protected. They were being sheltered from working in such a setting, absent a father figure, or a husband, as the owner.In my law school constitutional law casebook, I remember the Goesaert case being treated simply as an illustration of the Supreme Court's retreat from the Lochner (1905) era, in which the Court regularly struck down economic and social legislation. Hardly a word was said about the mother and daughter, the people Michigan's law put out of business. That was 1948. The case was regarded as a typical example of the Court's retreat from a body of decisions that interfered with legislative judgments about economic and social legislation.So there really was no chance that any court in the land, and certainly not the Supreme Court, was going to move until there were pervasive changes in society. Change in the mid-1900's perhaps started during World War II, when women took jobs that had been considered, up until then, jobs only men could do. You remember Rosie the Riveter. There was a time after the war when women were told to go back home, don't compete with men for jobs. But then many things came together. One factor was inflation. The two-earner family became a pattern people accepted out of necessity, out of caring for—wanting to provide the best for—their children. Factors that coalesced included women's opportunity to control their reproductive capacity, the two-earner family pattern, longer life spans, the woman having a life at home and at work.A number of factors came together to change women's lives, to alter and expand what they were doing.

Yes. 

I won't comment on that. As I said, I have given you examples from the past.

If you are satisfied with my answer, I will be glad to move on.

Are you pointing to something in my answer to the questionnaire? 

The examples I gave were of the cases in which the courts have been most criticized. Frankly, I criticized in returnthe legislatures and the executives who wouldn't take action when they should have. I spoke primarily of the school cases, the institutional cases, hospital and prison cases. These are cases, I observed, that courts do not like; judges feel extremely uncomfortable having to deal with them. But I gave the example, I think, of Judge Johnson in Alabama who was severely criticized for attempting to run the prisons in Alabama. He gave this account of it. He said, "The State's attorney stood up in my court and said that every prison in this State is in violation of the eighth amendment." At that point, what the law required him to do was clear. His own competence to do it, he was most doubtful about that, but he was bound by the law—by the Nation's highest law—to supply a remedy.He explained how he tried in every way to have that remedy come from the State officials, but in the end, when it didn't, the Court has to supply it.

As I said, I think the courts have gotten the most heat for that institutional litigation—for trying to run schools, for trying to run hospitals.

Then he said they must do so interstitially. 

I think I gave an example. One of the Senators referred to it; perhaps it was Senator Specter yesterday. It was in an article I wrote about a series of cases in which the Court acted, in effect, as an interim legislature. The article concerned the appropriate remedy when someone is challenging a classification that affords benefits and says, "I want in." Sharron Frontiero's suit was such a case. So was Stephen Wiesenfeld's. 

Either way, the Court is, in effect, legislating. Let me explain what I mean. The Frontiero (1973) case involved housing allowance and medical facilities for a spouse, benefits automatically available for the spouse of a male member of the military, but not available for the spouse of a female member unless she supplied effectively threequarters of the family's support, all of her own plus half of his. The Court said that the gender line was invalid. Now, if at that point the Court had said, "And until the legislature convenes again, there shall be no housing allowance, no medical benefits for anybody," that would have been far more destructive of the legislative will than letting in the women members who had been left out.171 The same is true in Stephen Wiesenfeld's case. The benefit he sought was labeled a mother's benefit. He never would 

Good morning, Senator. 

Senator Grassley, for a host of reasons. One, is courts are not equipped to get the kind of information that legislators can get. You are addressing a problem, for example, what kind of legislation you should have to prevent air pollution. You have tremendous resources you can use to investigate, to find out about the problems you are confronting. Legislatures can engage in the kind of fact-finding that courts are not set up to do.Of course, the fundamental policy decisions are entrusted to the legislative branch. The Court hears a controversy, one of a judiciary nature, generally between two parties.

Again, Senator Grassley, I think I must avoid expressing anything concerning 

May I offer an example from real life, something that happened to me. It explains why I am sensitive on this subject. There was a case before my court, titled Murray v. Buchanan (1983). It was a challenge not to the offices of the chaplains in the House and Senate. The case, in some accounts, has been inaccurately portrayed. There was no challenge to opening the sessions of the Senate and the House with prayer. There was never any challenge to having a chaplain. But there was in that case a challenge to using taxpayer money to fund the offices of the chaplains. The people who brought that suit were not very popular people— Murray was the name, the son of Madeline O'Hare Murray was the lead plaintiff. The only question before my court was whether the plaintiffs had standing to raise their objection in court, or whether it constituted a political question. The standing question seemed to me governed by a case clearly on point, Flast v. Cohen (1968). We asked the lawyers in the argument of that case—because there seemed to be a straight-forward legal question with no fact record to develop—if we should hold that there is standing, that the case is justiciable, can we get supplemental briefs and proceed to decide the merits? Both parties said, no, if you are going to hold that the case is justiciable, send it back to the district court because there are historical materials we would like to place in the record. So we were told by the parties that they did not want the court of appeals, at that stage, to decide the merits of the case. A panel on which I served—a divided panel, it was 2 to 1—held that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the case. There was a strong reaction. The House of Representatives adopted a resolution saying that the court had acted improperly, had encroached on the legislature's domain, had meddled in a matter covered by the House Rules. There was no nay vote in the House. Representative Conyers abstained; otherwise, the House was unanimous. That resolution was indeed a telling legislative reaction to a decision perceived as an improper judicial incursion on legislative turf. My court, the full court, vacated the three-judge panel decision, so it does not appear in the Federal Reporter. It was in the advance sheet, but the decision was vacated before the opinions could be put in the bound volume. You have the opinions before you, however, in the collection of my decisions. I recount that episode to indicate how sensitive these questions are, how 

YOU might ask the counsel to the Senate, who argued very effectively in a number of speech or debate clause178 cases before us, for a brief on that subject. That office would be best qualified to address the issue for a Senate audience.

Yes. 

Yes. 

Right. 

Senator, I don't have a satisfactory alternative. This is a very difficult area. I can say only that I am open to arguments, to ideas, but at this moment, as I said yesterday, I have no solution to offer. I do know that it is easy to criticize. It is not so easy to offer an alternative. 

Yes. I haven't had much establishment clause business 

Right, the Zion Coptic Church case. So you are right that I will have to think in a harder, more focused way, as I always do when I have a case to decide. 

And perhaps I should explain what that case involved. Leahy applied for a driver's license in the District of Columbia. As District driver's licenseholders know, the license number here coincides with—it is the same as—one's Social Security number. Leahy's religious belief involved a rejection of identification with a Social Security number. If he were to use that number to identify himself, he would very substantially reduce his chances for an after-life. That was his religious belief. The District said this is our system. Every driver must have a driver's license, and these are our numbers. But something else came out in that case. Because this city has many people who don't have Social Security numbers, diplomats, it did have another system of numbers it used for embassies. And Leahy's religious belief could have been accommodated by the city; at least we sent it back to determine why the city could not respect his religious belief— we said that in the interest of free exercise there had to be a compelling reason to require Leahy to choose between his faith and his driver's license. 

Yes, you are reading my opinion correctly. I was applying the test then effective, looking closely at such a restriction and requiring the State to come up with a compelling justification for not making an accommodation. The decision suggested in a footnote that perhaps there could be no compelling justification given this alternate system of license numbers the city had. But we remanded the case on that point. We said it wasn't enough to say every driver must have a driver's license and so either you get one that we provide or you don't drive. 

Senator Leahy, may I say first that the majority of the District of Columbia Circuit did not uphold that classification. What we did was vote to deny a rehearing en bane. The Air Force regulation was upheld by a three-judge panel. As I recall, the writing judge was a visiting judge, and two of my colleagues voted with him to uphold the military uniform regulation.

There was a divided decision in the Supreme Court upholding my court's decision that a uniform regulation has to be applied uniformly. That was the decision of the majority of the Supreme Court.Our Constitution is the Constitution for all of us. It is the most fundamental law for this body and for all of the people. The end of Capt. Simcha Goldman's case was that this body, Congress, passed a law that said the Air Force can accommodate to the yarmulke. By that action, this body was implementing the free exercise clause in an entirely proper way, in my judgment.

Yes, I think that is quite right. Our tradition has been one of many religions, one of tolerance and mutual respect.

In what context? We also have first amendment protection for that, and the right to petition the Government to redress our grievances. 

I think that is quite correct. It doesn't mean that you have the same rights of association in the military that you would have in civilian life. There are undoubtedly restrictions, if you are a member of the military, that control you, but your constitutional rights don't end. They are fitted to the setting in which you are placed. 

That there is some kind of speech that is more protected than other kinds, I think there is no question about that. One kind of speech that is entirely outside the first amendment under current doctrine is obscenity. Commercial speech doesn't get quite the same protection as core political speech. Various expressions fall somewhere in between, like indecent, but not obscene speech.75-974 0 - 9 4 — 7184 So if you are asking me the question, is there only one kind of speech and is all speech protected to the same extent, I think the case law is clear that, no, that isn't the case. 

We know that the most dangerous thing the Government can do is to try to censor speech on the basis of the viewpoint that is being expressed. We are uncomfortable with content regulation, generally, but particularly uncomfortable with attempts to certain statements of particular point of view. I might mention the military base case, the Spock (1976) case: The Court said it was all right for the military to say no political speech on the base. But suppose the question had been, we will allow Republican and Democratic Party speech, but not Labor Party speech. Now, that would have been a very troublesome thing for Government to be doing. It is one thing to ban the category, even though it is content-based regulation—no political speech. But if the Government were to say that we regard this speech as safe and that speech is unsafe, it would run up against the motivating force for the first amendment. Shortly after the Revolutionary War, there was a political cartoon that snowed a Tory being carted off, and the caption read: "Liberty of speech for those who speak the speech of Liberty." That is what we have to be on our guard against. The message of the first amendment is tolerance of speech, not the speech we agree with, but the speech we hate. 

There is a constitutional right to privacy composed of at least two distinguishable parts. One is the privacy expressed most vividly in the fourth amendment: The Government shall not break into my home or my office without a warrant, based on probable cause; the Government shall leave me alone. The other is the notion of personal autonomy. The Government shall not make my decisions for me. I shall make, as an individual, uncontrolled by my Government, basic decisions that affect my life's course. Yes, I think that what has been placed under the label privacy is a constitutional right that has those two elements, the right to be let alone and the right to make basic decisions about one's life's course. 

Yes. 

The Government must have a good reason, if it is going to intrude on one's privacy or autonomy. The fourth amendment expresses it well with respect to the privacy of one's home. The Government should respect the autonomy of the individual, unless there is reason tied to the community's health or safety. We live in communities and I must respect the health and wellbeing of others. So if I am not going to accord that respect on my own, the Government appropriately requires me to recognize that I live in a community with others and can't push my own decisionmaking to the point where it would intrude on the autonomy of others.186 

I do, Senator, and I thank you. 

With a break in between? 

I could also say that I believe Marbury v. Madison (1803) was rightly decided. I said already yesterday that Dred Scott (1857) was wrong the day it was issued. There was no justification for it.

Then I would also like to say that I prize the institution of judicial review for constitutionality. We have become a model for the world in that respect, and that is one of the reasons why I resist labels like "activism" and "restraint." I think it is a very precious institution that we have, and it should not be abused.After World War II, nations in other parts of the world that never had judicial review for constitutionality as part of their tradition adopted models compatible with their own systems but inspired by what our Supreme Court has been in our society. That role needs to be guarded; it should be exercised with great care.Now, the Washington University Law Quarterly article you mentioned was about the need for, or utility of an equal rights amendment. Why do we need an equal rights amendment when so many people have said the equal protection clause suffices? That was the topic of that article, was it not?

I don't know if my article in the Washington University Law Quarterly is here. I do recall the second circuit conference, and I do know that was a conference focused on the need for the utility of an equal rights amendment. I recall that that was a debate with Gloria Steinem and myself on one side and two gentlemen on the other side.The Washington University Law Quarterly article, which somebody is going to try to get for me, was part of a series in the Washington University in St. Louis on the topic of equality. My specific topic was gender discrimination. I think the title indicated that the article dealt with the equal protection clause and the equal rights amendment as safeguards of the fair and equal treatment of women in our society.

Right. That is 

Right, yes. The article contrasted having an Equal Rights Amendment as distinguished from the equal protection clause as a guarantee of the equal citizenship of women before the law. 

Yes. This article is, as I said, an article in a symposium on the quest for equality. There was one on race, one on equal employment opportunity, one devoted to sexual equality under the 14th amendment and the Equal Rights Amendment. That article, like the Second Circuit Judicial Conference talk, focused on two things: the equal protection clause as a guarantee of the equal citizenship of women versus the Equal Rights Amendment. That was the entire context of the article, and what I said there was this: It is part of our history—a sad part of our history, Senator Specter, but undeniably part of our history—that the 14th amendment, that great amendment that changed so much in this Nation, was not intended by its framers immediately to change the status of women. And it is part of history that the leading feminists of the day—Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott—campaigned against ratification of the 14th amendment because it allowed a system to persist in the United States where women couldn't vote, they couldn't hold office, if they married they couldn't hold property in their own name, they couldn't contract for themselves. That is what life was like for women in the middle of the 19th century. Times changed, and eventually, after nearly a century of struggle, women achieved the vote. They became full citizens. And many people thought that when women became full citizens, entitled to the vote, they had achieved equality. The vote should have qualified women as full and equal citizens with men, entitled to the same equal protection before the laws. The position was that, yes, it took bold and dynamic interpretation in view of what the framers of the 14th amendment intended. The framers of the 14th amendment meant no change, they intended no change at all in the status of women before the law. But in 1920, when women achieved the vote, they became full citizens, and you have to read the Constitution as a whole, changed, as Thurgood Marshall said, over the years by amendment and by judicial construction. So it was certainly a bold change from the middle of the 19th century until the 1970's when women's equal citizenship was recognized before the law.190 I remain an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment for this reason. I have a daughter and a granddaughter. I know what the history was. I would like the legislators of this country and of all the States to stand up and say we know what that history was in the 19th century; we want to make a clarion announcement that women and men are equal before the law, just as every modern human rights document in the world does, at least since 1970. I would like to see that statement made just that way in the U.S. Constitution. But that women are equal citizens and have been ever since the 19th amendment was passed, I think that is the case. And that is what the Washington University Law Quarterly article is about. That is what the second circuit debate was about. And I do not think my statements should be applied out of context. This was a precisely focused article about women's entitlement to equal citizenship before the law. 

Senator Specter, that technique is necessary and, as you know very well, has been used in situations like the Marathon (1982) case, where the Supreme Court upset the arrangement Congress thought it could make with respect to bankruptcy judges. It was used also in a case upsetting a jury system because it discriminated on the basis of sex, by leaving out women. I think it was a case from Alabama, it was White v. Crook (1966). The three-judge Federal district court said we obviously are not191 going to stop all trials. Instead, we are going to give the legislature until the next session to come up with a new plan for calling jurors so that women will not be excluded. In settings like that, where it takes more than just temporarily putting someone in, or temporarily putting someone out, your point is essential.I mentioned as the model for the decisions the Supreme Court made in this area Justice Harlan's opinion in Welsh. Justice Harlan didn't say, Mr. Welsh, you lose until Congress decides what it wants to do. I took the position I did as an advocate. It is a position nine Justices of the Supreme Court explicitly accepted in 1979. It is an area that is tightly cabined. It reaches only benefits conferred on one group, but denied to a similarly or identically situated other group.There is a denial of equal protection that the Court has unanimously decided must be dealt with one way or another. It is not like constructing a new system for bankruptcy judges. It is not like having the clerk gear up to call more people to serve on juries.I stand by the Supreme Court's unanimous decision on this point in Califano v. Westcott (1979), I ask you to read it, and I tell you that I go no less far and no further than the Court did in that case.

My own view on the death penalty I think is not relevant to any question I would be asked to decide as a judge. I will be scrupulous in applying the law on the basis of the Constitution, legislation, and precedent. As I said in my opening remarks, my own views and what I would do if I were sitting in the legislature are not relevant to the job for which you are considering me, which is the job of a judge. So I would not like to answer that question, any more than I would like to answer the question of what choice I would make for myself, what reproductive choice I would make for myself. It is not relevant to what I would decide as a judge.193 

Senator Specter, I tried to answer that question before. I will try once more. The 14th amendment says that no State shall deny, neither the United States nor any State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws. Before women were full citizens, before they could vote, maybe one could justify the lack of equal treatment. Ever since the 19th amendment, women are citizens of equal stature with men. The Equal Rights Amendment is a very important symbol, in my judgment, because it would explicitly correct the unfortunate history of the treatment of women as something less than full persons. However, the Constitution has been corrected by the 19th amendment to make women full citizens. I can't imagine anyone not reading the equal protection clause today to mean that women and men are persons of equal stature and dignity before the law. I don't think that is at all an activist position with regard to the proper interpretation of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. 

I think Martha Griffiths, when she first supported the Equal Rights Amendment in a big way in the House, said if the courts had properly construed the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, there would be no need for this Equal Rights Amendment. In fact, the first Commission on the Status of Women, which I think Eleanor Roosevelt headed, was not enthusiastic about the Equal Rights Amendment. The Commission said it was not needed, because the courts would come in time to recognize that decisions holding that the State need not allow women to practice law, the State need not put women on juries, that those decisions are just wrong, incompatible with the statement that no State shall deny to any person the equal protection of the laws. So the supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment, even when it passed Congress—Martha Griffiths and others—made the point that, if the courts had interpreted the equal protection clause to cover all of humanity, females as well as males, there would not have been a need for the amendment. As time went on, when the Burger Court began to move in this area, the need for the amendment lessened in the practical sense. It still is important, I believe, in the symbolic sense. As I said be-fore, every modern human rights document has a statement that men and women are equal before the law. Our Constitution doesn't. I would like to see, for the sake of my daughter and my granddaughter and all the daughters who come after, that statement as part of our fundamental instrument of Government.

That is exactly right, Mr. Chairman, and, on the legislature's part, it would have been a good way of keeping cases out of court, cases that should never have had to become Federal cases. 

You know the historic origin of the current absence of genuine protection. She, according to the common law, was under his wing and cover. 

The law assumed that he took good care of her. He was allowed to beat her, but only mildly. 

The independent counsel law was attacked on the ground that it was an improper derogation from the full authority of the executive branch; the defendant, in the case before my court, argued that prosecution belonged to the executive branch and that Congress had improperly curtailed the executive's role in choosing prosecutors.I featured in my dissent in that case two mainstays of our constitutional system: First, separation of powers, and second, tempering the first, checks and balances. Centrally at stake was the principle that no person should be judge of his or her own cause. The independent counsel law provided for the designation of a prosecutor for the highest executive officer, the President, and those who immediately surrounded that officer. The President and his people could not be judge of their own cause without sacrificing the appearance of detachment, and reducing the prospect for a thorough investigation.It would have been a very dangerous thing, a very different thing, if the legislature had said, President, you are disabled and we are going to be the prosecutors. The Founding Fathers worried most about legislative encroachment on other domains. But the legislature enacted a law that did not assign authority to Congress. The independent counsel law took away some, certainly not all, of the Executive's authority. The process starts with the Attorney General, whose responsibility it is to ask for the appointment of an independent counsel, and there were other safeguards.But the appointment authority was placed in the courts. The law did not present the kind of question that was involved in the challenge to the Gramm-Rudman Act. In that case, it was an officer allied with the legislature could be seen as encroaching on the Executive's domain. Independent counsel, however, were to be appointed by judges. In my view, the legislation responded to a grave concern on the checking side, and was constitutional on that account. I thought the law should have been upheld by my court, as it eventually was by the Supreme Court.

Yes, Brandeis said that even though Swift wasn't working as anticipated, and even though one couldn't justify retaining the precedent on the basis of reliance, he would hesitate to overrule. WTiat led him finally to do so was the recognition that the Federal courts were embarked on an unconstitutional course, and that was 

I don't think that reliance is absent from the criminal law field. Recall that precedent is set for the way the courts will behave, the way the police will behave, the way prosecutors will behave. One can't say that, in criminal law, reliance doesn't count. Adhering to precedent fosters the stability, the certainty, the clarity of the law; stare decisis across the board serves those purposes. We have distanced ourselves from the British practice which, until very recently, so solidly entrenched stare decisis that the House of Lords, the Law Lords, would not overrule any precedent. That rigidity became unworkable and the Law Lords today admit some leeway. But stare decisis is a firm principle of our law and important in all areas. 

Yes, I gave thought to it just the other night when C-SPAN was replaying a clip of an interview with me taped some years ago, and I was trying to explain appellate court procedure. And I used many words to convey the picture. One minute filmed in the courtroom, during the argument of an appeal, would have been so much clearer than my attempt to explain to an interviewer in chambers how we proceed in the courtroom. Yes, I did give thought to the matter. As you know, Senator Heflin, the Federal courts are just now embarked on an experiment on a volunteer basis. Some courts have volunteered, some district courts—trial courts—and some courts of appeals have volunteered to take part in televising proceedings. A report will be published evaluating the experiment. Based on that report, the U.S. Judicial Conference is going to come up with some proposals for the future.199 Some of the judges are apprehensive about who will control the editing of videotapes, because one can take a snippet out of context and give the public a false or distorted impression of what goes on. 

This is an area where style and substance tend to meet. It helps in building collegiality if you don't take zealous positions, if you don't write in a overwrought way, if you state your position logically and without undue passion for whatever is the position you are developing. Think of this way: Suppose one colleague drafts an opinion and another is of a different view. That other says, "Here's what I think, perhaps you can incorporate my ideas in your opinion, then we can come together in a single opinion for the court; otherwise, consider this a statement I am thinking about making for myself." That is one way of inviting or encouraging accommodation. Another way is to ask, "Is this conflict really necessary?" Perhaps there is a ground, maybe a procedural ground, on which everyone can agree, so that the decision can be unanimous, saving the larger question for another day. Willingness to entertain the position of the other person, readiness to rethink one's own views, are important attitudes on a collegial court. If your colleagues, who are intelligent people and deserve respect, have a different view, perhaps you should then pause and rethink, Am I right? Is there a way that we can come together? Is this a case where it really doesn't matter so much which way the law goes as long as it is clear? Now, with one of the people sitting behind me, I am hesitant to say this, but let's say a tax provision is at issue. And I think Congress meant x, while my colleague thinks Congress meant y. But either one will do for the purposes of getting on with the world. 

In such a case, I might then say I am going to squelch my view of how the Internal Revenue Code subsection should be interpreted and go along with my colleague. 

Yes, Senator Heflin. I understand the problem. It is easier to talk among three than it is among nine. I had a lesson in my own circuit. When we confer after a case is argued, we have a conference before the judges exchanged written memorandums. We have an immediate, oral conference. I understand that the practice in the Second Circuit—I came from New York—was once different. Judges there, at least in the 1970's, exchanged written memorandums before coming together to decide the case. AndI considered that way better. If you had to put pencil to paper, you had to think about the case, get your ideas together.But my colleagues' view was different. It was that, just as you said, if you put something on a circulated paper, you have kind of committed yourself to it. It becomes a little harder to shake loose from what you wrote, to retreat, than if the first discussion of the case, the first encounter, is just in conversation. It is easier to back off and to modify your position.

Well, one thing is information, and it depends whether we are talking about the business community or individuals. From time to time, I receive from various law firms in town newsletters describing the latest developments in labor law or ERISA law, for example. Such law firms endeavor to keep their clients informed about new developments in the law.In other areas, the flow of information is less satisfactory. We talked about Stephen Wiesenfeld's case involving the mother's benefit which became a parent benefit. When Wiesenfeld's case was reported in the press, I received many letters, not simply from fathers but from mothers, who didn't know that benefit was available. The Social Security Administration has tried to increase the availability of knowledge of what the law is—not only what the law requires of you, but the benefits the law provides for you.Nowadays at funeral homes, at banks, information is accessible about benefits available on death. But I was disconcerted about the number of people who didn't know and, therefore, missed out on benefits because the limitation period for filing had passed.We now have modern means of communication to spread information. Public service announcements on TV can be useful in that way. All involved with the law—government officers and private persons—should attempt to find solutions to the problem of individuals not knowing what the law is, what the law requires of them, and the benefits provided for them.

I can't answer that question in the abstract. If it were to come before Court in the guise of a specific case where a party said the law is exposing me to a penalty, it is unfair, unjust, it violates due process, I would have the concrete context and the legal arguments that would be made on one side or the other. But, again, I would like to emphasize that this Constitution is the Constitution for the Congress of the United States, and before any law is passed, every legislator should be satisfied that, in his or her judgment, the law that has been proposed is compatible with con-stitutional limitations. The Constitution is our fundamental instrument of government, and it is addressed to this body before it is addressed to the courts. We get it only when a citizen or person complains that Congress has, in effect, violated the highest law.

And not simply in the way of laws. Think of what this body puts out, think of the massive regulations put out by the agencies. Even at the court level, each year the courts produce more volumes of the Federal Reporter than they did the year before. There was a day—when I was in law school and, later, when I was a law clerk—when I skimmed all the Federal advance sheets, the F.Supp.'s and the F.2d's. That would be impossible for me to do nowadays. I can just about manage U.S. Law Week each week.Yes, we continue to make more and more law, both in the legislatures and the courts, and the agencies produce more than both of those put together.

I will be glad to try, Senator. May I say first that it has never in my mind been an either/or choice, never one rather than the other; it has been both. I will try to explain how my own thinking developed on this issue. It relates to a case involving a woman's choice for birth rather than the termination of her pregnancy. It is one of the briefs that you have. It is the case of Captain Susan Struck v. Secretary of Defense (1972). This was Capt. Susan Struck's story.She became pregnant while she was serving in the Air Force in Vietnam. That was in the early 1970's. She was offered a choice. She was told she could have an abortion at the base hospital—and let us remember that in the early 1970's, before Roe v. Wade (1973), abortion was available on service bases in this country to members of the service or, more often, dependents of members of the service.206 Capt. Susan Struck said: I do not want an abortion. I want to bear this child. It is part of my religious faith that I do so. However, I will use only my accumulated leave time for the childbirth. I will surrender the child for adoption at birth. I want to remain in the Air Force. That is my career choice. She was told that that was not an option open to her if she wished to remain in the Air Force. In Captain Struck's case, we argued three things: First, that the applicable Air Force regulations—if you are pregnant you are out unless you have an abortion—violated the equal protection principle, for no man was ordered out of service because he had been the partner in a conception, no man was ordered out of service because he was about to become a father. Next, then we said that the Government is impeding, without cause, a woman's choice whether to bear or not to bear a child. Birth was Captain Struck's personal choice, and the interference with it was a violation of her liberty, her freedom to choose, guaranteed by the due process clause. Finally, we said the Air Force was involved in an unnecessary interference with Captain Struck's religious belief. So all three strands were involved in Captain Struck's case. The main emphasis was on her equality as a woman vis-a-vis a man who was equally responsible for the conception, and on her personal choice, which the Government said she could not have unless she gave up her career in the service. In that case, all three strands were involved: her equality right, her right to decide for herself whether she was going to bear the child, and her religious belief. So it was never an either/or matter, one rather than the other. It was always recognition that one thing that conspicuously distinguishes women from men is that only women become pregnant; and if you subject a woman to disadvantageous treatment on the basis of her pregnant status, which was what was happening to Captain Struck, you would be denying her equal treatment under the law. Now, that argument—that discrimination, disadvantageous treatment because of pregnancy is indeed sex discrimination—was something the Supreme Court might have heard in the Struck case, but the Air Force decided to waive her discharge. Although the Air Force had won in the trial court and won in the court of appeals, the Supreme Court had granted certiorari on Captain Struck's petition. At that point, perhaps with the advice of the Solicitor General, the Air Force decided it would rather switch than fight, and Captain Struck's discharge was waived. So she remained in the service, and the Court never heard her case. In the case the Court eventually got, one less sympathetic on the facts, the majority held that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy was not discrimination on the basis of sex. Then this body, the Congress, in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, indicated that it thought otherwise. The Struck brief, which involved a woman's choice for birth, marks the time when I first thought long and hard about this question. At no time did I regard it as an either/or, one pocket or the other, issue. But I did think about it, first and foremost, as differential treatment of the woman, based on her sex.

It is essential to woman's equality with man that she be the decisionmaker, that her choice be controlling. If you impose restraints that impede her choice, you are disadvantaging her because of her sex.208 Consider in this connection the line of cases about procreation. The importance to an individual of the choice whether to beget or bear a child has been recognized at least since Skinner v. Oklahoma (1992). That case involved a State law commanding sterilization for certain recidivists. Sterilization of a man was at issue in Skinner, but the importance of procreation to an individual's autonomy and dignity was appreciated, and that concern applies to men as well as women. Abortion prohibition by the State, however, controls women and denies them full autonomy and full equality with men. That was the idea I tried to express in the lecture to which you referred. The two strands—equality and autonomy—both figure in the full portrayal. Recall that Roe was decided in early days. Roe was not preceded by a string of women's rights cases. Only Reed v. Reed (1971) had been decided at the time of Roe. Understanding increased over the years. What seemed initially, as much a doctor's right to freely exercise his profession as a woman's right, has come to be understood more as a matter in which the woman is central. 

Yes. 

The 10th amendment addresses the powers not delegated to the United States and says they are reserved to the States. The 10th amendment deals with the rights reserved to the States. The ninth amendment—and you have recited the history— speaks of the people. There was a concern, as you said, that if we had a Bill of Rights, some rights would surely be left out. Therefore, it was better, some thought, just to rely on the fact that the Federal Government was to be a government of enumerated, delegated powers, and leave it at that. The ninth amendment is part of the idea that people have rights. The Bill of Rights keeps the Government from intruding on those rights. We don't have a complete enumeration in the first 10 amendments, and the ninth amendment so confirms. 

It doesn't mean the States. That's the 10th amendment, yes. 

Yes, I agree entirely. I think Dred Scott (1857), by the way, was a tragic decision, a wrong decision. I don't think it was such a popular decision with a good part of the country that didn't believe a person who was in a place where he could be free could be returned to a state of bondage. I don't believe that Dred Scott was a popular decision throughout the United States.Senator SlMON. It was divided opinion, but probably if polls had been taken at the time, it would have been a popular decision.Judge GINSBURG. Korematsu (1944) was indeed a tragic decision. One of the dissenting Justices called it legalized racism. That might have a euphemism for what we now recognize that case represents. Americans of German ancestry and Americans of Italian ancestry were not treated that way.

That was certainly the position Justice Murphy took. As you know, Justice Black wrote the opinion for the Court.

His opinion upheld the racial classification. 

I think that is an accurate description. It is also accurate to say I appreciate that the United States is a country of many religions. We have a pluralistic society, and that is characteristic of the United States. 

I wish it did. It 

It was the majority opinion of Congress. 

Captain Goldman had been in service for many years, and one day the base commander said, "You're out of uniform," because he was wearing a yarmulke, which was his religious observance. The failure of the service to accommodate to that deviation from the uniform regulation was made the basis of a case that came before my court. It came before a three-judge panel. I was not on that panel.213 The panel unanimously ruled that uniform regulations are, by their very nature, arbitrary and that the courts were not to secondguess the military in this decision. There was then a petition to rehear the case en bane. I voted to rehear the case en bane. Three people did, but the majority voted against rehearing the case. I did not write a full opinion in the Simcha Goldman (1986) case. I wrote a statement saying the case should be reheard by the full court. I said the full court should not embrace the argument that a uniform is a uniform, so there could be no deviation. The case, I thought, was worth fuller attention. 

But he was a man of a different age. He had been brought up not to relate to women in that kind of setting. I have told the story many times of sitting in the back of the car when my judge drove Judge Learned Hand home. That great man would say, en route home, anything that came into his mind. He would sing songs with words I didn't even know. I once said to him, "How can you carry on this way with me in the car and yet not consider me to be your law clerk?" And he said words to this effect: "Young lady, I am not looking you in the face." Those were ancient days. There was no title VII, people were up front about feeling uncomfortable dealing with women, and that was that. 

Yes, he was, and his decision in the Masses (1917) case was one of the bright lights in what we see now as a very unhappy episode in the history of this country—the postWorld War II days of the Red scare. 

I will stay away from the living. Senator SlMON. All right. [Laughter.] Judge GINSBURG. We are just now doing a history of our Court, a circuit history. A question came up about talking to law clerks for this history. We drew a line with the living. We said to the author, you may talk to the law clerks about the judges who can't complain about it anymore, but not clerks who served the living, at least not without the judge's permission. 

I would also like to restrict my response to this century. That will make it easier, because if I didn't I would have to include Chief Justice John Marshall; he helped make us one Nation, indivisible. If we go on to liberty and justice for all, I would put together two people who spoke originally in dissent but whose position on the first amendment is well accepted today, Brandeis and Holmes. I would like to include Cardozo, but as you know, his career was principally on the New York Court of Appeals. He was known for his common law judging, and less known for constitutional adjudication. He served only 6 years on the Supreme Court. I would add to the list Justice Harlan because, as I explained before, of the judges in my time, there is no one—whether you agree with him or disagree with him—who was more honest in telling you the grounds of his decision, the competing interests, and why he came out the way he did. I spoke of his total honesty in my discussion of the conscientious objector case.So if I could take those three and put them together, that would be some Justice, wouldn't it?Senator SlMON. It would be. And I would like to add Learned Hand to that list, if I could, aside from thatJudge GlNSBURG. Yes; I thought we were limiting it to Supreme Court Justices, but certainly yes. I would like to put Henry Friendly there, too.Senator SlMON. You have been a champion of the cause of women and civil liberties for women, and Senator Grassley earlier mentioned that in our laws we have finally included Congress which has set up its own provisions for enforcement of antidiscrimination. There are problems, and under the separation of powers I think it is proper for Congress to set up its own.I serve on the Subcommittee on Disabilities, and my colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, has written me a letter, and let me just read two paragraphs from that letter. And I would like to enter the full letter in the record, Mr. Chairman.It says:Unfortunately, no Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability or, for that matter, race, gender, religion, or national origin by our Federal courts. It is my understanding that our Federal district and appellate courts have developed model policies regarding complaints of discrimination by applicants and employees. However, these policies do not specify the standards that must be used to determine whether discrimination has occurred, do not specify what remedies are available, assuming discrimination has been found, and do not include the right to appeal to the courts. Furthermore, there are no policies governing nondiscrimination with respect to access by the general public.With respect to the Supreme Court, it is my understanding that there are no written policies or procedures whatsoever prohibiting discrimination in employment and in access to Supreme Court proceedings and for remedying discrimination.[The letter of Senator Harkin follows:]U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON LABOR AND HUMAN RESOURCES,Washington, DC, July 14, 1993.Hon. PAUL SIMON,U.S. Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. DEAR PAUL: Over the years, we have worked together to broaden the civil rightsand expand opportunities for individuals with disabilities. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (which, among other things, prohibits discrimination by Federal agencies in the conduct of their business) and the Americans with Disabilities Act are two of the most important pieces of legislation impacting on the lives of people with disabilities.Unfortunately, no Federal law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability (or for that matter race, gender, religion, or national origin) by our Federal courts. It is my understanding that our Federal district and appellate courts have developed model policies regarding complaints of discrimination by applicants and employees. However, these policies: do not specify the standards that must be used to determine whether discrimination has occurred; do not specify what remedies are available assuming discrimination has been found; and do not include the right to appeal to the courts. Furthermore, there are no policies governing nondiscrimination with respect to access by the general public.With respect to the Supreme Court, it is my understanding that there are no written policies or procedures whatsoever prohibiting discrimination in employment and access to Supreme Court proceedings and for remedying discrimination.I request that when Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg comes before the Judiciary Committee next week regarding her nomination to serve as an associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, you inform her about this situation and ask her what she will do to address it, if confirmed by the Senate.Sincerely, TOM HARKIN, U.S. Senator.75-974 0 - 9 4 — 8

I don't know what the Supreme Court regulations are. I do know that the Supreme Court in many respects has been treated differently by Congress. For example, I participated in the decision of a case involving picketing at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was not covered by the law that covered the rest of the Federal courts. The case was called Grace v. Burger (1985).The decision, both in our court and the Supreme Court, upheld the first amendment claim of a woman who was standing, if I remember correctly, on the sidewalk in front of the Court carrying a sign that had the words of the first amendment written on it. She was removed for doing that.I can't speak about what the Supreme Court's own rules are now. But, as you have said, Congress has accepted fair employment practices standards for itself. I hope, if we meet 6 months from now, I will be informed on the subject of your inquiry and can give you an enlightened answer.Senator SlMON. And it does seem to me that not only the Supreme Court, but the lower courts ought to have some process by which, if a person feels that he or she has been aggrieved, that he or she can go to someone and know that there is some process established, some procedures established at all court levels. I will write to you, if my staff reminds me, 6 months from now.

Yes, Senator, I have and I know just what you mean. You can even see the difference between the Federal courton which I serve and the courts across the street. The U.S. Courthouse tends to be a rather quiet, empty place. If you go across the street to the District of Columbia Superior Court, you will see a great mass of people—all kinds of legal business, all kinds of problems, including heart-rending family problems. The place is teeming; it is quite a contrast to the quieter halls of the Federal court.One of the things that I have done every other year with my law clerks, more often, if they are so inclined, is to visit the local jail and Lorton Penitentiary, which is the nearest penitentiary. We visited St. Elizabeth's, the facility for the criminally insane, when it was a Federal facility. Now it is a District facility, so we haven't gone there in the past few years.I do that to expose myself to those conditions, and also for my law clerks. Most of them will go on to practice in large law firms specializing in corporate business, and won't see the law as it affects most people. That is one of the things I do to stay in touch.Senator SlMON. I would simply commend that practice, first of all. And as you prepare to take that oath and when you get together with your family—your son from Illinois, particularly—I hope that you in some way plan to continue that kind of an exposure. I think it is important. I think it is important for the members of the U.S. Senate. I think it is important for Supreme Court Justices.Judge GINSBURG. It took me a long time to arrange for a tour at Alderson, which is one of the nearest women's Federal facilities. That was also instructive and moving for me.Senator SlMON. There are people who will have to assist you in that, because of the nature of your new position, but I think it is something that is a desirable thing.In the case of O'Donnell ConstructionCo. v. District ofColumbia, you voted against a set-aside, and that was done, as I understand it, on the basis of the Croson decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. The Croson decision has resulted in significant damage to opportunities for a lot of minorities and women in the field of business. We have come a long way in providing opportunities, but we still have a long way to go, as you know.I had my staff dig out something from one of my books. Abraham Lincoln, incidentally, as a State legislator in 1832, came out for the women's right to vote almost a century before that happened nationally. But when he was in the legislature, one of the bills passed, fairly typical, was the act for the Wabash and Mississippi Railroad which included this provision:In case any married woman, infant, idiot or insane person shall be interested in any such land or real state, the circuit court or justice of the peace shall appoint some competent and suitable person to act for and in behalf of such married woman, infant, insane person or idiot.We have made progress, but we still have progress to make. I was interested in your decision in the O'Donnell case, whether that is solely based on response to the Supreme Court, or is there a philosophical base to your decision also?Judge GINSBURG. I concurred in a decision that was written for a unanimous panel. I think the author was Judge Randolph. Our decision was controlled by Croson (1989). The District's plan measured up even less than the Richmond plan did in Crosonitself. As218 you know, under current law, a different standard applies to Federal plans; it is a more tolerant standard than the one that applies to city plans like the Richmond plan.Crosongoverns city plans, and MetropolitanBroadcasting (1990) governs Federal plans. There is certainly a role for Congress to play in this.My concurring statement said Croson controls this case. I also recalled, in that separate statement, the position Justice Powell had taken in the Bakke (1978) case. He said that you could have a reason for an affirmative action program, for example, Harvard's preferential admissions program, that was not tied explicitly to proven past discrimination. But the O'Donnell (1992) case in our court did not fit that mold. It was a case totally controlled by the Croson precedent.Senator SlMON. The second part of my question is, Do you have a philosophical disagreement with the idea of set-asides?Judge GlNSBURG. I tried to express my view yesterday that, in many of these cases, there really is underlying discrimination. But it's not so easy to prove. Sometimes it would be better for society if we didn't push people to the wall and make them say, yes, I was a discriminator. The kind of settlement reflected in many affirmative action plans seems a better, healthier course for society than one that turns every case into a fierce, adversary contest that becomes costly and bitter.In many of these plans, there is a suspicion that underlying discrimination existed on the part of the employer and, sometimes, on the part of the unions involved. But, in place of a knock-down-dragout fight, it might be better to pursue voluntary action, always taking into account that there is a countervailing interest, as there was in the O'Donnell case. Members of the once preferred class understandably ask, "why me," why should I be the one made to pay? I didn't engage in past discrimination. That's why these cases must be approached with understanding and with care.I hope that is an adequate answer to your question. Senator SlMON. Really candidly, it wasn't all I was hoping for, but I am getting your response and I appreciate that. My time is up, and I thank you very much, Judge. Judge GlNSBURG. Thank you, Senator. 

I have yet to see the case where the Court has nothing to guide it, where there is that kind of blank. There is always the text that we are interpreting. The text comes in a certain setting. There is in this day and age an abundance of case law and commentary.I have not seen a case where the Court totally lacks way pavers. 

Yes; that means the precise case hasn't been decided by the Court. But there are, almost always analogies. I have not seen a case without analogies. And there are often choices to be made. I described one when I spoke of Wright v. Regan (1981), where there were two lines of precedent; the case, the particular case, could have been placed in either category. We placed it in one category. The Supreme Court said we were wrong; it belonged in the other. There are those kinds of choices. But I think every judge in this system is committed to the health and welfare of the Federal courts. When one compares to other systems what we have and the high position of our Supreme Court—a position unique in the world—the value of our system becomes clear, and we want to keep the system safe.

Yes. 

It would be wonderful, Senator, if you wrote the laws so clearly that we knew what your intent was immediately on reading them. Our job is to interpret the laws as the legislature meant them to be interpreted. Best of all possible worlds for us would be that you speak clearly, you leave no doubt, and we can just read the text and say no reasonable person can disagree about its meaning.But very often, my colleagues will look at a text, and one reasonable mind will say it means x while another reasonable mind will say it means y. We must then look someplace else.In such cases, I turn to the legislative history. I do so with an attitude I can best describe as hopeful skepticism. Hopeful because I really hope I will find something genuinely helpful there and that everything will be on line, the committee report and any other statements made. It would be grand if they all coincide.

Not rigidly. I can say as a general rule, if you have a unanimous committee report, that is going to be more useful, more reliable, than a statement made by a member of the chamber after the bill has passed. The statement of a single legislator generally would count for less.But I can't give you a definitive account and say it is always the committee report or it is always the statement of the sponsor that comes first. A very fine judge of my court, Judge Harold Leventhal, once said that visiting legislative history is like going to a cocktail party and looking through the crowd for your friends. There are some very recent situations in which the legislative history is so crammed that a statement saying the law means one thing can be matched by a statement saying it means something else.So, yes, one must decide the case. A judge must decide what the legislature mean. If she can't tell from the words of the statute, she must resort to our sources of help. Sometimes a judge can reason by analogy. Perhaps a similar statute was passed that has a clearer statement either in the text or the history of that statute. But, yes, I do look at legislative history when the text is not clear, and I approach it with an attitude of hopeful skepticism.

I am well aware of his position. 

Yes, I do, that was the sleeping in the park case. 

"Sleepless in Seattle." 

I did, yes. [Laughter.] I don't get to see many movies, but I did get to see that one. 

I did, especially the music. 

That conduct 

Can you give me an example? 

Then you are tipping me off that I shouldn't [Laughter.] You are starting me down the slope and I shouldn't put on the skis. 

Yes. 

The facilitative aspect of it is not entitled to the same protection as the expressive aspect of it. My comment in relation to my colleague's opinion is that one cannot draw a line between words and expression as he did, and say neatly, when you speak, that is speech, and otherwise it is conduct. I gave, as an example, this illustration: It is said that during World War II the King of Denmark stepped out on the street in Copenhagen wearing a yellow armband. If so, that gesture expressed the idea more forcefully than words could. 

I can say one thing about Justice Scalia: He is one of the few people in the world who can make me laugh, and I appreciate him for that. On legislative intent, I think I answered the question earlier. We have had on our court interesting colloquies about the difference in our attitude toward legislative history. Wherever I am and wherever he is, I think we will continue to have that interesting difference of view on the appropriateness of seeking help from legislative history. 

I don't on the question whether conduct is expression. 

Senator, I have not asked you to overlook, nor have I apologized for, anything I have done. Some of the best work I have done is reflected in my briefs. But I am a judge, not an advocate.I am reminded of the story that Judge Constance Baker Motley tells. She was once asked to recuse herself from a title VII case, because it was a sex discrimination case and she was a woman, so surely she should not sit on the case. She reminded the lawyer who made that application that there are only two choices, either you are a man or you are a woman. She said she would decide that case fairly and no one should think she is disqualified.Of course, the role of a judge is different from the role of an advocate. An advocate makes the very best case she can for her cli-229 ent. A judge judges impartially. A judge at my level takes what is put on her plate. We don't have a choice.You are right in pointing out that the Supreme Court's jurisdiction is discretionary, and the obligation of those judges is to take the cases that most need a national solution. The Court doesn't sit there to take the easy cases. You don't need a Supreme Court for the easy cases. The Justices must look at what issues need to be decided most for the Nation, and that's the basis on which the judges make their decisions about what to take.I can't answer any more precisely than that, but I think one of the reasons the Supreme Court was eager and urged Congress to remove the mandatory jurisdiction was that the Court then could take the cases that most needed a national solution.

You listed a number of the ones that would be on the top of anyone's list. But the Court doesn't deal with problems at large—crime or violence in our society. What comes to the Court is a particular case raising an issue in a particular context; unlike legislators, courts don't entertain general issues. They resolve concrete cases.The Court also considers timing. Sometimes the Court believes it will be able to judge better, if it has more returns from the other Federal courts. That is, perhaps the first time an issue is presented, the Court shouldn't take the case. Perhaps the Court would benefit from the views of several judges on the question. If all of the judges who have heard the matter are in agreement, the Court might decide that it need not take up the issue.If there is a division among lower court judges, then there may be a greater need for Supreme Court disposition. The idea is sometimes called percolation—having an issue aired in the lower courts for a time, having commentators speak to it, so that when the Court ultimately judges the case, it will be better informed to make the decision. In some areas, that is a wise thing to do.One of the cases in which I participated—a decision the Supreme Court reversed—might serve as an example. The case involved the fourth amendment. The Supreme Court had decided that if police officers stop a car, open the trunk and find a suitcase in it, they can't open the suitcase without a warrant.Cases then trooped before the lower courts involving other containers in cars—cardboard boxes and plastic bags, for example.Lower courts began to draw a "luggage line"; some applied a "worthy container" doctrine to determine when police officers needed a warrant. One was needed for a leather suitcase, for sure; lower courts were not so sure about lesser containers.My court, in that time of uncertainty, got the case of a leather pouch and a paper bag, side-by-side in a car trunk. The three-judge panel held that the police needed a warrant before they could open the leather pouch, but didn't need a warrant to open the paper bag, because it was a flimsy, unworthy container.I wrote an opinion for the full court saying we have now seen an array of container cases, going from the leather suitcase to the lowly paper bag, and we can't expect police officers to make worthy container judgments on the spot. Either you can open a container or you can't without a warrant. Because the Supreme Court had held that police officers could not open a suitcase without a warrant, my court held police could not open any closed container without a warrant.The Supreme Court said you have persuaded us that police officers should not be expected to draw luggage lines on the spot, but you are wrong about the ultimate solution. Once police officers have reason to stop a car, they can open the trunk and inspect anything in it without a warrant. That was a situation in which it was at first thought that police, and then courts, could distinguish between containers on the basis of their character. By the time the issue got to the Supreme Court, the Court saw that a "worthy container" rule would not work.The Court might not have seen that in the very first case. It took a string of cases in the lower courts—there really were cardboard box and plastic bag cases—all kinds of container cases. So that is an example of percolation. The Supreme Court was better informed, I think, in making the ultimate decision because the issue had been considered in the circuits for some years and the Court could take the variety of lower Court opinions into account when it made its final decision.

I can tell you the two books I most recently read. I don't know that these are representative, but most recently I read "Wordstruck" by Robert McNeil, and Marian Wright Edelman's book, dedicated to her children, 'The Measure of Our Success." I haven't been doing heavy reading in these last 5 weeks apart from reviewing over 700 of my opinions, to recall what I said in them, and refreshing my recollection of various areas of Federal law. My husband is a voracious reader. He often selects books for me. He knows what I would enjoy. Every once in a while, I choose something for myself, like 'The Bean Tree," which I recently read and enjoyed. But when my husband reads a book he knows I would particularly like, he says, "Read this one," like "Love in the Time of Cholera," which I adored. 

I probably read more fiction because I deal every day with so much nonfiction. 

The differences I think are obvious. I surely do not have his athletic prowess. [Laughter.] He is very tall, and I am rather small. I have tremendous admiration for him. I hope I am like him in dedication to the job and readiness to work hard at it. I can tell you that he has been so grand and thoughtful. He called me the day of the nomination, and called me at least twice while cleaning up—he is moving his chambers—to ask me whether I would like him to save for me this or that document, items he thinks would be particularly useful for a new Justice. He has already sent me some pages with the advice, "Don't read this now, but read it a month from now." He is a very caring, wonderful person. I would like to say something about Justice White that few people appreciate. It has been said many times here that I argued six cases in the Supreme Court and prevailed in five. If it had been up to Justice White, I would have prevailed in all six because he voted for me every time. He was the only one who did, although I am happy to say that Justices Brennan and Marshall came close in that one case the Court decided against my client. So I feel a particularly strong affinity to Justice White. 

This question, too, raises policy matter that calls for a judgment by the legislature. Judges would be obliged to apply whatever law Congress enacts, but I am not equipped to comment on a policy question that is so clearly committed to the legislative branch.

Again, all I can say is that Congress has full power over Indian affairs, and the Federal courts will follow the policy Congress sets in this area.

In Morton v. Moncari (1974), it was argued that the category "Indian" was a racial classification. The Court held that, given the history of our country, the category "Indian" was not racial but political.

That case is a precedent that may require interpretation in cases that will arise in the future. It would not be proper for me to comment on how that precedent will be interpreted in the next case, when the next case may be before a court on which I serve.

Senator, I feel obliged to give the same response to that question. It calls for interpretation of a precedent likely to figure in a future case.

The Indian Gaming Act is a new and much litigated law. Cases concerning that legislation may well come before me, so at this time I am not in a position to comment on it.

Senator, Sioux Nation (1980) is a well-known and very significant case. As you mentioned, it resulted in one of the largest judgments for an Indian tribe in the history of our country, and it righted what many people considered to be a veryold and a very grave historical wrong. Also, it set down some clear guideline for handling Indian just compensation claims. It brought some clarity to an area that was notably murky.With regard to the current situation—the distribution of the proceeds—that is a matter that may very well be back in the lap of the Court, so I can't comment on that part of it.

Now that I have the case, I will certainly read it and refresh my recollection.

I recall that a lawyer once asked me, "But, Judge Ginsburg, in the such-and-such case in which you concurred, footnote 83"—and it really was footnote 83—"said * * *. Are you backing away from footnote 83?" At that moment I decided that I don't concur in footnotes, especially when they get up over 50. [Laughter.] 

Senator Feinstein, I can say on the second amendment only what I said earlier. The Court has held that it is not incorporated in the 14th amendment; it does not apply to the States. What it means is a controversial question. The last time theSupreme Court spoke to the issue was in 1939. You summarized that decision, and you also summarized the state of law in the lower courts. The matter may well be before the Court again. All I can do is to acknowledge what I understand to be the current case law, that the second amendment is not binding on the States. Given my current situation, it would be inappropriate for me to say anything more than that. I would have to consider, as I have said many times today, the specific case, the record, briefs, and arguments presented. It would be injudicious for me to say anything more than that with respect to the second amendment.

I wish I could, Senator, but all I can tell you is that this is an amendment that has not been looked at by the Supreme Court since 1939. And apart from the specific context, I really can't expound on it. It is an area in which my court has had no business, and one with which I had no acquaintance as a law teacher. So I am not equipped to enlarge my response. If the Court takes a case involving the second amendment, I would proceed with the care that I give to any serious constitutional question. 

What I would say is that the two decisions are in tension, not in contention, because to some extent they overlap. These are decisions that are rather dense. I mean this—there are numerous opinions, and it is difficult to work through them all. The one thing I do sense is that this is a matter likely to come up again, so I believe it would be inappropriate for me to say anything more than what I have already acknowledged. There was no majority opinion in the Casey (1992) case. I think that is about what I can say.

That's a large part of it, yes. 

Yes. 

Senator, I can't comment on the Shaw (1993) case because, as I said, it is unfinished and it may be back in the Court again. And I would have to see the record, briefs, and arguments made in that very case. I can't prejudge what is going to be the next round in it. I am obliged to give the same answer I have given when that kind of question has been asked before about a case that is still alive, one that can be back before the Court.

I can't speak to this specific case because I am not familiar with the record. The Department of Justice is going to have to study this case and prepare whatever its position is going to be for future cases. But I can repeat what I said before, that a judge should not tear down without having a better building to replace what is in place, and that is a general rule to which most judges would subscribe. I can't say that is true of most law professors, but it certainly is true of most judges.I wish I could speak at a more specific level, but I really can't without having before me the precise record on which I could make an informed judgment.

Thank you.

I think rank discrimination against anyone is against the tradition of the United States and is to be deplored. Rank discrimination is not part of our Nation's culture. Tolerance is, and a generous respect for differences. This country is great because of its accommodation of diversity.The first thing I noticed when I came back to the United States from a prolonged stay in Sweden—and after I was so accustomed to looking at people whose complexion was the same—was the diversity. I took my first ride in several months on a New York subway, and I thought, what a wonderful country we live in; people who are so different in so many ways and yet, for the most part, we get along with each other. The richness of the diversity of this country is a treasure, and it is a constant challenge, too, a challenge to remain tolerant and respectful of one another.

Senator Hatch, I spoke earlier about the CSPAN interview with me. I thought how unfortunate it was that the audience couldn't view, because we didn't allow it at the time, television of the proceeding itself.

I don't see any problem with having appellate proceedings fully televised. I think it would be good for the public. 

We have open hearings. If coverage is gavel-togavel, I see no problem at all televising proceedings in an appellate court. Some concern has been expressed about televising trials, but we have come a long way from the days of the Sheppard (1966) case when the camera was very intrusive and there was all kinds of equipment in the courtroom that could be distracting. The concern currently is about distortion if editing is not controlled. 

Yes. 

Yes. But I would be very respectful of the views of my colleagues. 

Not at all, Senator Hatch. What I did have a strong objection to was the sex classification.

I think child abuse is a deplorable thing, whether it is same sex, opposite sex, male-female, and the State has to draw lines based on age. What I do object to is the vision of the world that supposes a woman is always the victim. So my only objection to that policy was its sex specificity. 

Yes, and I think that as much as we would not like these things to go on, children are abused, it is among the most deplorable things, and it doesn't

Yes, and has power to draw lines on the basis of age that are inevitably going to be arbitrary at the edge. 

Senator Hatch, let me say first that I appreciate your sensitivity to my position and the line that I have tried to draw. 

Let me try to answer your question this way. 

At least since 1972 and, if you date it from Furman, even earlier, the Supreme Court, by large majorities, has rejected the position that the death penalty under any and all circumstances is unconstitutional. I recognize that no judge on the Court currently takes the position that the death penalty is unconstitutional under any and all circumstances. All of the Justices on the Court have rejected that view. Many questions left unresolved. They are coming constantly before the Court. At least two are before the Court next year. I can tell you that I do not have a closed mind on this subject. I don't think it would be consistent with the line I have tried to hold to tell you that I will definitely accept or definitely reject any position. I can tell you that I am well aware of the precedent, and I have already expressed my views on the value of precedent.

I may get myself into difficulty with the Senators from tobacco States, and I am a reformed sinner in that respect myself. But this is a question of safety and health. I think the Government can fund antismoking campaigns and is not required equally to fund people who want to put their health and the health of others at risk. So my answer to that question is "yes," the Government can fund stop smoking campaigns and it doesn't have to fund smoking is intoxicating and fun campaigns. Yes, the Government can fund programs for the safety and health of the community.

I agree that those cases are the Supreme Court's precedent. I have no agenda to displace them, and that is about all I can say. I did express my views on the policy at stake, but the people have not elected me to vote on that policy.

I think it was an entirely wrong decision when it was rendered. The notion that one person could hold another person as his or her property is just beyond the pale of

I think they made a dreadfully wrong decision. 

The Court in the 1930's rejected the so-called Lochner line. The Court, in that line of decisions consistently overturned economic and social legislation passed by the States and even by the Federal Government. That era, in which the Court attempted to curtail economic and social legislation, is over. Although there may be some voices for a return of that kind of judicial activism, I think it is generally recognized that the guardian of our economic and social rights must be the legislatures, State and Federal. 

I don't think, Senator Hatch, that it is a recent development. I think it started decades ago, as I tried to explain in one of the briefs you have, one of the briefs that I referred to yesterday, Struck. 

It started in the 19th century. The Court then said no right is held more sacred or is more carefully guarded by the common law. It grew from our tradition, and the right of every individual to the control of his person. The line of decisions continued through Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942), which recognized the right to have offspring as a basic human right. I have said to this committee that the finest expression of that idea of individual autonomy and personhood, and of the obligation of the State to leave people alone to make basic decisions about their personal life, Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman (1961). 

After Poe v. Ullman, I think the most eloquent statement of it, recognizing that it has difficulties—and it certainly does—is by Justice Powell in Moore v. City of East Cleveland (1977), the case concerning the grandmother who wanted to live with her grandson. Those two cases more than any others—Poe v. Ullman, which was the forerunner of the Griswold (1965) case, and Moore v. City of East Cleveland—explain the concept far better than I can. 

In one case the Court was affirming the right of one man to hold another man in bondage. In the other line of cases, the Court is affirming the right of the individual to be free. So I do see a sharp distinction between the two lines.

Senator Hatch, I agree with the Moore v. City of East Cleveland statement of Justice Powell. He repeats the history to which you have referred, the history of the Lochner era, and says that history "demonstrates there is reason for concern lest judicial intervention become the predilections of those who happen at the moment to be members of the Court." I know that is what your concern is.

He goes on to say that history "counsels caution and restraint," and I agree with that. He then says, "but it does not counsel abandonment," abandonment of the notion that people have a right to make certain fundamental decisions about their lives without interference from the State. And what he next says is, history "doesn't counsel abandonment, nor does it require what the city is urging here"—cutting off the family right at the first boundary, which is the nuclear family. He rejects that. In taking the position I have in all of my writings on this subject, I must associate myself with Justice Powell's satements; otherwise, I could not have written what I did. So I 

The position I have stated here. You asked me how I justify saying that Roe (1973) has two underpinnings, the equal dignity of the woman idea, and the personhood idea of individual autonomy and decisionmaking. I point to those two decision opinions as supplying the essential underpinning.

Thank you. [A short recess was taken.] 

Senator Specter, in that case, in the portion you read, I said that the question was not ripe for our review.

It is a position developed far more extensively than in the abbreviated statement I made in theSanchez-Espinoza (1985) case. The principal exponent was my colleague, Carl McGowan. He wrote persuasively on congressional standing and the concept of ripeness for review. His position was essentially adopted by Justice Powell in Goldwater v. Carter (1979). That case concerned the termination of the Taiwan Defense Treaty.

Senator Specter, the question for me was: Who is the "we"? I have not ruled out the ultimate justiciability of a question of the kind you have raised. What I said was that I associate myself with the position taken by Justice Powell, and in both decisions and law review articles by Carl McGowan, the position that legislators must stand up and be counted in their own House before they can come to court. If Congress puts itself in conflict with the Executive by passing a resolution, by a majority of both Houses, saying we, the Congress, take the position that the Executive is acting in opposition to our will, at that point I could not say there isn't a ripe controversy. But unless and until that occurs, I have taken the position—whether it is Republican Senators or Democratic Senators—that no ripe controversy exists between Congress and the Executive. The controversy ripens only when legislators who oppose to the Executive's position win in their own branch. Until that point is reached, in my view, there is no justiciable controversy between the two branches of government.The President is a unitary. The President takes a position. For Congress to take a position, Congress must act by majority vote. I do not think a group of Senators can come to court and ask the third branch to resolve a clash between the legislative and the executive branches. That is my position on ripeness. I have stated that position in an abbreviated way in Sanchez-Espinoza (1985). Others take different positions. Members of my court have taken other positions.As I see it, there must be a majority vote in Congress before the Executive and the Congress can have a controversy ripe for court to review. If a group of legislators does not prevail in Congress, that group cannot come to court for resolution of a clash that, in my mind, does not exist until it becomes the position of the Congress.That is about all I can say, Senator Specter, on that subject.

That is the kind of question on which you might ask a law teacher to expound. If you are asking me how I would rule as a judge—and you are considering me to be a judge, not a legislator—I would have to say the Korean conflict was a complex operation. If I were presented with the record, the briefs, the arguments, I would be required to make a decision on it on the basis of what the parties present to me. I am afraid I can't do any better than Justice Souter did on that question.The job for which you are considering me is the job of a judge, and a judge has no business expounding on a question like that apart from the record, the briefs, the presentations of the parties. We do have a great attachment in our system of justice to the principle of party presentation. Judges in our system are not inquisitorial. They do not take over the proceedings and pursue what they will. Senator Hatch reminded me of that very forcefully. Very dear to our system of procedure is the principle of party, not judicial, presentations.I can't answer the question about the Korean war off the top of my head. If I were confronted with it as a judge in a case where the issue was justiciable, I would make my decision on the basis of the record, the briefs, and the arguments before me; out of that setting I am not prepared to answer the question.

It isn't clear to me, Senator, that the case won't come back, simply because we have a different regulation now. The gag rule was withdrawn in the very first week of this new administration. But it isn't far-fetched to think the rule could return in another administration.Again, I sense that I am in the position of a skier at the top of that hill, because you are asking me how I would have voted in Rust v. Sullivan (1991). Another member of this committee would like to know how I might vote in that case or another one. I have resisted descending that slope, because once you ask me about this case, then you will ask me about another case that is over and done, and another case. So I believe I must draw the line at the cases I have decided.You asked about my statement in Sanchez-Espinosa, and I answered that question. If you inquire about something I have written, or an authority on which I have relied, I will do my best to respond. But if you ask how I would have voted on an issue that can come back, I must abstain. I can address an issue or case that is never going to come before the Court again—Dred Scott, for example, a decision I said was wrong for all times.The issue in Rust is one that may come back. You can't rule it out, any more than I can. You can say for now the gag rule has been removed, the President removed it in his very first week in office. But it was put in place by the prior administration. I can't rule out the possibility that another administration will put the gag rule back. If I address the question here, if I tell this legislative chamber what my vote would be, then my position as a judge could be compromised. And that is the extreme discomfort I am feeling at the moment. You are asking me to tell you how I would vote on a case you call over and gone, one that can't come up again. I know the case is not going to come up again in the next 4 years. I can't see beyond that. I know that

I am not going to predict the result of the next election, any more than you are, Senator. 

Senator Specter, I think that line of authority has been so discredited by so many Supreme Court decisions, that if anything is well established, it is well established that the Lochner era is over. One cannot say of a recent 5-to-4 decision what one can say about the repudiation of the Lochner line of cases. 

YOU are asking me, what if Congress decided to do that, and if it were challenged in court—I don't think Congress has ever done that, right? 

There is McCardle (1869) and there is Klein (1872), and I don't think there is much more. If Congress were ever to do what your question hypothesizes, there would almost certainly be a challenge and it would almost certainly come before the Court. I can recite the names of the cases that exist, but I can't say anything beyond that. Any further statement would not be in the best interests of the Supreme Court. thaStenyoatuoragSrPeEeCdTwERit.hDMidarybouuraynvs.wMera—diIsobnel1i?eve you did yesterday— Judge GINSBURG. I believe 

I believe the institution of judicial review for constitutionality is well established—I think I expressed myself to that effect yesterday. It is a hallmark of this Nation that our courts exercise that function. We have served as a model for the world in that regard. After World War II, a number of states that never had the institution of judicial review for constitutionality looked to our system as a model. Yes, I feel comfortable that I am not doing any damage to the Supreme Court or the Federal judiciary by saying I believe Marbury v. Madison (1803) is here to stay. 

Senator Specter, so far I have only one granddaughter. 

I am hopeful. I never said the Congress could. I haven't got the case before me. Chief Justice Marshall, in Marbury v. Madison (1803), said you start with the case. As Madison said, before the courts can do anything, they must have a case of a judiciary nature. Then Chief Justice Marshall said, when I have a case, I must apply the law to it, and the highest law in the land is the Constitution. That fundamental law trumps other laws. But judges do not apply the Constitution to abstract questions. I am bound by the case, I must decide the case, that is where a judge gets his or her authority to expound on anything from, from what article III says, from a case or controversy, a case of a justifiable nature. If I may, I do want to emphasize what I hope I have made clear to you, because I do not want to be misunderstood as having criticized this committee. In the article that you read, I confess to an ambiguity. The sentence I wrote was, "The distinction between judicial philosophy and votes in particular cases blurred as the questions and answers wore on." I would like to clarify that I was not criticizing this committee. Far from it. I appreciate now more than ever how difficult it is for the responder to maintain that line and not pass beyond it into forecasting or giving hints about votes in particular cases. I was speaking of the vulnerable responder, not the committee that asked the questions. I might also say, on your question concerning the word "war," it depends on the context. Are you asking about the power of Congress to declare war, or are you speaking in lay terms? I can recite wise counsel that has always shored me up. What a word means depends on the context in which it is used. That you define a word one way in one context doesn't necessarily mean that you should define that word the same way in every other context. The notion that you should, said a great law291 professor, Walter Wheeler Cook, "has all the tenacity of original sin and must constantly be guarded against." So that is what I was guarding against by not answering the question, was the Korean conflict a war. I must ask in what context are you asking that question, are you asking me to decide whether the Executive, in that affair, violated the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to declare war?

In a case of a judiciary nature, I am prepared to do what a judge does.

I am not going to be any more satisfying to you, I am afraid, than I was to Senator Specter. I can answer antitrust questions as they emerge in a case. I said to you yesterday that I believe the only case in which I addressed an antitrust question fully on the merits was the Detroit newspaper case. In my disserting opinion in that case, I attempted faithfully to interpret the Newspaper Preservation Act. I sought to determine what Congress meant in allowing that exemption from the antitrust laws. 

Antitrust, I will confess, is not my strong suit. I have had, as you pointed out, some half a dozen—not many292 more—cases on this court. I think I understand the consumer protective purpose, the entrepreneur, independent decisionmaking protective thrust of those laws, but I can't give you an answer to your abstract question any more than I could—I can't be any more satisfying on the question you are asking me than I was to Senator Specter on the question that he was asking.If you talk about a particular case—my opinion in the Detroit newspapers case was a dissent. There was a division in the court on how to interpret the statute, the Newspaper Preservation Act. That case indicates my approach to determining what Congress meant.

What the Court said—this is to the best of n\, recollection—is that the evidence was too slim in Herrera to make out that claim, and it left the door open to a case where there was stronger evidence of innocence. That case is yet to come before the Court. So my understanding of this case is that, based on its particular record, the Court found the evidence too thin to show innocence, but the Court left open the question whether one could maintain such a plea on a stronger showing than the one made in that case.That is as far as the Herrera case went. The decision left open a case where a stronger showing could be made.

Senator Metzenbaum, the question of habeas review and its limits is before the Senate, before this committee, I believe

I can tell you of the legislation Congress passed for the District in which I operate; that is, we generally do not have habeas review. You have given to the District of Columbia courts a fine postconviction remedy. It is identical to the Federal remedy. The Supreme Court said, some time in the middle 1970's, that one goes from the District of Columbia courts to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court turns down a review request, there is no collateral review in the Federal Courts.Some States must wonder why Congress so values the District of Columbia courts and doesn't similarly value the State courts. But I am now simply stating that in my court we don't have the brand of habeas review that the regional circuits have because Congress has said we don't. One of the reasons is that the President appoints District of Columbia court judges. Although they are not lifetenured judges, they are not elected or appointed by the city government. They are Presidential appointees commissioned to serve as judges for the District of Columbia.What happens next in Federal habeas review, what controls there should be in setting the difficult balance between fairness to the defendant and finality in the system, is going to be your call,295 not the Court's call. The next step will be the legislative response to the Powell Commission report.

No, Senator Grassley, and I will not for this reason. The great bulk of those cases would not be on my recusal list next year in any event, no matter what court I served on. Let me explain.The latest count I got from my chambers, and they checked last night, was 208 automatic recusals, 11 separately listed. You are quite right in reporting that, indeed, it was not my son's two shares of El Paso Natural Gas. In fact, in my early years on the court, there were only four automatic recusals. The great bulk came starting in 1984. A single corporate group my spouse represented from 1984 until this spring accounted for 111 of the 208 cases. That representation is now completed.That representation meant that I tied for second place in the number of recusals listed for judges on my court. Eliminating that group, I would be at or probably below the middle point. But I can represent to you that the representation in question is indeed completed, so that the single corporate group that accounted for 111 of the 208 recusals should no longer be on my recusal list.

Yes, Senator Grassley, the Constitution is established by and for the people through the people's representatives. The individual rights recognized in the Constitution are phrased as restraints on Government. The Constitution says what Government may or may not do.There is a conspicuous exception, an instance in which the Constitution directly applies to persons. That instance is the 13th amendment, which says that slavery shall not exist, slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in the United States. That provision governs everyone in these United States.

In our country, as opposed to some newer democracies, we guarantee directly against Government intrusion into fundamental civil and political rights. Economic and social rights are in the charge of the legislature. Our Constitution does not guarantee a right to work, a right to be fed, a right to be clothed, a right to have decent shelter. Our society is as respectful of those rights as any I know, but the respect comes through measures passed by the legislature, and not in the form of a constitutional command that courts are capable of implementing.

The Court said, just as you summarized it, that the Government cannot take, but it may regulate. There is a point at which the regulation is so enveloping that it becomes a taking. When the Government acts so as to deprive the owner of all of the value of the land, as the Supreme Court said in Lucas (1992), that is tantamount to a taking and it must be compensated.The Lucas case itself went back to the lower court to determine whether that was, indeed, the case—had the owner been deprived of all the economic value of the land. But you are also right, Senator Grassley, that the point at which regulation becomes a taking is something that will be determined case by case. Many cases will come before the Court calling for development of the doctrine of the Lucas case.

I think that our over 200-year-old Constitution has been able to deal with more difficult things than new computer technology. But I would like to consult my daughter on that question, because she is the copyright expert in our family. 

Senator, I am not sure I understand what you mean by scientific speech. 

I can't imagine why not.C

Yes. 

Yes. The period could even be 10 years. Although I think the Supreme Court wrongly decided the women's jury service issue in 1961, by the time of Taylor, in 1976, there was a societal change that the Supreme Court came to understand. True, it took 100 years, practically, for appreciation of the changing position of women in society to be comprehended. But in the Taylor (1975) case, it finally was comprehended. Taylor upset what had been a unanimous precedent the other way. 

Well, that is why we have the law. That is why we have a system of stare decisis. It keeps judges from infusing their own moral beliefs, from making themselves kings or queens. That accounts for my answer to a question I have been asked here a few times. How do you feel about this or that? I responded that how I feel is not relevant to the job for which you are considering me. 

Yes, that 4s certainly true. I have to be aware of it. I must know that it is there and guard against confusing my own predilections with what is the law. 

Yes, I think I can manage that all right.319 

If I have written something, either an opinion or an article, and you want to ask me about what I wrote, something you think should be clarified or questioned, then you can confront me with my writing. Yes, I think that is right. 

Senator Cohen, I have asked you to judge me on the basis of my written record, and I have said what that recordcontains. So, yes. I regard this hearing as in the nature of an oral argument where I can clarify what is in that written record.Now, it is true, as just occurred, that when one writes over 700 opinions in the course of 13 years, one must sometimes refresh one's recollection. One of your colleagues just said to me, well, in the case of United States v. Jackson (1987), you said such-and-so. Another of your colleagues said, in the Xidex (1991) case, where you were on the panel, the court unanimously ruled thus and so. In both instances, I had to refresh my recollection.

Right. 

Right. 

Right. 

Joined with me, right. 

Yes. 

Yes, I think base discrimination is deplorable and against the spirit of this country. Discrimination, arbitrary discrimination without reason—— 

If I discriminate against a person for reasons that are irrelevant to that person's talent or ability, that is what I meant when I said rank discrimination. Arbitrary discrimination, unrelated to a person's ability or worth, unrelated to a person's talent, discrimination simply because of who that person is and not what that person can do. 

A person's birth status should not enter into the way that person is treated. A person who is born into a certain home with a certain religion or is born of a certain race, those are characteristics irrelevant to what that person can do or contribute to society. 

Senator, you know that is a burning question virtually certain to come before the Court. I cannot address that question without violating what I said had to be my rule about no hints, no forecasts, no previews.

I think rank discrimination for any reason, hair color, eye color, you name it, rank discrimination is un-American. There must be a reason, as you said, for any classification. Government can't take action

May I just say one further word about the Goldman case? 

The panel of the District of Columbia Circuit that decided the Goldman (1986) case said the very nature of a uniform regulation is its arbitrariness. That panel, as you know, was among the most "liberal" benches one could draw, if one labels judges liberal or conservative. Those three judges stressed the necessarily arbitrary nature of military uniform regulations. The panel was dealing with a discrete category; the opinion was not meant to spill over to any other area. Military uniforms could be arbitrary. That, in sum, was the decision of the panel of my court in 

I hope so, too. 

Yes, Mr. Chairman. Race classifications are subject to strict scrutiny, and the State must have a compelling interest to justify such a classification. We have not seen such an interest in some time. 

The purpose of the Miranda warnings is to make certain that a defendant's rights are known to the defendant, so the defendant can exercise them—the right not to speak and the information that, if you do, your words can be used against you, the right to an attorney and the knowledge that if you are unable to pay for counsel, a lawyer will be provided for you by the State. Those, it seems to me, are constitutional rights that should be brought home to every defendant.Now, sophisticated defendants will know them without being told, but the unsophisticated won't. This practical approach, the Miranda warnings, has become familiar to all, thanks to television. I think it has worked.

In a situation like this, where the object is to ensure that a defendant knows about the right to counsel, knows that the defendant is not obliged to incriminate herself or himself, these are salutary rules that have safeguarded the constitutional right. Frankly, from my point of view, it makes the system run better because then one need not ask case-by-case: Did this defendant know that he had a right to counsel? Did he intelligently waive that right?It avoids controversies. It is an assurance that people know their rights. It is an assurance that the law is going to be administered even-handedly, because, as I said, sophisticated defendants who have counsel ordinarily will know about their rights, so it is an assurance of the even-handed administration of justice.

Senator, I appreciate the concern you are bringing up. It isn't hypothetical. There are judges who are in that situation. They are rare, one or two in close to a thousand.

SO I appreciate the problem. When I was asked before about cameras in the courtroom, I was careful to qualify my own view. I said I would, of course, give great deference to the views of my colleagues on this subject. An experiment is going on right now in the Federal courts on that subject. I don't feel comfortable expressing my own view, without information concerning the view of the U.S. Judicial Conference on this subject. I know that the judges are going to study the Kastenmeier report, and they are going to react to it. I can just say that I appreciate it is a very grave problem. 

Just as Members of Congress prize their speech or debate immunity, so judges prize their independence, the guarantee that they shall hold office during good behavior.

The Supreme Court has said repeatedly that Congress has full power over Indian affairs. A major source of that authority is, of course, article I, section 8, where the power is lodged in Congress. It surely is not lodged in the courts. The one thing that is clear is that the courts are obliged faithfully to follow the treaties and laws in this area as set by Congress. The courts do not have any law-creation role to play. This is not a common law area. This is an area for Congress to control. It is a very difficult area, and the courts will have construction questions presented to them. But that the Congress has the lead role and not the courts I think is plain.I have done my best, Senator, to answer your questions on this subject. As I have explained, a judge works from a specific case. I have said that in answer to a number of your questions. I can't answer abstract inquiries even in areas I have studied. I can't answer an abstract issue. I work from a specific case based on the record of that case, the briefs that are presented, the parties' presentations, and decide the case in light of that record, those briefs. I simply cannot, even in areas that I know very well, answer an issue abstracted from a concrete case. That is not the way a judge works.

I have no question about the authority of Congress to override the Supreme Court decision in Duro v. Reina (1990).

I can only repeat the answer that I gave you, Senator Pressler, that Congress has full power over Indian affairs. There is no restriction on a Native American to live in any community that he or she chooses. So we are discussing only the difficult concept of tribal sovereignty and how Congress has chosen to treat that. I certainly didn't mean to suggest that a Native Americanoutside of a tribal setting doesn't have the same rights as you and I do.

Thank you. 

Yes, I am pleased. [Laughter.] Senator SlMON. You will bring to the Court more background in international law than any other member of the Court. You will certainly be the only member of the Court who has ever translated Swedish law into English, I am absolutely positive of that. Though, come to think about it, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is a very Swedish name, and he may Judge GINSBURG. Swedish or Norwegian. Senator SlMON. He is Norwegian? Judge GINSBURG. It could be. Swedish or Norwegian, I don't know. 

Senator Simon, I can only tell you the code of conduct I would adopt for myself wherever I am, here or abroad, and that is the Constitution of the United States. I would consider it binding on me. I can perhaps cite an example. There is a good book called "Judgment in Berlin," written by a former Federal judge, Judge Stern, who was sent to judge a hijacking case in Berlin. It was a sensitive case in the international community. A plane was hijacked from Poland, I believe, to take people who had been in East Germany into West Germany. The hijacking presented a sensitive question within Germany. So a court that had been created in World WarII, called the United States Court for Berlin, was resurrected, and a U.S. district judge, Judge Stern, was sent there.He was told by the State Department that the alleged hijackers would have only such rights as the State Department chose to give them. Judge Stern said, I am a Federal judge, the Constitution is my law, and that is the law I am going to apply in any proceeding over which I preside.He made sure that defendants had very able counsel—there were two defendants—and that they got the full panoply of rights we accord criminal defendants. He did something remarkable in a country that does not use juries. He insisted that there be a jury trial. The case was tried under German law, under German substantive law, but according to U.S. procedures. And that procedural law was largely determined by the rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution. It is a wonderful example, I think, of the way any Federal official should behave at home or abroad. The Constitution and the Federal law should be our guide wherever we are.

Thank you so much, Senator Simon. 

That was 2 days, at least when I took it, back in ancient times. The bar exam was 2 days. I don't know what it is now. 

Not unless the Government takes over the business of insurance. You know that differentials of that same nature work the other way for pensions. Women, on average, live longer than men. Many women die young; many men live long. But, on average, it is unquestionably true that women live longer than men. And so, until not so long ago, when people retired, the women got less than the men because it was thought that there was actuarial equality. Women would live longer. Women, on average, would live longer so, in the end, they would get the same amount, but it would be stretched out over a longer period of time.Lawsuits were brought challenging that differential under title VII. The hook was not the Constitution because the Constitution restricts government action, not private action. It was the civil rights, equal employment opportunity legislation Congress had passed. Title VII is applicable to the private sector. And it was often private employers who were providing these plans to their employees. The private employer is covered by title VII and cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, not because of the Constitution but because of the law that Congress passed.So in group plans connected with employment, those differentials are unlawful. They aren't unlawful yet—unless Congress passes a law so regulating the insurance industry—on an individual basis. If I want to buy an annuity from a private insurance company, then, barring some State law, the insurance company can still say I will get less per month than a man of identical age because, on average, women live longer than men. But in group plans that is no longer permissible because of title VII.It isn't true for individual plans any more than it is for automobile insurance, and I know just what you are talking about because we had the identical experience when my son got his driver's license. Our premium went way up.

I will remain silent on that subject. 

The equal protection clause applies to government action, and there have been two cases that have come up in the course of these discussions: one, the Croson(1989) case, involving city plans, and the other, MetropolitanBroadcasting (1990), involving Federal plans. Government action is restricted; it is controlled by the equal protection guarantee. Private action in the employment sector is controlled by title VII prohibiting discrimination on the ground of race, national origin, religion, sex. So while the equal protection principle doesn't apply, the title VII legislation does apply and does control affirmative action programs in the private sector. 

Senator Brown, I am so glad you prefaced your inquiry by saying you would understand if I resisted a response, because in this area, I sense that anything I say could be taken as a hint or a forecast of how I would, treat a classification that is going to be in question before a court, and ultimately the Supreme Court. So I think it is best that I not say anything that could be used as a prediction of how I might vote with regard to that classification. 

Thank you. I appreciate that. [A short recess was taken.]

That's correct, Senator. We paid dues, but not initiation for the period from August 1980 when I joined, until April 1983, when I resigned. 

NO, but I do know what the dues were at the time that I resigned, I mean the initiation. The initiation at the time I resigned, which Judge Harry Edwards and I were asked to pay, I believe was $25,000. 

I avoided commenting on Supreme Court decisions when other Senators raised that question, so I must adhere to that position.

That falls in the same category as the prior question. You are inviting comment on Supreme Court opinions, or separate opinions, in an area live with business. We get Federal election campaign business regularly in the District of Columbia Circuit. The Supreme Court gets some of that business. So this is a vibrant area for challenge.

YOU brought up the Red Lion (1969) case, which indicates one line that has been drawn. There is no right to reply to a newspaper comment. There is no fairness doctrine applicable there. Tornillo (1974) is the rule. The different regime for the broadcast media was once explained on the basis of the scarcity of the spectrum. That is a less tenable ground for distinction today. The fairness doctrine is up for consideration again. The must carry rules are alive and are in litigation. Again, I can refer to the distinction drawn between the print media and the broadcast media. But beyond that, I can't comment on the fairness doctrine or the "must carry" rules, the differential regulation of the broadcast media. You said it so well, and in a lot fewer words that I have been using. I can't go further at this point.

YOU are so kind, and I know it has been a very busy, important day for you.

Senator Specter, I have said that there is a free speech value on one side. There is the equal dignity of the individual on the other side. I cannot say more on that subject except this is an area where two values are in tension. How they will be resolved in any given case will depend on the facts of that particular case.

The arguments are being made, Senator Specter, as you well know, in constitutional terms, and they are being made on both grounds. They are being made in terms of the community, the group that is being assaulted, and also in terms of the individual, who is being denigrated or harassed because of the individual's membership in that particular group.This is a very trying issue for our time: the individual's right to be free and the individual's respect for others. One hopes that we can reason together and get the message of mutual respect across to our young people so that there will not be the kind of clashes that we have seen.But our country has gone through this periodically. I remember in the late 1960's—what was that movement called? It was particularly big in California. The free speech movement, was it not? I remember teaching in New Jersey in the late 1960's when there was turmoil all over, and I vividly recall a class I was teaching, a procedure class. A student sat in a tree outside the classroom thumbing his nose at me throughout the class. I had to face the question,359 should I call the police to take him away, or should I try to ignore him?In 1965 or 1966, Earl Warren came to Newark, NJ, to attend the dedication of our law school building. People paraded around the block in various costumes to mimic cases he had decided. The police asked him, should we remove these people because they are causing a disturbance? And he said, "No, let them demonstrate. Let them exercise their free speech rights."I can recall on that campus, again in the late 1960's, when universities contended with both racial turmoil and the free speech movement, that some minority students charged genocide against the Jews for their treatment of the Palestinians. I placed on a bulletin board, side by side with their charge, an explanation of the U.N. Genocide Convention and how it had come about, how it had emerged from the Holocaust. And I watched as some students, looking at what I posted, said, "We really got a rise out of that Jew, didn't we?" That was their response to my attempt to be reasonable, to reason with them about the Genocide Convention.So I know how difficult these situations are to resolve. I know how much, as an individual with emotions, I would want to call in the police and say, this person is doing an injury to me, to my feelings. But I never did, Senator Specter, because I know, too, the lesson Holmes tried to teach about maximum freedom for the speech we hate.I can tell you those personal experiences, and say that what we are witnessing is not something new. What we are seeing on our college campuses now, altogether we have seen before. And somehow we came through that period of the late 1960's. We went back to the relative calm and peace of the universities we knew before then and will know again. And that is about what I can say on this subject.

I have no comment on that, Senator Specter. I have said that these issues will be coming before the Court. I will not say anything in this legislative Chamber that will hint or forecast how I will vote in cases involving those particular classifications.

Senator Specter, I will address questions that come to me in the context of a specific case, on the basis of the facts of that specific case, on the record that is presented in that case, on the arguments the lawyers make, and on the applicable law and precedent, but I will not address an abstract issue. Issues do not come before judges in that form.

Senator Specter, the first amendment prohibits the establishment of religion and protects the free exercise thereof. How the line is drawn between those two safeguards will depend upon the facts of the specific case. I am not going to expound on the matter at large and answer an abstract question. I have said what I feel comfortable saying on that subject.

Thank you. 

Such a controversy, whatever other threshold barriers might be argued, would be ripe only if Congress as a body put itself in opposition to the Executive. 

Right. 

But I am not Professor Ginsburg. I am Judge Ginsburg and I belong to the third branch. You have a very able Senate counsel. He has appeared before us a number of times. I would refer that question to the Office of Senate Counsel for advice. One thing I can't do is give an advisory opinion, even if the parties file pleadings for one.

No, I spoke of a position I had taken in court on ripeness. I have taken the position, together with my colleague, my former colleague Judge McGowan, that these cases are not fare for the courts, unless and until Members of Congress stand up and are counted. I was simply repeating a position that I have taken.

Thank you. 

Right. 

I can simply cite what I have accepted as entirely compatible with my job as a judge, and that is the historical practice of opening each court day with "God save the United States and this Honorable Court." I don't regard that historic practice as a violation of the establishment clause. If I did, I would have no business entering court when those words are said.

May I say, if my mother-in-law is watching, she just loves you, Senator Hatch? [Laughter.] 

Thank you.
