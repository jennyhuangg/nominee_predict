Yes, Senator. I do not know what happened to the ninth. He is supposed to be here, too.He is here. They are all here, Senator. I have a full house. I was worried about that.

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you. 

It was a case of my integrity overcoming my judgment, Senator.

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I have been to Alabama several times too. [Laughter.]

It will. 

I would, Senator. They have taken a lot of trouble to get dressed up and come downtown. I think the little ones will probably want to leave after the first recess, but I did want to give them their moment in the limelight here, if I can remember all the names. [Laughter.]

I think all nine are here, Senator. I think we have a full committee.My wife, Maureen, is at the right in the front row. Next to her is Meg. Her real name is Margaret but she said I should introduce her as Meg because when she is called Margaret, she is usually in trouble. Catherine, Christopher, Matthew. And in the next row, from the other end, Mary, and my oldest, Ann, Eugene, John, Paul, and that is it.

But do not try me on the ages Senator. I would also like to introduce, behind me, my law clerk, Patrick Schiltz who has helped me in getting together the materials I will probably need for this hearing. 

NO, I do not, Senator, except to express my honor at being nominated by the President, and the fact that I am happy to be here and look forward to answering the committee's questions. 

Well, I think you have correctly identified the major one, that there is no one to correct your mistakes when you are up there, except the constitutional amendment process.In a way, there is a lesser body of law to look to. As a circuit judge, I accept as precedent not just the opinions of the Supreme Court, of course, but the earlier opinions of my own circuit, and accept as very persuasive the opinions of other circuits. So it is a much vaster body of law that I have to consult in order to make my decisions.At the Supreme Court level, the most persuasive precedent is just Supreme Court precedent, although, to some extent, lower court opinions are looked to, but that body of precedent is not nearly as important.I think you have put your finger on what the main difference is, and that is that at the circuit court level, the opinions of the Supreme Court are the last word, and we follow them unwaveringly.At the Supreme Court that is not quite the situation as the Supreme Court is bound to its earlier decisions by the doctrine of stare decisis in which I strongly believe.Other than that, I suppose it is more difficult to be sitting in a panel of nine judges all the time. On my circuit court we now have 11, and when we sit en bane it is a much more ponderous group to bring to a consensus than is a panel of three, which is the normal panel. I expect that that would be quite a difference.

I will be happy to. I think a lot of Americans do not realize what a

I will not do it. I will not do it. [Laughter.] I think most of the questions today will probably be about that portion of the Constitution that is called the Bill of Rights, which is a very important part of it, of course. But if you had to put your finger on what has made our Constitution so enduring, I think it is the original document before the amendments were added. Because the amendments, by themselves, do not do anything. The Russian constitution probably has better, or at least as good guarantees of personal freedom as our document does. What makes it work, what assures that those words are not just hollow promises, is the structure of government that the original Constitution established, the checks and balances among the three branches, in particular, so that no one of them is able to "run roughshod" over the liberties of the people as those liberties are described in the Bill of Rights. If I had to put my finger on what it was that has made the difference, that is it. 

The proper relationship of course is that Federal law is supreme. If the Federal Government acts in a field over which it has authority, State law has to step back.When that should happen, of course, is most often a question of prudence and that means that it is most often a question for this body to decide, when it wishes to displace State law, and when not. When it does so, that is the end of the matter.

Well, I have to say it must have been misunderstanding, Senator. I do not know of anything in my opinions, or my writings, that would display anything other than a high regard, and a desire to implement to the utmost the requirements of the first amendment.As a matter of fact, as Senator Moynihan mentioned this morning, I am the first academic to be nominated to the Court since Frankfurter. I have spent my life in the field that the first amendment is most designed to protect. In addition to having been a scholar, and a writer as a scholar, I think I am one of the few Supreme Court nominees that has been the editor of a magazine.So why anyone would think that I—if anything—if I were to have a skewed view of the first amendment, Senator, it would be in just the opposite direction.

Well, Marbury is of course one of the great pillars of American law. It is the beginning of the Supreme Court as the interpreter of the Constitution. I hesitate to answer, and indeed think I should not answer the precise question you ask—do I agree that Marbury v. Madison means that in no instance can either of the other branches call into question the action of the Supreme Court.As I say, Marbury v. Madison is one of the pillars of the Constitution. To the extent that you think a nominee would be so foolish, or so extreme as to kick over one of the pillars of the Constitution, I suppose you should not confirm him. But I do not think I should answer questions regarding any specific Supreme Court opinion, even one as fundamental as Marburyv.Madison.If you could conclude from anything I have written, or anything I have said, that I would ignore Marbury v. Madison, I would too bein trouble, without your asking me specifically my views on Marbury v.Madison.

NO; I do not 

AS to the second part, Senator, what do I think of those warnings, I am happy to answer it as a policy matter, assuming the questions is not, you know, what do I think as to the extent to which those warnings, in one circumstance or another, are required by the Constitution. As a policy matter, I think—as far as I know, everybody thinks— it is a good idea to warn a suspect of his rights as soon as it is practicable. I do not know of anyone who thinks it should be otherwise. As soon as the suspect is brought within the control of the police, he should have knowledge what his rights are, as a policy matter. The other part of your question, if I recall, was do I think the Supreme Court has been influenced by the views of police officers and law enforcement officials. I suppose—I do not think the Supreme Court lives in a vacuum. It reads the newspapers. I suppose it is influenced by the reaction of a society to its decisions; at least I hope it is. I think it should be. One would not know whether one's decisions are doing good or bad unless one consulted the effect of them. 

Whether it provided sufficient guidance, I am not sure I have the data that I would need in order to answer that question. It is always a difficult problem. One of the hardest problems, I think, for an appellate judge is how broadly one wants to write an opinion. Certainly, providing guidance is one of the purposes of an appellate opinion. So you can write an opinion very broadly, whichwill answer all the questions for the next 50 years, or you can write it very narrowly, and just answer this particular case, and let the next one come up when it does.It is a hard call as to how far you go in one direction or another. I really do not know whether the Supreme Court has been as informative as it could be or should be.I have to say, not having been there, I am sure they did what they thought was best.

Well, Senator, nobody likes frivolous appeals, I suppose, in any matter, criminal or civil. But to the extent that your question is asking about legislation, I should not have a view about it. And to the extent that it is asking whether the Supreme Court ought to change its view of what the law requires to provide fewer appeals, I ultimately will have to have an opinion about it, but should not set it forth here.

NO; I do not think that will—I mean, appropriate. I assume you are saying, appropriate. Congress can alter the standard of review considerably.I am not aware of any great dissatisfaction in the administrative law community. And I think I am fairly familiar with that community, having been a denizen of it for a number of years.I do not know that there is any great dissatisfaction with the general scope of review of administrative action that now exists, which essentially is an arbitrary and capricious standard. The fine call is for the agency. And the courts look it over to see that it has not been so unreasonable as to be arbitrary or capricious.As far as I know, it seems to have worked pretty well. As to whether there is review in enough cases, and there should be review in more cases or in fewer cases, that is really a call for the Congress on which I do not have any particular, special views. 

No; I think you have them there, Senator. Personally, and I guess you—no, I do not think you would get as many answers as you asked judges—personally I would not want a scientific expert on my staff. Institutions tend to do what you give them the capability to do. And if you give courts scientifically expert staff, they are going to become bodies that inquire into the scientific rights and wrongs of particular decisions. And simply the way our system is set up, those scientific judgments have been left to the Congress to make when it passes legislation, and to the Executive to make, to an even greater degree, by delegation from the Congress. As I said earlier with reference to your question on the standard of review, all the courts are there for is to see whether the agency has followed the proper procedures, which is critically important, and whether in the final judgment the agency reaches, the agency has been within the bounds of reason. I think I can tell, without a scientific expert, just on the basis of the record in the case, whether it is in the bounds of reason. And I personally would not want the courts to go any further than that, or you are just duplicating the work of administrative agencies. 

Senator, antitrust law has never been one of my fields. Indeed, in law school, I never understood it. I later found out, in reading the writings of those who now do understand it, that I should not have understood it because it did not make any sense then. As to whether the Court has—so I really am in no position. All I can tell you is hearsay, Senator, from those who follow the field. I do understand that the rules have changed in recent years, and that the Court is applying the principles and the data that economists have accumulated over the years regarding the sensible application of the antitrust laws. But I have not had a single antitrust case since I have been on the D.C. Circuit. And I have not complained about that, either. 

Senator, I can only speak from my own court. And before my court, it is excellent. I cannot speak highly enough aboutthe bar that practices before me. I think there is an enormous proportion of highly competent lawyers who do fine work not only for their client but for the court in informing us of the issues of law that we have to decide.On the basis of what I see before my court, which is maybe not a typical court, the advocacy is good.

Excuse me? 

Senator, I do not think it would be proper for me to answer that question. 

I mean, if I can say why. Let us assume that I have people arguing before me to do it or not to do it. I think it is quite a thing to be arguing to somebody who you know has made a representation in the course of his confirmation hearings, and that is, by way of condition to his being confirmed, that he will do this or do that. I think I would be in a very bad position to adjudicate the case without being accused of having a less than impartial view of the matter. 

AS you know, Senator, they are sometimes overruled. 

My view is that they are sometimes overruled. And I think that 

It does not depend on my view. It depends on the nature of the precedent, the nature of the issue. Let us assume that somebody runs in from Princeton University, and on the basis of the latest historical research, he or she has discovered a lost document which shows that it was never intended that the Supreme Court should have the authority to declare astatute unconstitutional. I would not necessarily reverse Marbury v. Madison on the basis of something like that.To some extent, Government even at the Supreme Court level is a practical exercise. There are some things that are done, and when they are done, they are done and you move on. Now, which of those you think are so woven in the fabric of law that mistakes made are too late to correct, and which are not, that is a difficult question to answer. It can only be answered in the context of a particular case, and I do not think that I should answer anything in the context of a particular case.

That is right, sir. And nobody arguing that case before me should think that he is arguing to somebody who has his mind made up either way. 

Of course. 

That is the question you asked earlier, Senator. And that is precisely the question 

I do not think it affects it at all, Senator. The three-judge district court decision in Synar decided the case on the assumption that the decision in Humphreys Executor permitted the prohibition by Congress of Presidential removal, except for cause. It was done on that assumption. 

Senator 

You are asking now not about the removal of power but about excessive delegation? 

Well, again, I am reluctant to talk about what Scalia will say in the future. I can talk about what he said in the past, and I think you have me on the wrong side on the matter 

I would support a broad congressional mandate that is not unconstitutionally overbroad, yes. [Laughter.] 

But, seriously, I am not trying to go around and around. I think I am accurate in saying that my writings do not show that I am likely to be more restrictive on that matter than others. 

I think I know 

Senator, I think again—I think you have me wrong. I have criticized, and I think I have often said in my writings and in my speeches that Congress should be more specific; that the more specific Congress can be, the more democratic the judgment is, because if Congress is not specific, the judgment is made by the courts, and the courts are not democratic institutions. So I have criticized what seemed to me as a policy matter the overgenerality of the statutes. But the reason I criticize them is precisely because even though they are overgeneral, they will, by and large, be upheld and implemented by the courts. And the courts will determine what they mean. I do not think that that is ordinarily the better way to do it to the extent that Congress has the time, and I know that is a problem. The import of my earlier writings was that Congress ought to try to be more specific. But that does not speak, Senator, to whether if it chooses not to be more specific, the law will be unconstitutional. 

Well, I guess I would respond that my dissent was joined by my liberal colleagues, Judge Wald and Judge Edwards. I leave it there. 

It is true, Senator. How can I withdraw from it? 

It is one of the means that the Congress has at its disposal. 

Well, I will certainly approach it with an awareness of the importance of both of the elements that are in contention there, of the first amendment as of normal importance in the ability of the people to speak, to learn and, on the other hand, the national security interest is often of great importance. That is the worst problem about being a judge. It is never something on one side. I mean you can be criticized for coming out against the first amendment, and one never hears what is on the other side of that case. There is always some important interest on the other side or it would not be a case. I cannot be any more specific in response to your question except to say that I am seriously interested in both of the principles, both of the concerns that arise in those cases. I am aware of the importance of the first amendment, and will give it the full weight that the Constitution accords it. 

I am not sure the latter is true, Senator. I think I may have criticized the decision, but I do not recall passing moral judgment on the issue. But I agree with your opening statement, that one of the primary qualifications for a judge is to set aside personal views. 

Well, Senator, one of the moral obligations that a judge has is the obligation to live in a democratic society and to be bound by the determinations of that democratic society. If he feels that he cannot be, then he should not be sitting as a judge. There are doubtless laws on the books apart from abortion that I might not agree with, that I might think are misguided, perhaps some that I might even think in the largest sense are immoral in the results that they produce. In no way would I let that influence my determination of how they apply. And if indeed I felt that I could not separate my repugnance for the law from my impartial judgment of what the Constitution permits the society to do, I would recuse myself from the case. 

That is not quite what I said, Senator. I did not say that I would recuse myself in the 

I do not know what Judge Noonan told you. Judge Noonan had indeed written considerably in the field and had been one of the leading advocates. 

I do not think I fall into that category.

That is right. 

Yes, it is, Senator. And what I am further saying is that I do not think that reasonable people think that the moral views that judges may hold on one piece of legislation or one decision or another so automatically beclouds their judgment that they must disqualify themselves. I do not think that the records of the Supreme Court could possibly be read to establish that as the basis of disqualification on bigamy, on capital punishment, on an enormous number of things that men and women on the Court have had strong moral views doubtless and have sat nonetheless. 

I think the statute reads that way, Senator. I have the statute somewhere. I am quite sure that the way you put it is about the way the statute reads, requiring disqualification. If I may, title 28, United States Code, section 455: "Any justice, judge or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." 

Well, I think the length of time is a considerably important factor. The Marbury v. Madison example that I gave in response to Senator Kennedy. I am not sure that I agree with Justice Rehnquist that the closeness of the prior decision makes that much difference. I mean, if Marbury v. Madison had been 5 to 4,1 am not sure I would reverse it today. But I can understand how some judges might consider that that is an appropriate factor as well. I agree—I certainly agree with the former. The latter would not have occurred to me, but maybe. 

Senator, I really do not think I should give my view. You are talking about an area in which it is a sure thing that there are going to be a lot more—the one thing you can say for sure about the Supreme Court decisions is that they have not answered all the questions. There is doubtless going to be a lot more litigation in that field. And I do not think here that I should commit myself to a point of view. If that is Justice O'Connor's opinion, and the position of a majority of the Court, that does not prove that it will not be argued to the contrary. And I have spoken my piece about stare decisis, but stare decisis is quite different from committing myself to a view before the committee that is responsible for confirming me to the Court. 

Oh, I do not think it all has to be in a single majority opinion. I mean, if you have three separate opinions that add up to five justices for a particular principle of law, that principle of law has been found in that case.

Very few. Senator, because we do not have a Federal prison within our jurisdiction. It is over in the Fourth Circuit.

Senator, to tell you the truth, that really is a subject that I have not given thought to. And it is scary, is it not? I do not know. I think that must be a very hard call.I cannot imagine a more important issue. And you have painted the considerations on the other side. All I can say is, I will do my best.

NO; I do not look forward to that as the most enjoyable part of the job, Senator.

Oh, unquestionably, Senator. I do not think there is any doubt about that, including in some very important and difficult areas.I guess the case that comes immediately to mind is the Bakke case on affirmative action, where what is said to be the holding of the Court is really the holding of the opinion of only one of the Justices, Justice Powell, because there were three opinions, one for four of the Justices, Justice Powell, and one for the other four. And the four that Justice Powell joined became the majority. So his opinion is quoted as the opinion of the Court.It makes for a very confusing situation. I do not know what the solution is, except for self-restraint, I suppose. I have not been notable for writing separately on the Court that I sit on; notable for the quantity, I hope to mean.As you know, other systems get along without it entirely. The European system typically has an unsigned opinion for the entire court, and you either win over the majority to your view, or your view does not appear.One can run a system that way. But that is not in keeping with the rugged individualism of the common law judge, which is a quality that I think we want to retain. So I do think you need to leave room for dissents and concurrences. All I say is, it takes some selfrestraint, and I hope to bring it to bear.

I am trying to fight against that here, Senator. 

I am trying to fight against that inclination here. 

Yes; I will be happy too. But you ought to begin by noting that in that speech, I did not advocate the original intent doctrine. I just said that it should be known as the original meaning doctrine.

Yes, well I will be happy to explain 

That is a good question, Senator. I am embarrassed to say this. I am 50 years old, grown up, and everything. I cannot say that I have a fully framed omnibus view of the Constitution. Now, there are those who do who have written pieces on constitutional interpretation, and here is the matrix, and here is how you do it. I think it is fair to say you would not regard me as someone who would be likely to use the phrase, living Constitution. On the other hand, I am not sure you can say, he is pure and simply an original meaning—I will be happy to explain the difference between original meaning and original intent. It is not worth it. It is not a big difference. 

What I think is that the Constitution is obviously not meant to be evolvable so easily that in effect a court of nine judges can treat it as though it is a bring-along-with-me statute and fill it up with whatever content the current times seem to require. To a large degree, it is intended to be an insulation against the current times, against the passions of the moment that may cause individual liberties to be disregarded, and it has served that func-tion valuably very often. So I would never use the phrase, living Constitution.Now, there is within that phrase, however, the notion that a certain amount of development of constitutional doctrine occurs, and I think there is room for that. I frankly—the strict original intentist, I think, would say that even such a clause as the cruel and unusual punishment clause would have to mean precisely the same thing today that it meant in 1789.

Yes, so that if lashing was fine then, lashing would be fine now. I am not sure I agree with that. I think that there are some provisions of the Constitution that may have a certain amount of evolutionary content within them. I have never been—what should I say—as I said earlier, I have not developed a full constitutional matrix. You are right, though, in suspecting me to be more inclined to the original meaning than I am to a phrase like "living Constitution." 

I did not mean it that way. 

I have always had trouble with lashing, Senator. I have always had trouble thinking that that is constitutional. And if I have trouble with that 

I am being serious, no; I am being serious. 

Senator, I think you were out of the room when I was asked about independent agencies before. I would love to talk about independent agencies. It has been an area—an abiding interest of mine. And my writings will have to speak for themselves.But I have a real special problem when it comes to discussing this topic. Which is, not just that the case will come before the Supreme Court if I am confirmed, but that I have a case before my present court, mounting precisely the kind of constitutional case you have just described. It is currently before the court on which I sit. And I really think I should not be discussing the

Could I say this, though, Senator, which speaks not to the constitutionality of it at all, but to the fact that it may be—there may be less to it than meets the eye. Because I have found that there is not much difference, if indeed there is any difference, in modern times between the independent agencies, in the proper sense, and other executive agencies. Indeed, many people do not know which is which. The Food and Drug Administration, for example. Most people think it is an independent agency. It is not an independent agency. It is an executive branch agency. Yet it seems to be as independent of Presidential improper influence as one of the independents.

I define speech as any communicative activity. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes. Well—do you want to talk about it? 

Let us talk about that. Watt was a case in which what was at issue was sleeping as communicative activity. 

I did not say in the separate opinion that I wrote in that case, and that opinion was a dissent 

Not the rationale. What I said was that for purposes of the heightened protections that are accorded, sleeping could not be speech. That is to say, I did not say that one could prohibit sleeping merely for the purpose of eliminating the communicative aspect of sleeping, if there is any. It was alleged that there was in this case, because people wanted to sleep in the national park across from the White House in order to demonstrate that there were homeless. And it was alleged that the sleeping was a communicative activity.52 I did not say that the Government could seek to prohibit that communication without running afoul of the heightened standards of the first amendment. If they passed a law that allows all other sleeping but only prohibits sleeping where it is intended to communicate, then it would be invalidated. But what I did say was, where you have a general law that just applies to an activity which in itself is normally not communicative, such as sleeping, spitting, whatever you like; clenching your fist, for example; such a law would not be subject to the heightened standards of the first amendment. That is to say, if there is ordinary justification for it, it is fine. It does not have to meet the high need, the no other available alternative requirements of the first amendment. Whereas, when you are dealing with communicative activity, naturally communicative activity—writing, speech, and so forth— any law, even if it is general, across the board, has to meet those higher standards. 

No; I would think that that law—no; I cannot imagine that you are entitled to—that would allow you to disobey any law that does not have a very serious governmental purpose, just for the purpose of showing your contempt of that law. For example, the best way to communicate your contempt for a law against spitting in the street is to spit in the street. How better to show your contempt for that law, except by disobeying it? 

That is right. 

I think not, Senator. In fact, it seems to me it happens all the time when people protest in front of some embassies. Those laws are not subjected to heightened scrutiny, I do not believe. They are just laws that you cannot be at a certain location. If you want to protest, as a means of civil disobedience, and take the penalty, that is fine. But if the law is not itself directed against demonstrations or against communication, I do not think it is the kind of law that in and of itself requires the heightened scrutiny. That was the only point I was making in 

And listen, I may be talked out of that. I am just explaining to you what I was saying in CCNY.

I thought it worked. I mean, the explanation. 

I will have to write longer opinions. 

OK; thank you. 

I think that is a good idea, Mr. Chairman. 

It was mentioned earlier that a lot of my opinions are in the regulatory field; that is a field in which I used to labor. Administrative law was one of the subjects that I taught, and as I mentioned earlier, I was editor of Regulation magazine. And one of my policy preferences in those days was deregulation. But an examination of my opinions will show that I have fully enforced actions by agencies that go in precisely the opposite direction; and indeed, I have stopped agencies from going in a deregulatory direction when it seemed to me, however unwise it might have been as a policy matter, the statute simply did not let them do it. So it is doable, is all I am saying, Senator. And I think I can do it. 

I think that is right, Senator. 

Well, the start of it is, Senator, that I—maybe it is a quirky cast of mind, I do not know, but I like playing with statutes and finding out what they mean. And that is where I start from; not, where would I like to come out in this particular case. And I think that is what any good judge—how any good judge approaches the matter. And from there, you obviously have to read, with attention, the briefs of both sides; listen to the arguments of both sides; and not make up your mind firmly. You cannot help getting intimations of which way you are leaning as you go along. But do not make up your mind firmly until you are all done with everything, including the oral argument and including listening to the comments of your colleagues in the conference after oral argument. It is a difficult process. But I do not think it takes a superhuman effort to come out a way that you do not think is sound as a policy matter. You learn very soon that the policy calls are not yours to make. And there are a lot of cases where you have to come out with decisions where you think that the direction it may be moving the society or the agency is the wrong one; but that is not your job to figure out. The Constitution gives those calls to other people who, by definition, know better, because they are democratically elected. 

I have not understood that, Senator. I have really not understood 

In dissent, alas. 

Well, I am not sure the description of—I did not hear all

Well, I would be surprised if I heard Justice Rehnquist say it only applied to racial

That is right. 

So-called suspect categories. 

Right. That is the current Supreme Court law on the subject and I do not think I should be in the position of saying whether I agree or disagree with the Supreme Court law on the subject, which is not to suggest at all, that I have any doubt about it any more than I necessarily have any doubt about Marbury v. Madison. 

I do not think I should, Senator, because that may well be an issue argued before the Court, and I do not want to be in a position of having, in connection, as a condition of my confirmation 

Giving 

Under current law, there certainly is, yes. 

I know you are not asking me to commit myself. 

I know you are not putting it in the context, how would you vote, but when you are asking that question, in the context of whether you will vote for me to go on the Court—the reason you are asking the question, and the reason I am making my re-58 sponse is clearly so that you will know whether this individual will vote in a way that you think will make him a good Justice.

But that is quite different. 

But that is quite different. I will tell you, you know, my personal beliefs on abortion if 

Senator, the reason I—I do not want to suggest it is a hard question. 

But that is not just a slippery slope; it is a precipice. From then on, I am put to the task of deciding which of those questions are hard ones, and which are not hard ones. So it might still be debatable, and there is no way that I can successfully negotiate my way through such line drawing. I just cannot do it, and, I think the only way to be sure that I am not impairing my ability to be impartial, and to be regarded as impartial in future cases before the Court, is simply to respectfully decline to give an opinion on whether any of the existing law on the Supreme Court is right, or wrong. 

I am happy to answer the last half. I think courts should be, obviously, as concerned about massive societal problems, such as the problem of discrimination in this country as either of the other two branches.

Yes, I have tried to avoid making any public statements on controversial issues of public and political policy since I have been a judge, and I think I should adhere to it. What I wrote in that article is in print, and I guess you can hold it to me as being my views at that time. 

I do not think I should say. As far as a litigant who has to appear before me is concerned, it is troublesome enough to them, I suppose, that I once wrote views on one side or another like that, to reaffirm them after I am a sitting judge who 

Yes. Let's say it that way and 

Yes. I guess if we put it that—it is unknown. Now let's not say that I do not know. 

But if you want me to—if you have concern on the Freedom of Information Act, I have been critical, not of the entire concept of the act, and not indeed of the original act, but just of some aspects of the 1974 amendments.66-852 0 - 8 7 - 360 I think my record, sitting on the District of Columbia circuit, shows that I have applied the act, including those portions of it that I was not enamored of, fairly, and, indeed, if I have any landmark decisions regarding the Freedom of Information Act, I suspect they go in the direction of broadening its application, rather than narrowing. 

Except for—excuse me? 

NO, no. I am saying my decisions on the court, as far as interpreting the Freedom of Information Act is concerned, if any of those were really significant decisions that made significant law, I think the ones that would fall into that category were in the direction of expanding the access under the Freedom of Information Act, rather than narrowing it. 

I can go into chapter and verse on that, but it is very dull stuff, Senator. 

Currently, Senator, I would advocate neither because it is not my business anymore. You write it; I will enforce it. 

Oh, I think it would be wonderful. I do not know how, physically, they could do it and keep up with the 

Not having been up there, I do not know. I could say this, though: that I think, as a lower court judge, what is much more troubling than the fact that the Supreme Court does not decide more cases, is the fact that the cases they do decide are often decided with three and four opinions. So that it is very difficult for the court of appeals judge to know what they are telling us to do. I am not sure which direction it is better to go: to write more opinions or to write fewer opinions, but spend more time getting61 together on one opinion for the whole Court. If you asked—if you took a poll of court of appeals judges, I would bet you they would pick the latter.

Well, let me give you the court of appeals judge's point of view again. The immediate effect of it, of course, is to render judges who are now sitting on the second highest court in the land, judges sitting in the third highest court in the land, and that is not likely to make

AS a policy matter for the country? 

I think it is terrible, and the only question is whether the alternative is more terrible. I do not think anybody is happy about having a four-level court structure. It is more cumbersome. It is more expensive for litigants. 

I think that is so, but I do not think any—I do not think that is telling you anything that is very useful. 

Certainly, if it is to be made a permanent thing, it seems to me you should do it right, and have the appointments the way article III judges are normally appointed to courts—appointment by the President to that court, a nomination by the President to that court, advice and consent of the Senate. 

Yes. I do not know, I think it is a close call, whether 

Yes. I think all the courts have a circuit council, now, that implements the act.

Yes. I think complaints are many—no, I would not say many, but there are complaints and the complaints are processed.I am not sure that the fact that you do not—that the procedure is not very visible to you, or to anyone else, means that the procedure is not working.It is working, and maybe the fact that it is working well simply stops many of these things from coming to public attention when they otherwise would.

Oh, yes. Yes; I do. 

I do not know, Senator. Oh, I am sure, if you say my circuit, or any other circuit, I am sure there have been. 

Well, I think there was one in our circuit, as a matter of fact. 

At least one. 

Well, let me begin by saying I have never been a bad mouther of the bureaucracy. Most of the people I have known in the government, and I have worked in the executive branch in three different positions, most of them are good, hard-working, talented, dedicated people, and trying not to pervert the law but, to the contrary, implement it.The problem I was addressing there was simply the fact it is the same point I was discussing with Senator Kennedy earlier as a matter of fact. It is a problem of excessive delegation. Too many ofthe basic judgments are simply not made in the statute. They are left to be made by the agency that implements it.To the extent that can be avoided, that is the way to go. Otherwise, when you change an administration, without any vote to change the law, suddenly the same law is being administered in a different direction, and that swing can be more or less extreme depending upon how specific the statute itself.

The judiciary stops the swing from going beyond the bounds of the reasonable. But when it is drawn with sufficient vagueness, even the reasonable swing is a pretty broad one. I am sure Congress is aware of the problem. It is a hard one to get a hold onto. 

Those are the only two problems that were raised against the type of veto that was struck down in Chadha. And I suppose if those two requirements, if those two problems were overcome, the problem would be eliminated. But I am not sure you would still call it a legislative veto. 

Well, what matters today is not my view of what I previously wrote, but what the Supreme Court subsequently decided, that is subsequent to what I previously wrote, the Chadha case. 

I think you are presenting to me a situation in which the two defects discussed or identified in Chadha were eliminated on the basis of Chadha

Senator, as I told Senator Kennedy, one of the things I have always been concerned about, and my writings show it, is the problem of excessive delegation by Congress to the agencies. It is an awfully hard problem to deal with. To the extent that there is a device that will enable Congress to review more closely the activities of the agency, that is desirable. There is some way to get proper legislative attention to what the agencies have done by way of implementing earlier statutes.

Right. I understand. I think that is right. 

It is conceivable that had they envisioned the kind of a system that would develop, they would have made provision in the Constitution for a legislative veto. Although, as the Supreme Court has said, they did not. That is what the Supreme Court has said to date. 

I do not recall that I have been confronted with a constitutional challenge to economic regulations during the entire time I sat on the Court I am now sitting on. In fact, the constitutional challenges to economic regulation are pretty rare nowadays.Most of the challenges are on the basis of whether the statute permitted the economic regulation in question.I really would not even know where to begin to grapple with the question you ask. I am sure the experience of my circuit is not different from the experience of most circuits. It is very rare that economic regulation nowadays is challenged on constitutional grounds.

Oh, absolutely. Yes. It would have to be more, and the agency's action would have to be more than wrong headed to be overturned on statutory grounds as well. It can be reasonably wrong headed, and we will approve it. 

I think it is a significant factor in interpreting a statute. I have used it in my opinions. 

Well, I guess I did not repeat that because I 

It is so obvious and 

One, it is so obvious and, two, because we do not normally have a lawsuit in front of us if the language of the statute is clear. Almost invariably, the language of the statute is argued to mean one thing by one side and another thing by another side. And where that is the case, legislative history 

I will use what seems to me reliable legislative history when it is available to be used. The trouble with legislative history, Senator, is figuring out what is reliable and what is not reliable. That is the trouble with it. 

I do not want to pin myself down to a commitment to use any particular type of legislative history or not to use any particular type of legislative history. I am just saying I will not exclude it as a basis for my decisions as I have not in the past. And that it depends on what the significant legislative history is and how genuine a representation of the congressional intent it seems to be.

In the Hirschey case, which you are talking about, it seems so to me because the statute had not been changed. The statute was reenacted unchanged, although it would have been easy to clarify the provision that was ambiguous and that had been the subject of the earlier court decision. What happened, it seemed to me, as best I could read the legislative history, was that the body as a whole had no intent concerning that earlier decision, probably did not even know of that earlier decision. But the committee at most, and perhaps only the committee staff for all one knows, did have views about that opinion and put it in the committee report. But it is, of course, the view of the whole Congress that counts. Now, if the act had been amended in some respect, and if this statement in the committee report were an explanation of why that amendment which came out of the committee was suggested, then it would have had more weight. But here the statute was enacted entirely unamended, and the statement in the committee report seemed to me almost a dictum. It had nothing to do with the bill that was on the floor. 

NO, I said unamended in the respect that had been the source of ambiguity which was the subject of the prior court decision. Yes, the act was amended in other respects, but there was no amendment to which this particular language in the committee report had any relevance. 

Can Congress ratify a court decision? 

Senator, Congress does not act in committee reports. I will say that flat out. Congress acts by passing a law. The only value of the committee reports 

I think that the statement in the committee report would have to be an explanation of something that Congress did in the statute. If it were an explanation of something that Congress did in the statute, and it shows that what Congress did in the statute was based upon thus and such an interpretation of a prior or an acceptance of a prior opinion, then it would be of value. 

In the law? No problem. 

I would not think that was of any relevance unless Congress had done something in the law of which that statement in the committee report was an explanation. 

If I could know that that was what the whole Congress meant, there would be no problem about that at all. But I do not know it when all I see is a single committee report. I cannot tell if that is what the whole Congress meant just from looking at a single committee report where Congress has taken no action on the face of its statute to which that report is somehow tied, which that report explains where it is just passing a law. And the committee that happens to have jurisdiction over that area makes a comment 

My only point, Senator, is I do not think that that gives the committee the right to opine on all matters pertaining to that law, not to those matters which the committee is bringing before the full Congress. And mind you, all I am seeking to do, and it is a problem for any judge using legislative history, is to try to figure out what the intent of the Congress is and to what extent this expresssion, whether it be on the floor by a single Senator, that is a problem sometimes too, or whether it be in a committee report, whether that genuinely represents what the whole body intended. So that we are sure that we are not disenfranchising the Congress and getting you, as a member of the Senate, committed to a position which in feet you knew nothing about and would disagree with. 

Honestly, Senator, I have no criticism whatever about the way Congress tries to get things done. You can get things done any way you like, and that is your affair, and I understand the problems you confront in trying to get it done, the problems that you try to grapple with with the legislative veto, and the kinds of problems you are referring to that can be handled by committee reports.No, I 

I am sorry I did not, Senator. I frankly have gotten a good look at the territory of the law. The one slice of life I did not get a peek at was Hill work, although I dealt with the Hill to some extent when I was in the executive branch. 

NO; I do not think so, Senator, because some of the criticisms that I have made about committee reports, for example, have been made by Members of the Senate. You certainly could not explain it that way as far as their criticism is concerned. 

Well, I am amenable 

Yes; I think it has a content. I would be surprised if what Judge Posner meant was not simply that at least at the margins, and it is usually at the margins that we are talking when we have litigation in front of us, people disagree as to what justice requires.But, you know, I believe it has content and fairness has content. 

He should not have put it that way. He should have known better. 

I am sure he does not mean anything different either, Senator. 

Yes; I was. 

Yes; I did. 

IS this public knowledge, Senator? I do not know. If it is not, I think I probably should not disclose it unless the President wants me to. The President vetoed the amendments. And I think he set forth in his veto message what his principal concerns were. The major one was the requirement of the amendments that courts review de novo justifications for withholding national security. 

YOU come to the same question that do I now 

I do not have any views on such matters now, Senator. 

I have no compunction in answering at all, except for the attorney-client relationship that I had

I think it comes to answering the same thing, and I really—I think I should not in deference to the attorney-client relationship I had with the

I criticized those amendments, Senator. I think you have in front of you—I mean I am in print as having criticized those amendments.I might also add, however, that when I was Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, I testified before Congress in favor of proposed amendments to the Freedom of Information Act, and in favor of proposed application of the Freedom of Information Act by the agencies that were in the direction of liberalizing some disclosures. So I

Yes. 

Yes. 

NO; none whatever, Senator. I have upheld it as it is currently written. And I am not sure whether Congress simply overrode the veto or made—did they make one minor change before they overrode the veto? 

OK. 

That is right. I suppose that is right. They did override and not pass the amended bill. 

But you must have misheard the latter. Some of the most—I can name a couple—some of the most complex cases I have had were FOIA cases. I think 

Both. But probably more often the law. Church of Scientology is one of the cases. I commend it to your attention as an incredibly complex opinion, both the panel opinion of the three judges, which I wrote, and the en bane court opinion which I wrote. It is one of the most complex pieces of statutory interpretation that I had to set my hands to.

I would not—if you ask me for an example of a vague statute, the Freedom of Information Act is what I would—is not what I would immediately pick out. There are some areas where, after I guess a couple of decades of experience now, the statute could be made more precise. But if you ask me for a vague statute, that is not what I would mention as a prototype.

I do not know what you mean by a vague—almost any piece of legislation you can say that there are some areas that could be more specific. There are certainly some portions of FOIA that are like that. How specific Congress wants to be, you know, is always a question in every statute.The problem with FOIA, Senator, is that unlike most statutes that Congress passes, it is not addressed to a single agency so, you know, it is addressed to OSHA or to the Food and Drug Administration. So that with such a statute even if it has a certain amount of vagueness, you are going to get a standardized interpretation by one single agency.The problem with FOIA is that it goes out there to every agency in the executive branch. So to the extent that there is any vagueness at all in FOIA, that vagueness is going to have to be resolved at the district court level, because each agency might resolve the vagueness somewhat differently.Now, the Justice Department tries to—at least it used to in the days when I was there—try to get the agencies to come up with a uniform interpretation. But I think you can say that there are special needs for precision when you have a statute that is a cross-cutting statute.

I think that is so. Although most of those are in much more detail—I have no particular—I do not know what you are driving at is what I am trying to say.I suspect that there are some legislative proposals to 

NO; Senator, I was asked that question earlier, I think when you were out of the room. And one of the things I said then, and I stand by it now, is that to the extent that I made significant law in the FOIA field, I have had a lot of FOIA cases—I do not know what the score is—but to the extent I have made signifi-cant law, I think it is in the direction of broadening access rather than restricting access.

I understand that. 

Yes; I do, Senator 

NO; I was not, Senator. 

NO; I did not, Senator. I had not been counsel for AT&T—I mean I had not had a longstanding attorney-client relationship with them or anything like that. I had simply done a oneshot job of consulting with them I guess 2 years or so before I went on the bench, and the compensation may have been just the very year I went on the bench. And once before I had taught a seminar for some of their executives about communications law one afternoon. That was the only association I had with them. It seemed to me that 2 or 3 years disqualification from AT&T matters would be more than enough to eliminate any appearance of impropriety. In all of these cases, of course, it is not just a matter of an interest on just one side and no interest on the other side. It is a cost to the court when I have to disqualify myself, of course, and it is unfair to the litigants. If there is no proper reason for disqualification, they are entitled to get a shot at the full bench of judges and not just hit the full bench minus one or two. So I decided that I would recuse myself for a period of 3 years. I informed the clerk of the court that I would not participate in any AT&T matters. So that means that I am, as a practical matter, disqualified from all common carrier litigation which is a good chunk of D.C. Circuit business. After 3 years, I instructed the clerk to put me back in the pool for AT&T cases. 

NO, not at all, Senator. And I do not know anybody else that agrees with him either. I have had nobody that has told me that he or she thought that 3 years' worth of disqualification for that kind of prior financial connection with AT&T would not be more than enough. 

All I can say, Senator, is that I am thinking very hard about disqualifying myself from it. They are the same films, not the same parties in the litigation, but they are the same films, not just the same issue, but the very same films involved. I think I will probably disqualify myself, recuse myself.

I would not want to argue to me in that case. 

"In for a nickel, in for a dime," I may as well, yes, I will recuse myself, Senator. I feel uncertain enough about it that I do not think I ought to go near it. 

I never watch the films that are part of litigation. 

I do not think so, Senator. 

NO. 

Well, I do not know the extent of the difference. All I know is that the intelligence community so-called did not like the Levy guidelines at all, and that the Smith guidelines were thought to be the more acceptable. I know there are differences. I do not know what they are. 

I have been out of that field for a long time except that I know that some of my former associates in the intelligence community clearly did not love the Levy guidelines. And I thought that some of the impetus for the changes was from those people.

I am sure Mary has now gone on from the Office of Legal Counsel to I think a whole new post just dealing with intelligence matters. 

Did I have any? I do not think I had any occasion to consider it, Senator, because I do not think there is any question that Congress does. 

I am not aware that it was ever in question that Congress had authority to act in the field. 

Oh, I am sure it was all over by then, Senator. 

Not that I recall, Senator. Not that I recall. 

That was the speech, Senator. 

I am glad Senator Grassley is not here, Senator. 

Senator, unless I am mistaken, it was both before the Senate and the House. I think it was before Judiciary in both Houses. But I am sure I can get that for you. I am sure it is all a matter of public

I think mostly it was executive privilege in general; the whole doctrine of executive privilege was then at issue with regard to a number of different matters that the Congress had on the stove with the executive.And I do not recall right now any specific issue of executive privilege, where it involved the withholding of any particular document or set of documents and where I was testifying.But I can get it for you. I am sure there is a record of it. All that testimony

NO, at the time, Senator, I remember—I think I was on a panel. I think it was a panel before a committee concerning whether there was any such thing. This was before the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Nixon, so there had been no court decision which, in so many words, had affirmed the existence of such an animal as executive privilege. And it was a matter of great interest to the Congress at that time.I was on a panel, as I recall, with Raoul Berger from Harvard who was an opponent of the existence of any executive privilege.

NO, I did not serve under President Nixon. He was out of office before I was confirmed.

Yes, Senator, but not in the manner in which you describe. The way it was limited was not describing the subject matters, but rather, describing the procedure for its assertion. And the procedure was a rigorous one. It could not ultimately be asserted by an executive officer without, as I recall, the approval of—I think it required the President's personal approval before it could be asserted.So it is a big deal, the executive branch does not take it lightly.Now, very often, when an agency is asked for documents, it will say, we are reluctant to turn them over. And there is a preliminary process of negotiation. But if it really comes down to hard core, adamant positions on both sides that cannot be resolved, before the agency can say, we will not comply with this subpoena for the documents, we will not turn them over, the procedures required that there be—as I recall it—approval by the President with the advice of the Attorney General on the matter.And as far as I know, I am quite confident that that is still in effect, or something like it. We did not take it lightly, Senator. It is always a regrettable confrontation between the two branches.

Well, I can give you my view of what it has been up to now, anyway, or at least in this century. The fact is, it seems to me, that the primary defender of the constitutional balance, the Federal Government versus the States—maybe "versus" is not the way to put it—but the primary institution to strike the right balance is the Congress. It is a principle of the Constitution that there are certain responsibilities that belong to the State and some that belong to the Federal Government, but it is essentially the function of the Congress—the Congress, which takes the same oath to uphold and defend the constitution that I do as a judge, to have that constitutional prescription in mind when it enacts the laws.And I think the history of this century, at least, shows that by and large those congressional determinations will be respected by the courts.

Certainly as a member of the legislature, Senator, that would be my view. I think my writings show that, that I take seriously one of the checks and balances, which are the ultimate protection of individual liberties in the Constitution—one of them is the fact that you have not just a unified, centralized Government, but also 50 independent States, and that the work of Government is divided between those two entities.As to whether that question is of much relevance to me in the vast majority if not all of the cases I have to decide, that is quite a different issue. I think what I am saying is that on the basis of the court's past decisions, at any rate, the main protection for that is in the policymaking area, is in the Congress. The court's struggles to prescribe what is the proper role of the Federal Government visa-vis the State have essentially been abandoned for quite a while.

I think that is right, Senator. I think what the Supreme Court decisions on the subject show is that it is very hard to find a distinct justiciable line between those matters that are appropriate for the States and those that are appropriate for the Federal Government, that finding that line is much easier for a legislator than for a court, and by and large the courts have not interfered.I expect there will be more arguments urging that they do so in the future, and I will of course keep an open mind.

I wrote an article some years ago, Senator, in which I essentially supported the concept of a corps of administrative law judges, but the quid pro quo for establishing the corps— right now, of course, each agency has its own judges; the corps proposal is that there be a central depository of administrative law judges, in ALJ court, in effect, which would decide cases from all agencies with maybe specialized panels of that court. I wrote a piece that thought that that concept was worth exploring, provided that what went along with it would be the understanding that all administrative law judges would not all be the same grade level, as they now essentially are in each agency. And in most agencies, it is a very high level.It seemed to me in that article, at least, that what we should be moving for is a career administrative judiciary, which is what most other legal systems have, so that you could—many of the administrative matters that need to be decided do not take as experienced, as seasoned, as knowledgeable, as expert a judge as a major ratemaking case, and it would make sense to have judges of varying degrees of experience and hence varying grade levels who can work their way up through the corps and ultimately be assigned to the most difficult cases.

I said, Senator, it is a pillar of our system. I do not want to say that anything is a settled issue as far as I am concerned. If somebody wants to come in and challenge Marbury v. Madison, I will listen to that person. But it is obviously a pillar of our current system.Whether I would be likely to kick away Marbury v. Madison, given not only what I have just said, but also what I have said concerning my respect for the principle of stare decisis, I think you will have to judge on the basis of my record as a judge in the court of appeals, and your judgment as to whether I am, I suppose, on that issue sufficiently intemperate or extreme.But I really do not want to say with respect to any decision that I would not listen to a litigant who wants to challenge it. I invite84 you and urge you to make your judgment. I think the question you are asking is quite a relevant question, and I would not want to confirm anybody that I believed would destroy certain decisions. But I think the way you have to come to that judgment is on the basis of my past record as a thoughtful moderate lawyer and judge, and on the basis of my writings and my records in the past.I do not want to be in the position of saying as to any case that I would not overrule it.

I suppose everybody considers himself a "moderate", Senator, I do.

Well, maybe everybody does not. I do, anyway. 

It is certainly an essential part of the system that we now have. 

Senator, I am afraid I am at the same place on that that I was on Marbury y. Madison. In fact, I think ex parte McCardle was probably described too generously as being a decision of the Supreme Court that seemed to indicate on the one hand that the jurisdiction could be taken awav entirely, and then United States v. Klein suggesting to the contrary. Ex parte McCardle actually did not quite go even so far as to allow the jurisdiction to be taken away. It allowed the habeas corpus jurisdiction to be taken away under one statute, and the Court went to some pains in the opinion to point out that this is not to say that there is no habeas corpus relief at all. There is just no habeas corpus relief under the particular statute as to which Congress had withdrawn it.So I do not think that there is an opinion on the books that is even as possibly antagonistic to your view as ex parte McCardle has been described.I share your concern with the ability of Congress to remove jurisdiction entirely from the Supreme Court. It is obviously a jolt to the system, to put it mildly. I just do not want to be, and do not think I properly can be, in a position of saying that I would rule unconstitutional any piece of legislation that does that. Again, I think I must ask you to judge what I am likely to do on the basis of your estimation of my legal views, my loyalty to the meaning of the Constitution as you understand it.

I think the jurisdiction of the Court on any matter, is obviously a pillar of the system that we have.

I think it is very hard, Senator, when you are dealing with someone that does not have a track record, where you cannot read that individual's opinions in the past dealing with the important features of the Constitution and of statutes, seeing how that person deals with the materials, seeing that person's veneration for the important principles that you are concerned about.In my case, you have 4 years of that; you have extensive writings on administrative law and constitutional law from the years when I was a professor; you have testimony and statements that I made when I was in the executive branch.I am as sympathetic to your problem as you said you are to mine. I think at least in the present circumstances, as I see my responsibilities anyway, my problem with answering the easy question, Senator, is that what is an easy question for you may be a hard question for somebody else. And as I commented earlier, it is not a slippery slope; it is a precipice. Marbury v. Madison, we all agree about, jurisdiction of the court; it goes from one to the next. And I am very unable to say this is the line where it suddenly has become a doubtful question. That indeed is prejudicing future litigants, who should be able to come up and argue that we haveseen—you know, Plessy v. Ferguson might have been considered a settled question at one time, but a litigant should have been able to come in and say, "It is wrong," and get a judge who has not committed himself to a committee as a condition of his confirmation to adhering to it. That is what I am struggling with, and I hope you have enough material to judge my reasonableness and my fidelity to the Constitution to assure you that on matters that you consider "rockbed" and that are "rockbed", I would not pull the structure down.

I will hear a litigant in my present court on any question, Senator, and I have heard some fairly far—out arguments. In the Supreme Court, I will not have to do that, because we have some option as to whether we decide to take a case or not. But in theory, I think I have to make myself available to any argument.

I certainly will. 

I think you have finally gone over the edge of absurdity so much that I have to say: Of course not. 

I am on the precipice, you are telling me, now. 

Well, I hope not, but I do not want you to think less of me for failure to answer. I thought about this issue a long time, because the one thing you know is going to come up in every judicial confirmation hearing, in particular Supreme Court confirmation hearing, is this issue of what questions can you answer; and it is a constant problem, and I realize that some nominees have tried to answer some questions and not answered the other. I thought long and hard about that problem, and I came to this con-elusion, that if indeed it is obvious, then you do not need an answer, because your judgment of my record and my reasonableness and my moderation will lead you to conclude, heck, it is so obvious, anybody that we think is not a nutty-nutty would have to come out that way.If, on the other hand, it is not obvious, then I am really prejudicing future litigants. So taking all that balance into account, I just concluded that the only safe position that I can take in conscience is to simply not say that there is any particular case regarding which I would absolutely vote against a litigant who urges a position that is contrary to it.

Well, no, no. I think you have to look at my writings and ask me about my writings and test those writings to see what I meant about some elements of them. I have been questioned about cases that I have written, and I am happy to respond to answers about what they meant, and why what I said in them or what I did in them is not bad. I have been very open on those, and will continue to be. It is just predictions as to how I will vote in the future that I am drawing the line at.

Yes; I will say that is an accepted part of current law.

They certainly have been clearly settled by the Supreme Court.

Indeed. It would be quite a jolt to the existing system to suddenly discover that those series of protections against State actions do not exist.

Indeed. 

That is what the cases have held, and it would be a massive change to go back on them.

Marbury v. Madison is a pillar; if that is a pillar, I do not know what—I would just say it is a very accepted and settled part of our current system, and it would be an enormous change to go back. 

Can I talk about what I meant when I wrote that article, instead of putting it in the context of what I would do?

Right. The point I was trying to make, Senator, was simply this. There is an ongoing debate that has always been ongoing, but it is more publicly known now, about strict constructionism versus a more evolutionary theory of the Constitution. And I am speaking particularly about decisions of the court that give content to provisions of the Constitution that are not sufficiently explicit to strike down particular practices. If a practice that constitutes plainly racial discrimination existed in all the States, it would make no difference whether it existed from the beginning of the 14th amendment down to the present. If it is facially contraryto the language, obviously, there is no problem. And that is not the situation I was referring to.I was referring to the situation where a court is giving content to in particular the due process clause of the 14th amendment, what particular substantive protections that might incorporate. And what I felt, and it was the point of that article, was that the judges have authority to give such content, no doubt, but I do not know how a judge intuits that a particular practice is contrary to our most fundamental beliefs, to the most fundamental beliefs of our society, when it is one that was in existence when the Constitutional provision in question was adopted and is still in existence.Now, when I say a practice that is in existence, I am not referring to a Gallup poll. I am referring to the understandings of the people, reflected in the legislation that their representatives have adopted. I would find it very difficult, I was saying in that article, to strike down a provision on the basis of substantive due process in particular where it is a provision that State legislatures generally adopted at the time the 14th amendment was passed and continue to generally adopt. When you leave that point of departure, you are left to the individual preferences of the judges. And I am not comfortable with imposing my moral views on the society. I need something to look to. And what I look to is the understanding of the people.A strict constructionist would say use only the understanding at the time of the 14th amendment. The evolutionist would say no, the understanding today as well. Whichever of those two you use— and as I said in some earlier questioning, I am a little wishy-washy on that point—but whichever of the two you use, it seems to me that either one or the other has to reflect the new right that you have found. If it was neither these when the 14th amendment was adopted nor is there today, then it seems to me, I was saying in that article, I am making it up.

Well, maybe I should not take it on frontally, but let me do it. I would even—it is true in a way, it seems to me, that a constitution has to have ultimately majoritarian underpinnings. To be sure a constitution is a document that protects against future democratic excesses. But when it is adopted, it is adopted by democratic process. That is what legitimates it.And the point I was making in that article is if the majority that adopted it did not believe this unspecified right, which is not reflected clearly in the language, if their laws at the time do not reflect that that right existed, nor do the laws at the present date reflect that the society believes that right exists, I worry about my deciding that it exists. I worry that I am not reflecting the most fundamental, deeply felt beliefs of our society, which is what a constitution means, but rather, I am reflecting the most deeply felt beliefs of Scalia, which is not what I want to impose on the society.

You just made a statement, but I do not disagree with your concern. All I can say to it is that the views I expressed certainly do not reflect the notion that I will be swayed by Gallup polls, or by current public opinion. "To the contrary, if, there is an established constitutional right that has been set forth in the Constitution, or, even if not set forth very explicitly, is clearly established by the practices of the society, I would assuredly not allow the mere fact that the current society, inflamed by one passion, prejudice, or another, wants to stomp it out. I would not allow that to affect my judgment; quite to the contrary. 

I do not mind taking unpopular positions, Senator. 

Yes, sir. 

Well, I certainly agree, Senator, that a judge should not be a member of a club that practices invidious discrimination. I think the issue is whether that was invidious discrimination or not. I certainly would not belong to a club that practiced racial discrimination, which I do not think there is any basis for socialization on the basis of race. That there is any difference in company on the basis of the color of a person's skin or ethnic background. 

I knew that it was a men's club, and what I was going to go on to say is that I do not consider that an invidious discrimination. I think there are a lot of other people who likewise do not consider it invidious discrimination. I realize there are those that disagree, that do not like organizations like the Knights of Columbus, or for that matter, the Boy Scouts, and think that that should not be an all-male organization. I happen not to have felt that way and thus was a member of the Cosmos Club. When I first joined it, Senator, was when I first came up to Washington to work in the executive branch. I lived in the club for about 6 months while my family was still in Charlottesville. One of the facilities of living there was that it was a men's club. Now I understand there are people who feel differently about it. I am sensitive to their views toward the end of the period that I was a membership of the club—that I was a member in the club. I was especially uncomfortable because I know that some of the judges on my court took the opposite view of whether there should be clubs of that sort. I happen to disagree. I am no longer a member. That is all I can say. 

Would you read the quote where I use the 

I am fully aware of that sensitivity, Senator, which was why, when I began the story, I made it clear that Tonto's wisdom was always Solomonic, but it was disguised between what I referred to there as a "Hollywood Indian dialect." That is a disparaging term. I am fully aware that Indians do not talk that way. It is how Hollywood portrayed them. I thought I made it very clear in what I wrote, that Indians do not talk that way, but that is the way Hollywood wrongfully portrays them. Now if that is not enough of a disclaimer and the story has to be stricken from everyone's repertoire, I think that would be a great loss. And it does not work in non-Hollywood Indian. It really does not. 

Personally, Senator, you know, I have no personal objection to it. There was nothing I did at the Justice Department that was other than honorable. I would be less than honest if I did not say, that having worked in the Office of Legal Counsel, and defended its prerogatives for 3 Vz years or so, I am concerned about the institution, about the effect that such a probing, or more specifically, the awareness of the fact that whatever the head of the Office of Legal Counsel writes will henceforth, should he ever be subjected to questioning in connection with a confirmation—whichis very likely because most heads of the Office of Legal Counsel, or many of them, at least, go on to later Government positions.I think it would be harmful to the Office, if it is known that everything he puts down on paper by way of advice to the Attorney General, or to the agencies, will be made public.I fear that it may make his advice less frank, less forthright than it otherwise would be. That is purely an institutional objection. It is up to the President to defend that institution. Personally, I have—I am not ashamed of anything I did while I was there.

I have no personal objection, sir. 

I share the perception that there is a problem, Senator. I am not entirely sure what to do about it. To some extent the problem feeds on itself, of course. The story of the fellow sitting in a train, and the gentleman next to him asks him what he does, and he says, "I'm a lawyer," and the fellow says, "Gee, what do you know. We used to have a lawyer in my home town. Poor devil, he could hardly make a living. Then another lawyer moved in, and now they're both doing fine." To some extent, the very increase in the number of lawyers creates yet greater litigiousness. I do not know whether it is—it does seem to be a trend that is beginning to slow down a little bit. The answers that are being sought are alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, other than the courts, and my understanding is that there is some success with those mechanisms. Unfortunately, the resort to those mechanisms is in itself something of an admission of failure. People want to resort to them because the courts are too crowded, it takes too long to get justice there, and it is too expensive, which is a sad commentary. I am afraid I just do not have an answer. I share your perception of the problem. 

NO. I did not.

Well, we discussed that article a little earlier, and as I said there, it was addressing mainly the policy of affirmative action, not its constitutionality. Whether it was desirable I—that is of course a disagreement concerning the means to the end. I do not think—I hope there is no doubt about my commitment to—or there should be no doubt about my commitment to a society without discrimination. I am—if the notion there is that I am hostile to the laws that seek to eliminate that, that is simply not true.I am, in a way, having any animosity toward racial minorities, in my case would be a form of self-hate. I am a member of a racial minority myself, suffered, I expect, some minor discrimination in my years; nothing compared to what other racial groups have suffered. But it does not take a whole lot to make you know that it is bad stuff.My wife's mother remembers the days—she is a Fitzgerald from Boston. I wish Senator Kennedy were here to know that. But she remembers the days when there were signs in Boston that said: "No Irish need apply." I find all of that terribly offensive.I am a product of the melting pot in New York, grew up with people of all religious and ethnic backgrounds. When I lived in your State, Senator, I did not live in a monochrome suburb, but I lived in Hyde Park, and my kids went to school, a school that was at least 40 percent, maybe more than that, black; not white. My kids socialized with and dated people of all races.I have absolutely no racial prejudices, and I think I am probably at least as antagonistic as the average American, and probably much more so toward racial discrimination. Beyond that, I can just say that I disagreed with affirmative action, in that article, as the way to eliminate it. The side effects that I saw, that could be worse than what the particular affirmative action program would eliminate.In any case, those policy views will not inform my decisions from the Supreme Court, as I do not think they have informed my opinions on the court of appeals.I think that it would be a different matter if those opinions showed any racial hostility, or hostility toward the laws, and I do not think they do.

Fundamentally, fundamentally wrong in—you mean on legal—or morally wrong?

NO; I think that it is a good thing. Certainly, in my own hiring practices, I have tried to have a mix of people among my law clerks, and elsewhere. No, I cannot say that that is 

That article actually came from a speech that I gave which became an article in the Washington University Law Review. I had policy views; I have tried not to have them—not have any public ones anyway, since I have been a judge. So I would like not to comment on it as a policy matter. I just want to note that there is a difference between the first hypothetical you gave me and that. And the difference is this. It is the President saying, you know, it seems to me to be good to hire a Puerto Rican or whatever as his own voluntary decision; and, on the other hand, saying the President or anybody must hire an Italian or a Puerto Rican or a certain percentage of them. The difference is that when you adopt the latter situation, you are automatically excluding some people from consideration. Now, that makes a difference just as a policy matter. So it's a slightly different question. I guess that what my Washington University piece would say is that in the days when I had policy views I didn't think it was a good idea. That has nothing to do with whether I would enforce it vigorously if it's passed by Congress. 

I'd be happy to talk about the three cases, if you'dlike. What three was he referring to?

Well, that is the one case, one of very few cases, Ican't talk about because it's still before our court on petition forrehearing, but I can at least note that it was not my opinion. Itwas the opinion of Judge McKinnon in which I joined.Now, the holding of the case was on a factual matter. I think Ihad better not try to defend the holding at all, except to note thatthe opinion was not mine, it was an opinion in which I joined.

I think sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.The fact that I joined an opinion against the press doesn't proveanything.What are the other opinions, Senator? I think I can probablyguess.

Evans and Novak v. Oilman. Senator Hatch said afew words about that case earlier. It really, as I think he pointedout, is a sort of damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't situation. Icould have been criticized as being against Marxists had I come outthe other way. It was a suit by a Marxist against a conservativecolumnist.The fact is that my dissent in that case—it's a dissent that theyare referring to—was joined in by, if I recollect correctly, ChiefJudge Robinson. The position that I took was joined in by JudgeRobinson, Judge Wright, Judge Edwards, and Judge Wald. Myopinion itself was joined in by Judge Edwards and Judge Wald.I don't think that that is any indication of a bias against the first amendment, unless all of those judges are deemed to have the same bias, which I would doubt.The specific issue in the case was whether a particular—it was a very narrow issue. We were all in agreement on the basic principles of first amendment law, that it was libelous if it was not an opinion; it was not libelous if it was an opinion.And the issue before the court was whether the statement that this Marxist professor, who was up for appointment as the chairman of the department of political science at the University of Maryland—the statement that he had no status in his profession, was not taken seriously by his colleagues, something to that effect, whether that was libel. I thought that that was not a statement of opinion but a statement of fact, that he was not highly regarded by his colleagues. And, in fact, in traditional libel law, the classic libel is to say that you are not regarded as competent by your professional associates.I just don't believe there is anything in there that is antagonistic to the first amendment. I think the opinion that I wrote, which largely responded to Judge Bork's concurrence, had a statement which was quoted bv a columnist to the effect that public figures getting a good amount of bumping from the press was fulsomely assured by New York Times v. Sullivan. It somehow came out in the press as though I was saying that the freedom of the press was fulsomely assured by New York Times v. Sullivan. I wasn't saying that at all. I was saying that the fact that public figures will get a good amount of bumping was fulsomely assured, by which I mean assured not only sufficiently but more than sufficiently.I don't think there is anything in that statement that demonstrates an antagonism toward the first amendment.And the last case, Senator, was what? I would welcome any opportunity to

I suppose it doesn't give any indication how I'm going to vote on any particular case to say that I don't think that statement would be much altered today, and I doubt whether there are very many people who would disagree with it, with the possible exception of—well, even the "rational"—the decisions are very difficult to reconcile with one another, the decisions that are on the books. The rationale that is adopted in one case does not fit entirely well with the cases that have been cited in the past. I think that's common ground among the people who discuss the establishment clause cases. Whether the cases are thought of as being right or98 wrong, I think there is general agreement that it is one of the messiest areas of constitutional jurisprudence.

Basic traditions? 

I'm not sure what you mean by "basic traditions," Senator. 

Well, I think what's sound is that—what's accepted—the problem in the area, Senator, is a problem that largely arises because of a natural conflict between the establishment clause and the freedom-of-religion clause. Both of those interests are very important. People ought to be able to practice their religion freely, and yet the Government cannot establish religion. So you get cases like the case of the Jehovah's witness, who, being a Sabbatarian, wants to have Saturday off instead of Sunday, and wants to draw unemployment compensation when she's been offered a job that requires work on Saturday and turned it down. And the way the Court resolved the case was to say it violated the freedom-of-religion clause for a State not to allow her to draw unemployment compensation simply because she refused to accept a job that would require her to work on Saturday. Well, yes, that does protect freedom of religion, but, on the other hand, doesn't that somehow amount to an establishment of religion to have the State make a special rule to accommodate the religious belief of this Sabbatarian? That's the problem that runs throughout these cases, and that's the reason they are very hard to figure. On some occasions the Court seems to be giving more weight to the freedom-of-religion section of the first amendment, on other occasions it seems to be giving more weight to the establishment clause section. If I had to pick an area in the whole area of constitutional law that is in an unsettled state, I think that that's the one. I think many commentators would agree. 

It sounds like the least of the evils offered, Senator, doesn't it? There are problems with all of them.It's very hard to envision a court getting together for such a purpose, to select one of its number to be the designee or for the Supreme Court to select particular individual judges. It amounts to the kind of designation of ability and primacy that I would—I certainly wouldn't want to do it as a member of a court of appeals, I wouldn't particularly want to do it as a member of the Supreme Court either.Your judgment on that is as good as mine, Senator. I guess that having the Chief Justice do it is the least evil—but there are problems with that, too. It doesn't give you the spectrum of opinion that having a body of people do it would.Some questions don't have any good answers, Senator. 

Well, giving this answer now that I'm a judge does make it sound as though it's self-pleading, but I had the same view before I became a judge. It is a cumbersome process—I think it should be a cumbersome process. I think it's the major protection for the independence of the judiciary. The bases of impeachment are somewhat vague, and the bases that past Congresses have sought to use in the most prominent cases are pretty vague. It seems to me that it is an important protection to the independence of a judge to be able to decide cases as he sees them, that removing him is a lot of trouble. 

I think much more so. It's not as though the framers didn't know that they were establishing something that was very cumbersome and very difficult. They were out of step with many of the Colonies at the time in what they provided for the judiciary.One of the major debates at the Convention was the provision on the judiciary, giving them life tenure, for example.Our Federal judiciary is out of step with the States in many other respects. Many States have mandatory retirement ages, as you know; many States still, I believe, have election of judges. And all of those things were considered and rejected in favor of an extraordinarily strong—extraordinarily, more so than most of the Colonies then and more so than most of the States now—an extraordinarily strong and independent Federal judiciary. I think it was a conscious decision by the framers, and I happen to think that it was a good one.But I understand, especially at a time when the Congress has plenty else to do, to have to sit in a trial of a judge is cumbersome.

That isn't quite what I said, Senator. I said that I regarded the two as quite different, and I would think that a club that discriminates on the basis of race or on the basis of religion, that would be invidious discrimination. I think the jury's out on whether it's invidious discrimination to have a men's club. That's what I said. 

I think that there is room for disagreement on whether a social club that is a men's club or a women's club is invidious to the other sex. 

I can see that, Senator, yes. 

Well, you know, there is sort of affirmative and negative discrimination, I suppose. I have been a member of Italian-American clubs, members who share a common heritage. The exclusion of others is not an invidious exclusion at all. And likewise religious clubs, Knights of Columbus and whatnot; they exclude people of other religions, not invidiously, but just because they get together to celebrate what they have in common. I think that's the key to it, whether the exclusion is an invidious one or not. 

Yes, I think that would be invidious. 

Yes, sir. 

Let me try, Senator. I am deeply mistrustful of my ability, without any guidance other than my own intuition, to say what are the deepest and most profound beliefs of our society. And that's what it means to say that something is constitutionally required. It is in accordance with the deepest and most profound beliefs of our society. I find it difficult to come to the conclusion that something qualifies for that description when neither at the time the constitutional provision in question was enacted, was it in fact the practice of the society, as demonstrated by the laws the society enacted, nor at the present time is it that way. Now, I can understand—and you get into the debate between the evolutionists and the original-meaning types when you say, well, what if everybody now thinks it's awful and there are no laws on the books of this sort today, but there were in 1789, so it must be constitutional—it seems to me that's a good debate. But I find it very difficult to say that it is contrary to our most fundamental beliefs when both in 1789 and today all of the States permit the practice in question, whatever it may be. Once you don't give me that to hang onto, Senator, I worry that I am left with nothing to tell me what are our most profound beliefs except my own little voice inside. And I do not want to govern this society on the basis of that. 

I think that's in effect asking me to rule on cases. I can say that the Supreme Court has held that there is such a thing as a right of privacy. But they haven't tied it to the 9th amendment. As far as I know, there is no Supreme Court holding that rests any right exclusively on the 9th amendment. They may include the 9th in a litany of amendments from which various penumbras emanate, and the 9th was among them. 

I don't think I could answer that, Senator, without violating the line I've tried to hold. 

I can tell you that that is what certainly a number of Supreme Court opinions now say. 

YOU know, somebody may come in and say, just as somebody might come in and say Marbury v. Madison was wrong, that it doesn't exist. I do not want to be put in the position of having to tell, you know, I'm sorry, I believe in the right of privacy, because I told the committee, in connection with considering my nomination, that I believe in it. 

Senator, I beg to differ. There have been scholarly criticisms of the whole notion of right to privacy. 

And it's not at all inconceivable that that criticism will be reflected in a brief before the Supreme Court, and I don't 

I don't think you'll find it in 

I don't recall having said that, Senator. 

It's very hard to answer—you began this line of questioning by answering me never mind what the right of privacy consists of. I can't answer that question without knowing what you mean by the right of privacy.

NO, I'll give you that, Senator. 

Let's see if yours is the same as mine—I have one here, too. [Laughter.] 

NO, I think there is no doubt in my mind of that. 

No. Yes, I think that's a fair statement.

I agree with the statement that longstanding casesare more difficult to overrule than recent cases.

Well, in every case, Senator, you have to find thatit's simply wrong, that it's not a correct interpretation of the Con-stitution.

YOU begin with that. But, as I've said, some casesthat are so old, even if you waved in my face a document provingthat they were wrong when decided in 1803, I think you'd have tosay, sorry, too late.

Well, that's not 1803. All I can say is

I don't want to mislead you into thinking it's justa function of time.

The basic reason I resigned, Senator—I think I described earlier how I had first become a member, I used the club a lot, I lived there for 6 months, I used it a lot when I was in Chicago because when I came up to Washington to testify or to do any other business, which I often did, since ad law was my field, I would stay there. I came to use it very infrequently when I was a member of the court that I now sit on, which is at the other side of town. So I found I was having lunch there maybe twice a year, and I quickly calculated that it was costing me something like $250 a lunch. It didn't seem to me to be worth the trouble. 

It is an expensive lunch. 

I would hesitate to say that, Senator. I don't know whether that alone would have done it. I told you that I was uncomfortable at doing something, which, although I thought it was perfectly OK, was offensive to friends whose feelings I am concerned about. But I can't say that that alone was the reason. 

Yes. If I could create the world anew, I suppose I still would, but I will no more be able to create the world anew106 when I am sitting on the Supreme Court than I could when I was sitting on the court of appeals, if I ever get to sit up there.And if the burden of your question is whether I would utterly ignore legislative history on the Supreme Court, the answer is no, I would not.

Yes, right. 

Senator, as a general matter, I am not as enamored of committee reports as authoritative expositors as some judges are. I may say, by the way, that my view on that matter is not idiosyncratic. There are—my impression is that a number of judges have come to feel that the process has gotten out of whack; that, to some extent, because the courts have used committee reports to such degree, the committee reports are no longer as accurate a device as they used to be. It is sort of the phenomenon of when the cameras go—it is sort of the phenomenon of your never being able to look at yourself in the mirror and see what you really look like because you know you are looking at yourself, and it is the same thing with committee reports. Once it was clear that the courts were going to use them all the time, they certainly became a device not to inform the rest of the body as to what the intent of the bill was, but rather they became avowedly a device to make some legislative history and tell the courts how to hold this way or that way. Once that happens, they become less reliable as a real indication of what the whole body thought it was voting on. That is why I am sorry if it does not please some of the Senators, but I just have to say that I am more suspicious of them than some judges may be. 

I doubt very much, Senator, whether I would not use committee reports at all when I am on the Supreme Court, but I do think that the view I am expressing of greater skepticism than has been brought to bear upon them in the past is, unless I mistake my guess, the wave of the future.I think the courts sometimes are beginning to feel that they are being

It is not the quality of the report or the work that has gone into them, both of which are fine. The essential ingredient, however, is for the court to know that when the Senate voted on the bill, that is what the full Senate meant.And if there is some way that the actual attention of the whole body to that particular item, which very often is such a subsidiary item that one really has to wonder whether the notion that the full Senate had in mind this one statement in a multipage report— whether that is not utterly fictional, and if it is fictional, then it does not really represent the intent of the Senate when they voted. That is the problem.

Oh, you are right; that may have been too broad a statement. In the context in which I was speaking, it is the distinctive threat with relationship to the judicial process of our time, I think, if there is one failing, and perhaps in our entire governmental process bearing upon the relationship among the three branches.

I am sorry that article has gotten the most attention. It is, doubtless, the—of all my articles, it is the one I am least proud of. I am not ashamed of it, but it was a couple-of-page thing in a rather popular, as opposed to scholarly publication—probably not even very popular, but at least not scholarly. 

Well, it is where I start from, Senator. I think the first step is to—and I use the term "original meaning" rather than "original intent," which is maybe something of a quibble, but I think that one is bound by the meaning of the Constitution to the society to which it was promulgated. And if somebody should discover that the secret intent of the framers was quite different from what the words seem to connote, it would not make any difference. In any case, I start from the original meaning, and I think there is room for dispute as to to what extent some of those elements of meaning are evolvable, such as the cruel and unusual punishment clause. The starting point, in any case, is the text of the document and what it meant to the society that adopted it. I think it is part of my whole philosophy, which is essentially a democratic philosophy that even the Constitution is, at bottom, at bottom, a democratic document. It was adopted by the people's acceptance of it, by their voting for it, and its legitimacy depends upon democratic adoption at the time it was enacted. Now, some of its provisions may have envisioned varying application with varying circumstances. That is a subject of some dispute and a point on which I am quite wishywashy. But I am clear on the fact that the original meaning is the starting point and the beginning of wisdom. 

On those types of issues, Senator, where the law has to be applied to circumstances that just did not exist at the time, you obviously have to decide as a judge what resolution would most comport with the application of that clause to the circumstances that did exist at the time and try to make it fit. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. May I thank the committee for its courtesy, and I have genuinely enjoyed being here.

Thank you, Senator.
