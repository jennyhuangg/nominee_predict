It is correct, I believe, Mr. Chairman. 

Yes, I did have at the time while I was practicing. 

AS I recall, the minimum period in which you could get an A.V. rating at the time was a period of practice of 10 years. And it seems to me I got it in 1966, though I cannot be absolutely positive as to the date. It was very shortly after the expiration of the minimum period. 

Yes, I believe it is. 

That certainly—it was either 11 or 12 years, Mr. Chairman. I am not positive as to the exact date. 

That is my understanding. 

I would not, Senator McClellan. 

I do not believe I would, Senator. I think that 

NO; I would not. 

I would not overrule a prior decision on the grounds that you suggest. 

I feel that great weight should be given to precedent. I think the Supreme Court has said many times that it is perhaps entitled to perhaps somewhat less weight in the field of constitutional law than it is in other areas of the law. But, nonetheless, I believe great weight should be given to it. I think that the fact that the Court was unanimous in handing down a precedent makes a precedent stronger than if a court was 5 to 4 in handing down the precedent. And I think the fact that a precedent has stood for a very long time, or has been reexamined by a succeeding number of judges, gives it added weight. 

None. 

NO; I do not believe I would. 

I not only can conceive it to be true, Senator McClellan, but I can recall at least one instance in which Justice Jackson, to whom I clerked, found as a Supreme Court Justice that he was obliged to disagree with something he had done as Attorney General. And I believe the same thing happened to Justice Clark.

Yes.

I certainly would not. 

NO; I would not. 

I think I would want to know more of the factual situation, Senator, and an examination of the data that I simply have not been exposed to before. I could not categorically agree that there is more danger that criminals would be allowed to escape than that they would be subject to tyranny. 

NO.

Yes, I do. I do not know what particular case that was quoted from, but I certainly

I subscribe unequivocally to the statement read. 

I certainly agree that the Court should leave to the Congress the rewriting of statutes.

Under my oath I believe it would have neither the power nor the duty.

I will "do my best not to disappoint you, Senator, should I be confirmed. 

Yes, Senator. 

YOU mean a judge changing his opinion as to what the Constitution or a statute means? 

I do not think there is any lack of fidelity to the Constitution if a judge, after mature consideration, decides that an earlier expression of opinion on his part as to the meaning of a particular clause was in error. 

He certainly does have the same obligation, in my opinion, Senator. I would add only the qualification that he must take into consideration the reasoning and the strength of the earlier precedents which really is a part of the Constitution.

I see no difference. 

It may be more difficult for a judge to change his mind from an earlier position taken as a judge, than it is for a judge to change his mind from an earlier position taken as an advocate, since the two roles are so clearly different. But I think the same principles would apply to both. 

Well, I remember a statement attributed to Justice Holmes at one time who said he was always suspicious of an advocate who came before the Supreme Court saying this was a court of justice, because he felt it was a court of law. I do not see any irreconcilable conflict in those two statements. I think if we say justice under law, that that is a very happy resolution. But the suggestion that the function of the judge is to deliver justice, in the sense of meting out what he personally conceives to be justice, quite apart from the Contitution or law, I would have to reject. 

Certainly my experience, in researching constitutional cases as a private lawyer, or as the Assistant Attorney General, has satisfied me that the due process clause of both the fifth and the 14th amendments is an extremely broad one and difficult to pin down, as an expression of constitutional law. And there is also no doubt in my mind that each of us, the Justices who have been confirmed in the past and I, if I were to be confirmed, would take to the Court what I am at the present time. There is no escaping it. I have lived for 47 years, and that goes with me. But I would hope that broad as the due process clause is, or broad as any other clause of the Constitution might be, I will try to divorce my personal views as to what I thought it ought to mean from what I conceived the framers to have intended. 

Very true. 

I have given it some further thought, Senator, and I would say that I have no reservation at all about what I said from the point of view of the Senate.I think I did not fully appreciate the difficulty of the position that the nominee is in.[Laughter.] I say that not entirely facetiously, because the nominee is in an extraordinarily difficult position. He cannot answer a question which would try to engage him in predictions as to what he would do on a specific fact situation or a particular doctrine after it reaches the Court. And yet, any member of the committee is clearly entitled to probe as to what might be called, for lack of better words, the judicial philosophy of the nominee. I think that is the right and the prerogative of any Senator who feels that is an appropriate test, and it would be presumptuous of me, perhaps, to even say that. But, I have no disagreement at all with my earlier statement in the Harvard Law Record that it certainly is a legitimate concern of the Senate if it chooses to make it so, what the judicial philosophy of the nominee is. 

It is so difficult to do it in meaningful terms. 

AS you suggest, Senator, I cannot speak for the President on the subject. I can give you my own observations. I suppose it is conceivable that one might feel that the two weie consistent if he also felt from his own study of decided cases that the pendulum had been swung too far toward the accused not by virtue of a fair reading of the Constitution but by virtue of what was conceived to be some outside influences such as the personal philosophy of one or more of the Justices. 

I would certainly expect that I would have a personal philosophy. I mean, I have lived 47 years. 

Well, my personal philosophy I would hope to disassociate to the greatest possible extent from my role as a judge. 

Unequivocally. 

Without hesitation. 

I would react to it in this way, Senator, recalling as best I can my thoughts when I penned those words some—what was it?—13 or 14 years ago. I would say that I had no intention then, and certainly would not say now, that Justice Black, who authored the opinion, or the others who concurred with the opinion, wrote it because they were sympathetic with Communism. I think the language I used was meant to suggest that they sympathize with the plight of unpopular groups, such as Communists, and I certainly did not mean to suggest that this is an illegitimate sympathy, but I did not feel that sympathy any more than any other sympathy ought to be read into the Constitution. 

NO; I do not believe it would. 

I think I meant the latter. 

Yes; that was roughly the same time as the Schware and Konigsberg cases being handed down, which I did take the time to study, as a private practitioner, albeit without the benefit of briefs and arguments. And I felt that given my best lights on the subject at the time, that Justice Harlan's dissent was the better view of the Constitution. 

Yes.

Your recollection is probably clearer on it than mine is, Senator.

New Mexico. 

Did I answer your question, Senator? 

Well, not only, had I anticipated today, but were I to rewrite it, without any prospect of a confirmation hearing, I do not think I would have used the term "political philosophy." But I think that my same observations would obtain. 

Well, I certainly perceive limits in the first amendment, in the fourth amendment, and without reading a catalogue, I suspect there are other limits.

Well, given the latter qualification, I would think it was improper and a misuse of executive authority. I testified before Senator Ervin's subcommittee that surveillance of a Member of Congress, and we were discussing surveillance in a public area, so to speak, of public meetings, public street, that sort of thing, was not per se unconstitutional.I also added that the only legitimate use of surveillance was either in the effort to apprehend or solve a crime, or prevent the commission of a crime, and I think I said at that time that surveillance has no proper role whatsoever in the area of where it is simply dissent rather than an effort to apprehend a criminal.

The harassment element was something I had not really considered in my testimony before Senator Ervin, and while I think it would be inappropriate for me to express a particular view of the particular facts, I would say that certainly it was not my intent to rule out careful consideration of that aspect of the thing. 

It certainly is the purpose to put restraints on the Government. 

Well, it might have something to do with the prudence or the wisdom of the decision, but it certainly has nothing to do with the soundness.

All I meant to say was I do not feel prudence or wisdom are necessarily the first test of a constitutional decision. If that is what the Constitution calls for, the fact that the police are handcuffed as a result is no argument against it.

Well, I certainly understand your interest, Senator. The expression of a view of a nominee on the constitutionality of a measure pending in Congress, I feel the nominee simply cannot answer. If it is a question of public statements I have made, as the rational basis for them as a lawyer, I would be happy to try to go into it.

Well, insofar as the antiwar amendments would attempt to limit the President's authority to preserve the lives or safety of men already lawfully in the field, I had reservations about the constitutionality, which I expressed.

AS I recall there were a number of amendments pending in the Congress, quite varying in their approach, and my recollection is not sufficiently good to recall the text of any of them. But I am sure I felt with at least the most restrictive that there was a constitutional problem.

Certainly. 

Let me answer it this way: To me, the question of Congress' authority to cut off funds under the appropriation power of the first amendment is so clear that I have no hesitancy in saying so, because I do not regard that as a debatable constitutional question. I think if one were again to get to the more restrictive types of amendments that were pending last year, there is some area of debatability, and it would be improper for me to answer that. 

Well, I am on record in a discussion before, again, one of the meetings of Senator Ervin's subcommittee as saying, andI think it is in these words, that I do not believe Congress has the authority, given the situation that existed in 1970, to tell the President that he shall not try another attack on Hamburger Hill. I believe that to be a well-reasoned advocate's statement of position, and I do not recall the full

Well, I 

Yes. I think I recognize it. 

It was a misguided and unwarranted use of force. 

This again, this type of question again poses a difficult problem for me, Senator, because there is clearly a lawyerclient relationship here. And if you are inquiring about any advice I have given to a private client, it would be unthinkable for me to testify to it.Nonetheless, my role has been one in reform of public office, and I am bound to say that I think you are entitled to get something more out of me than simply saying on every occasion that there is a lawyerclient relationship. This one is easy for me because he never asked me.

I believe that was where we left this morning, Senator. 

YOU mean urging the Attorney General to call a grand jury? 

NO; I did not.

Well, again, judging from the newspaper accounts I do not see how anyone could help but be distressed by what happened there. And the primary source of distress is the death of the students. I think one cannot help but be distressed over the position the National Guardsmen were put in. That does not justify what they did. But, so far as my own official responsibilities are concerned, our office is primarily a responder rather than an initiator. We are not an operatingdivision and the primary initiative in this area would be the Civil Rights Division.

And I do not believe I have ever thought it proper to simply jump into somebody else's bailiwick and say: Let us do this. 

Well, my impression is that this was undertaken at the behest of the Defense and the State Departments. 

Well, I would not be at all surprised if they had been given hearings in the Civil Rights Division, just as the Defense and State Departments were given hearings presumably in the Internal Security Division in connection with the Pentagon papers. 

NO; I did not.

SO far as the criminal aspect of the Pentagon papers situation as compared to the criminal aspects of the Kent State grand jury prosecutions I am simply not familiar enough with either of those to comment personnally. You are not asking me for my personal comments. I take it you are asking me what is a younger person going to think seeing it?

Just to read newspaper accounts without any full understanding of what may have been very different differentiations between the two situations, I think very likely many young people may have felt that one is not being treated the same as the other. That would not be my own personal opinion, but you are asking mewhat I think a young person might think simply on the basis of media accounts.

But, I am a lawyer, Senator Kennedy, and as a lawyer I feel that I would not make or jump to a conclusion that the disparity in time meant a disparity in the quality of justice administered without having a rather thorough knowledge of the factual situation, which I simply do not have.

I can answer generally to the effect that I think Congress has very significant oversight authority in connection with the operation of the executive branch. Whether that authority would extend to this particular situation or not I am simply not prepared to say.

Yes; I can see a reason. 

Correspondence across my desk between you and the Attorney General, and again, I feel free here since it has gone out of the Department to comment on it to the extend of my input, and I think you are entitled to get that, that some 30 years ago when Justice Jackson was an attorney general he wrote an opinion refusing the request of Carl Vinson, who was then chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee. Chairman Vinson had requested that his committee be furnished with FBI reports, and Justice Jackson in his opinion made what I felt was an extremely sound argument for the proposition that investigative files in the executive branch ought not be furnished to the legislative branch, both because of possible unfairness to the prosecution and possible unfairness to the potential defendants. 

It is a branch of the doctrine of executive privilege. 

That is a question of fact, Senator. 

NO; I am certainly not, but I am suggesting that I think the executive branch is entitled to consider, in analyzing that type of request, its past experience as to congressional committees maintaining a pledge of executive session type of confidentiality. And I certainly do not suggest that I know anything about the facts in connection with your own particular committee that would lead me to think that it would not be kept confidential. 

Well, as I understand it, and I am simply recalling the correspondence, and I do not think there was any offer of executive sessions.

I think to the extent to which I can answer that question, with the sense that I am adviser to the Attorney General, I would sa3" that that would be an added factor to be weighed in the case.

I do not know that much about it, Senator. 

My impression is that some of it was made available in an unknown quantity. So far as my knowledge is concerned, it was made available to the prosecuting attorneys in the State of Ohio. 

YOU realize, of course, I am sure, the difficulty that that question poses for me because of my relationship with the Attorney General. It does seem to me that because the Government ultimately took a public legal position and argued the matter in the courts, that I would not be breaching the attorney-client relationship to answer your question.I am hesitant, but I believe that I am right in saying that I had a slipped disk operation in the latter part of May, and was either at home in bed or in the hospital until about the latter part of the second week in June. I am just tiying to recall from memorj^. Then I started coming back into the office half days, and found that I was overdoing the first couple of days, so I stayed out again, And I think it was either on a Monday or Tuesday I was back in, perhaps for the third time, on a half-day basis, and the Attorney General advised me that the Internal Security Division was going to file papers that afternoon in New York to seek a preliminary restraining order and asked me if I saw any problem with it. And it was a short-time deadline, and I rather hurriedly called such of the members of my staff together as I was able to get.When we reviewed it we came across Near v. Minnesota, and advised the Attorne}T General that basically it was a factual question so far as we could tell. If the type of documents that were about to be published came within the definitional language used by Chief JusticeHughes in Near v. Minnesota there was a reasonable possibility that the Government would succeed in the action.I believe I had one other conference with the Attorney General, and I think that was as to who should appear for the United States in the proceedings in New York and in the second circuit. I then went to the beach for a week during which time the arguments took place in the Courts of Appeal, and I think the Supreme Court case was argued while I was at the beach, too, and I had no further involvement in it than that.

I do not think it is proper for me to answer that question, Senator. That has just been before the Supreme Court. If you want me to tell you what I understand the law to be as of now, I am not at all sure you would be interested in my account of that, and I think my own opinion is something that is simply too close to the type of question I would be asked to describe if I were confirmed, so that I ought not to answer it.

I would be reluctant to get into much detail in that for the same reason. I certainly have not quarrel with the language in the per curiam opinion that the Supreme Court handed down in connection with the New York Times case that prior restraint comes before this Court with a heavy burden on it. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go further than that.

I believe it is very important. 

Well, I think it would be inconceivable for a democracy to function effectively without a free press, because I think that the democracy depends in an extraoridnarily large degree on an informed public opinion. The only chance that the "outs," or those who do not presently control the Government, have to prevail at the next election is to make their views known and the press is one of the principal, probably the principal media in the country through which that can be accomplished. 1 believe it is a fundamental underpinning of a democratic society. Senator Kennedy. What would be your view—would you permit, say, the suppression by injunction of a newspaper that advocated violence? What could you tell us?Mr. REHNQUIST. I think that is too close, Senator. I would decline to answer that.

Well, I am not the first nominee that you or your fellow Senators on the Judiciary Committee have had this problem with. And I can fully sense the problem you have, and surely you can sense the problem that the nominee has, too. Past nominees have generally confined themselves to fairly general expressions, which I am sure are less than satisfying to the Senators. But, in the same token, to start discoursing on one's view, if one has a view, of of what the law should be in particular cases, or what he thinks the Constitution should be in particular cases, would strike me as entirely unappropriate.

I simply do not feel I can answer, properly answer the question about the constitutional principles that would be applied to a newspaper that advocates violence. I think that is too close to the kind of question that might come before or one might be called upon to answer as a Justice of the Supreme Court. I would be glad to try to respond to some other question.

I would say one would be the extraordinarily and presumably very rare situation contemplated by the language in Near v. Minnesota where you had the prospect of a newspaper publishing troop movements or troopship sailings with an extraordinarily high degree of danger, not to Government policy, but to the lives of the men who are engaged in the service of the Government.

That is what bothers me about it. 

I am trying to think of cases that have 

Just to give me, you know, ideas of what arguments have been made. I think we presently have under submission somewhere in the Government a brief on behalf of the NewspaperPublisher's Association that they should be exempt from the price freeze because of freedom of the press.Now, I have not had an occasion to review the merits of that brief, and I doubt that I will in my official capacity, because it belongs to another department. I would think that a newspaper's claim on the grounds of freedom of the press to be exempted from very unevenhanded types or even-handed types of economic relations such as the antitrust laws, the copyright laws, and a price control law, the interest of the Government in applying economic legislation uniformly so long as it is not hostilely inclined to the press would be another interest one would have to consider against the claim of freedom of the press in a situation like that.

I have said I place an extraordinarly high value on it, and I do not blame you for feeling you want something more specific than just a rather, what you may well consider, pious declaration, and yet I find that when one tries to elaborate specifics they tend to be things no one would disagree with or else we get into an area where the matter is likely to come before the court in some form.

My initial reaction was that we had very little time to come to a decision.

If you let me go on, because I am going to do the best I can to answer your question.

What do you mean by "might anticipate what the final outcome was going to be"?

I never felt I knew enough about the facts, which 1 really knew nothing about, to make an assessment. I felt it would turn on the facts, and I did not know what the facts were.

This presents me with the same sort of problem, which I must resolve for myself, realizing that if I resolve it against answering anybody on the committee, or anybody in the Senate, is entitled to hold against me my refusal to answer.I did speak publicly on the May Day matter down in North Carolina 2 or 3 days after it and I, therefore, feel that I do owe an obligation to the committee to describe at least in a general nature my role, without necessarily, without revealing, and "revealing" probably is not the right word, describing the various internal deliberations that went on in the Department. And this is a difficult line to walk.I will try to walk it. My role, up until the time of the events that actually took place was being consulted as to the propriety of the useof the Federal troops in certain situations under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 331 through 334. And I drafted an opinion which the Attorney General gave to the Secretary of Defense, saying that it was legally permissible to use Federal troops in order to preserve the operation of the Federal Government under the situation where a fairly large number of people had announced their intention to shut it down.And that opinion was transmitted by the Attorney General to the Secretary of Defense. I participated in two or three meetings over the weekend, immediately prior to the demonstrations, at which a good number of peple were present. I do not really think I had any significant input or contribution to make at those meetings.During the time the events were actually happening, I was in and out of the Attorney General's office. I was at a large meeting in the Criminal Division at which a number of people from the Corporation Counsel's office, the U.S. Attorney's Office, our Criminal Division, our Internal Security Division, were present.I do not believe I remained long, and since my own knowledge of the local practice of arraignment and arrest and that sort of thing is not very large, I found I had very little to contribute. There may have been more, but that is all that occurs to me now.

One decision reached at a meeting that I was at over the weekend, was that the permit should be revoked for the campground down at Hains Point, I believe it was. I made no objection to that decision.

I believe you have misread mj statement, Senator. 

Yes.

I made a statement saying that the abandonment of the field arrest procedures and the consequent, or perhaps not necessarily consequent, delay in bringing the defendants before an arresting magistrate, or a committing magistrate, was, I thought, defensible because the requirements that a defendant be brought before a magistrate were that he be brought before the magistrate within a reasonable time, and that in my opinion a reasonable time in this situation should take into consideration the necessity of the arresting officer, having made the arrest, continuing to be in the field to prevent the occurrence of other violence.I went on to say in the statement in Boone that in a situation more serious than that which prevailed in Washington on May Day, the doctrine of qualified martial law had on occasion been invoked. I made, I thought, quite clear, not only that it had not been invoked in69-267—71 4Washington, but that it would be justified only in a more aggravated situation.

I certainly am suggesting that. 

Well, knowing the volume of arrests which were made, I simply would not be in a position to comment on whether any particular arrest was made with or without 

Well, I stand by the language I used in North Carolina, and I would call it something less than a general endorsement of everything that was done on May Day. 

Well, I would have to know more about the facts to be satisfied that a particular thing done was not right. I did specifically say that I thought the abandonment of the field arrest forms by Chief Wilson was a legitimate and proper decision under the circumstances which he had to, I understand, confront. 

I do not think arresting without probable cause is ever proper, and if, in fact, it happened on May Day, I do not agree with it. I do not know enough about the facts to say that there were or were not arrests without probable cause on May Day. 

That is my understanding. 

It suggests to me that whereas there may have been probably cause for the arrest of the great number of people, the District of Columbia police were faced with such an overwhelming situation of violation of the law that they chose to try to keep the streets free, and rather than to preserve the necessary information that would enable them to later show either that there had been probable cause for an arrest, or probable cause to bind a man over. 

I am not satisfied that they did arrest a lot of people who were innocent.

Could I have the question repeated? Could I have either the reporter read the question back or 

1 think one thing that happened was that the number of people who were to be involved in May Day was an overwhelmingly large number, larger than the Metropolitan Police contemplated. As a result, they were faced with a choice of either, when an individual policeman arrested a law violator, or someone he thought was a law violator, of himself taking that man to the stationhouse, booking him, and going through the usual procedures, or simply having the man taken in some other manner to the stationhouse. And the policemen then would stay on the streets to try to arrest the next bunch who were coming along. And as I understand it, they were very deliberately tr3Ting to obstruct the movement of traffic, frequently by hazardous means. I think the District police opted in favor of the latter choice, and I cannot find it in myself to fault them for it. 

NO; I would not interpret my final answer that way.

I think what I said was that the Chief of the Metropolitan Police made a decision to abandon field arrest forms and run some risk of being unable to follow up on the prosecution of arrestees in the interest of keeping his forces on the street in order to preserve order, and that I could not faults him for that decision. Senatoi KENNEDY. IS there any procedure that was used during the course of that day, related to regulations, rules, or procedures which were established within the Justice Department, that you would have disagreed with? Mr. REHNQUIST. Well, the abandonment of field arrest forms, as I understand it, there was no decision taken within the Department. 

I was involved in some of the decisions, Senator. I suspect there were a great many that I was not involved in. It is, of course, relatively easy to look back in hindsight and say that one would have done something differently. And the one thing that occurs to me, and this is strictly a matter of hindsight, and I do not believe this was something that could have been fairty anticipated, was to supply more adequate facilities for those who were detained. 

Well, you have made the statement that there were arrests made without probable cause simply as bystanders and people who were walking to work. If that was the case I would certainly have done that differently. 

NO; I did not.

Well, certainly after newspaper accounts occurred one could not rule out that possibility.

Well, it certainly struck me after reading the stories in the newspapers, that if those accounts were true, people have been improperly arrested.

By the time the newspaper accounts occurred, I think whatever had happened had happened and the Corporation Counsel and United State's Attorney's Office, as I understand it, were already engaged in a screening process. I did not do anything. 1 did not feel there was anything that would be appropriate for me to do.

My statement in North Carolina, Senator, as I recall it, and as I see it, glancing through it, dealt with the abandonment of field-arrest forms, and the concept of a reasonable time in which to take a person before a committing magistrate. It did not purport to sweepingly endorse everything that had been done during the May Day demonstrations.As to what I may have done on m}7 own, my own initiative, after becoming aware, I have already answered that I did nothing, and I did not think it was appropriate to do anything.

I do not concede it to be a general endorsement. 

I am sure that I made a comment, Senator, to someone at some time that if these newspaper stories were true, certainly they arrested some people they should not have.

I can remember my own reaction to the newspaper stories, thinking that there are always two sides to a case, and I would want to hear the other side before making a decision, but at the same time, feeling if this was true it was wrong.

I am not sufficiently close to the actual operations in the field to have the necessary information to make a judgment as to whether particular procedures should be changed.As to the overall impression of the thing, the fact that there was not a serious injury, no loss of life, and that the Federal Capital was kept open, I think was a rather significant accomplishment.Now, if it could have been done without arresting anyone who should not have been arrested, if that did, indeed, happen, then it would be better to do it that way. Whether there is some system that could be devised with some several thousand individual policemen to insure that no one would ever be arrested without probable cause, I simply do not know.

Well, yes, that there must be probable cause to arrest.

Yes.

I face the same decision here. 

NO; it is attorney-client relationship. 

My client, in my position as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, is the Attorney General, and the President, and applying—-— 

Well, that puts the rest of the Consitution in the position of having someone advising them as to what his interpre-tation of the Constitution is. Presumably, each of them, being very busy men, they need to get that advice from somewhere, and they get it from me and they get it from other sources, also. But, the traditional role of the attorney-client privilege is that the attorney does not disclose advice given to his client and not otherwise made public.In the wiretapping situation, the Government has filed a brief in the Supreme Court of the United States, which is a matter of public record, and I would be happy to comment on my rather limited role in the preparation of that brief.

It was drafted in the Internal Security Division, and at the request of the Attorney General we were asked to work with the Internal Security Division in preparing the draft and revising it. We did that. It was then submitted to the Solicitor General in the usual course of events, and was finally filed after having been revised by him in the Supreme Court of the United States. 

I think that disqualification is a judicial act, Senator, just as one's vote to affirm or reverse a particular decision would be a judicial act and, therefore, I think it would be improper for me to express any opinion as to how I would act in a particular case. I think I mentioned to you when I was in your office the other day, and I now state publicly, that the memorandum prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel for Justice White, at the time he went to the court, strikes me as being a sound legal analysis of the basis on which one should disqualify himself. At least the thrust of that brief is personal participation in litigation 

Well, I think advising as to particular litigation it does cover. 

'MJ recollection is that it does not. 

I think that is a good deal more difficult question, Senator, and I think that I would have to say that I would do the best with the materials and precedents available to me. 

The factors will be the applicable disqualifications statutes which I recall are 28 U.S.C. 455, the factors set forth in that statute, and to the extent that the canons of judicial ethics would not be inconsistent with statute, the canons of judicial ethics. 

I obviously ought not to say that I will disqualify myself in the wiretapping case. I can say that in my opinion I person-ally participated in an advisory capacit}' in the preparation of that brief, and I will attempt to apply the standards, as I understand them, to that decision.

Senator, you are asking me as to a particular decision that I will make after I get on the court. I have said enough on that, I think, and you can draw }Tour own conclusions.

I am sure I have. 

Yes.

YOU mean how I got the numbers of—— 

Well, given the numbers, which I do not recall, but it seems to me it was something in the neighborhood of between 100 and 200, and the fact that there are 200 million citizens in the country, and presumably millions and millions of phones, I felt justified in saying that any number between 100 and 200 could not possibly be said to be pervasive. 

That is my understanding under the Omnibus Crime and Safe Streets Act of 1968. 

Yes; as set forth in the statute. 

Well, I can tell you nothing from personal knowledge. 

I am not sure whether I did or not. As I recall the latter number is somewhere between 30 and 40, so that whether or not I included it it would not change nry conclusion as to pervasiveness. 

That means that at a particular time there were 30 to 40, and I simply do not recall the figure, and I am trying to get it out of my memory generally, of this type of wiretap used. 

My understanding is not sufficiently great factually to be able to answer that.

I think it would be inappropriate for me to do so, Senator. I have acted as a spokesman and advocate in preparing a brief for the Government, and I think it would be inappropriate for me to express a personal view.

AS to when a wiretap ought to be used? 

In cases contained in the reservation of the act of 1968, as defined in the statutory language. 

I simply do not know. I do not have any part in the operational end of it. 

I think, having acted as an advocate and spokesman for the Department it would be inappropriate for me to give a personal view. 

Well, I can make a general comment. 

Well, I think my comment must be sufficiently general that it is not going to satisfy you. It is, having indicated in my London speech, it is not an appealing t}-pe of thing, and it is justified only by exigent circumstances. 

I was acting as a spokesman for the Department in London, and I have acted as a spokesman for the Department in other instances and in the preparation of the brief, and for that reason I do not think I should give my personal views. 

I do not think that one who has been an advocate, in a particular matter, particularly when it is under submission to the courts, is at all entitled to express a personal view. 

Everybody from the Justice Department does, I think. And you know, they do not want some either/or type of presentation. They want a justification of the Department position, and that is what I attempted to give them. 

Well, I will say this much, Senator, that certainly if I had felt from an advocate's point of view that the Department's position was indefensible, or personally obnoxious to me, I would have resigned. 

I did.

YOU are characterizing my letter, Senator. 

I do not have it in front of me. I am sure the text is available to everybody. 

I will try and answer any question about it. I do have some resistance about accepting a characterizing

TO the extent I recall the letter—I certainly recall the substance of it—it was basically an argument that those who attacked Judge Carswell's civil rights record were at least in part in error and that in addition, although the attack on his civil rights record might demand a good deal of popular support, the idea that it was solely a question of civil rights, and not also a question of other constitutional doctrines being involved, was a matter that should be more fairly presented.

I think the letter has to speak for itself, Senator. I certainly wrote it as an advocate. I think it is a very defensible piece of advocacy.

The letter is there; it is a matter of record. I wrote it. I think anyone is entitled to draw what fair inferences he feels can be made from it.

It is a matter of reasoned individual judgment. 

I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what the President's thought processes were, if I knew them.

Well, if by judicial conservative is meant one who will attempt to •

I simply cannot speak for him, Senator. 

Well, let me tell what I think 1 am, and then you decide whether I am a judicial conservative or not. My notion would be that one attempts to ascertain a constitutional meaning much as suggested by Senator McClellan's questions earlier, by the use of the language used by the framers, the historical materials available, and the precedents which other Justices of the Supreme Court have decided in cases involving a particular provision. 

Could you be any more specific? 

I think the comment I made, if you are referring to my University of Arizona speech, was in the Justice Department, like any other litigant, they had a perfect right to request the Court to review, and if it found it appropriate, overrule a precedent. 

Let me try.

TO the extent that I believe it proper, and it is a very unenviable task for a nominee, I am sure you realize, to the extent that a decision is not only unanimous at the time it is handed down, but has been repeatedly reaffirmed by a changing group of judges, such as Brown v. Board of Education, it seems to me there is no question but what that is the law of the land, that the one wa}r you try to arrive at the meaning of the Constitution is to try to see what the nine other Justices who took the oath of office thought it meant at the time they were faced with the question. On the other hand, to the extent that a precedent is not that authoritative in the sense of having stood for a shorter period of time, or having been handed down by a sharply divided court, then it is of less weight as a precedent.That is not to say that there is not a presumption in favor of precedent In every instance.I do not feel I can say moie without commenting on matters that actually might come before the Court.

I feel I have got to restrain myself. I have gone' as far as it seems to me a nominee ought to in indicating the way I conceive precedent to be applicable. I think anything——

Well, I think it is very important. 

Well, no; phrased the way you do, it certainly does not. 

Well, the idea that people's vote should be counted equally strikes me as something that virtually everyone in the room should agree to. But if you are putting it in a context of a particular fact question that might come before the Supreme Court—-—

I have done my best to indicate the use of precedent, and I simply fear that if one gets into particular issues, he is taking the position that is very inappropriate for a nominee. 

Yes, it is, Senator.

NO; I went on to Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, for one quarter, at which time I turned 18, and then I entered the Army Air Force.

Yes.

Yes; I graduate in 1948. 

Yes.

That is correct. 

Yes; it is.

It might be somewhat difficult to compile. I am sure it could be done.

It was a partnership, not a corporation, and I began representing it, I believe, in about 1960 or 1961.

They had a feed-lot operation and a cattle feeding operation. They had been growing cotton, but, as I recall, were getting out of it by the time I came to represent them, and they had purchased a fair amount of land along the Colorado River, which was my principal association with them, the litigation arising out of that purchase.

Lease, the acquisition of land; then, the lawsuit to determine title to the land, though I am sure I may have represented them on occasional land acquisitions.

Yes; I believe it is, Senator. When I first began representing them it was a locally owned company but still,, between that time and the time I left Phoenix, it was acquired by Transamerica.Seiiatoi BAYH. What was the name of the locally owned company? Mr. REHNQUIST. Phoenix Title & Trust. 

Well, my lepresentation of them was in litigation which they got into as the result of acting as escrow agent or trustee under a subdivision trust. Their business, as such, was to act as escrow agent am1 trustee in very large volume land transactions that occurred in the State of Arizona. 

Defendant and litigation. You know, 1 can give you a description of perhaps the last piece of litigation I represented them on.

1 believe I began representing them in 1963. Perhaps, it was 1962, and my principal representation was of the highway department, as a condeniner of lands necessary for the construction of highways. L was retained by them in at least one instance to defend them against the charge of improper maintenance and construction of a highway where a personal injury and death bad resulted from a collision on the highway, State highway.

I believe I am, yes. 

TO the best of my knowledge, yes. It is general and it is approximate, but I think it presents an unfortunately fair position of my financial position. 

Yes.

Those are 1969 letters? 

DO 3"OU want my present opinion? 

Well, I am inclined to agree with the comment that Judge Blackmun made during his confirmation hearings to the effect that judges generally, after the Senate's denial of confirmation to Judge Haynsworth, had become more sensitive and perhaps more astute to disqualify themselves than they had previously. So that my own inclination would be, applying the standards laid down by 28 U.S.C. 455, and to the extent there is no conflict between them and the canons of judicial ethics, to try to follow that sort of stricter standards that 1 think the Senate, by its vote, indicated should prevail. 

That is a difficult question for me, Senator, because certainly a literal reading of 28 U.S.C. 455 does not, as I recall the statute, seem to require that. 

A substantial interest in the case, not in the party. Yet there is no question that the arguments were made in the minority report of the Senate committee, and on the floor, that were persuasive to many Senators that the canons of the ABA and the strict interpretation of those canons which says that a judge disqualifies himself if he owns stock in a case should be followed. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to simply say right now that I would or would not disqualify myself if I had a share of stock, since I think that is a judicial decision. I think that I can fairly sa,j that I am sensitive, as Judge Blackmun indicated he was, to the closer and perhaps stricter view of disqualification that has prevailed since the Haynsworth decision. 

YOU think I should answer a question as to whether I would disqualify myself, if confirmed, if I owned a share of stock in a corporation?

But I think it would be singularly inappropriate, Senator, just because of that factor, for me now to try and announce to you how I will rule on that case. I have said I think there is an increased sensitivity, increased strictness, in the views of the disqualification statutes, and I think it would be inappropriate for me to say flatly what rule of law I would propose to apply if I were confirmed. 

Yes. I have no hesitancy in doing that. Since you are basically examining my professional qualifications as an advocate, we did not give to the committee that case because we did not find it. 

NO; we did not. We ran it down under the key note system, under "Disqualification," as I recall. Partly it was staff; partly, I remember going through these volumes, myself, and as I recall, the Commonwealth Coating simply did not show up. Now, obviously, one can be faulted for less than complete coverage in the cases on that point. I admit that, had I found the Commonwealth Coating at the time I wrote the letter, I certainly would have felt obligated to comment on it. I would not have felt that it changed the result which I reached in the letter.

Well, as suggested, Senator Bayh, Mr. Frank, in his testimony before the committee, I think he also was of the view that that case was not controlling. It was basically dealing with an arbitration case and a somewhat different factual situation. 

Yes, I do.

It is difficult to answer that question, Senator. I have participated in the political process in Arizona. I have represented indigent defendants in the Federal and State courts in Arizona. I have been a member of the County Legal Aid Society Board at a time when it was very difficult to get this sort of funding that they are getting today. I have represented indigents in civil rights actions. 1 realize that that is not, perhaps, a very impressive list. It is all that comes to mind now.

Well, can you give me some example of what you have in mind?

TO protect individuals and their homes against unreasonable searches and seizures.

That might be another way of putting it. 

[ think the Supreme Court has held that the fourth amendment applies to State and local governments as well as to the Federal Government. 

Yes; T believe it is. Do you want me to answer? 

Yes.

I have no idea whether it was a correct quotation. I can certainly remember in substance defending the administration's position on national security wiretapping, which has since been embodied in a brief in the Supreme Court of the United States.I cannot, at this time, recall the words I used. 

AS I said to Senator Kennedy, Senator Bayh, I think it inappropriate in a case in which I have appeared as an advocate to now give personal views. 

The format of the college visits which I participated in, 10 or 12 last year, was very simple: "Come and defend the Justice Department to the college students." They certainly would regard it as a lawyer-client relationship. 

Well, I doubt that you can find any statement, Senator, in which I have suggested that the Government should be given carte blanche authority to bug or wiretap. I recently made a statement at a forum in the New School for Social Research up in New York, attended by Mr. Mear of the Civil Liberties Union and Mr. Katzenbach, that I thought the Government had every reason to be satisfied with the limitations in the Omnibus Crime Act of 1968.

Well, it was dealt with to the extent that Congress made it clear that the limitations being imposed by that act were not to be carried over into that type of case.

I think that is a fairly debatable legal question. 

I think, again, having participated in the preparation of the Government's brief—the Government's brief which is on file in the Supreme Court of the United States—I think it wTould be inappropriate for me to give a personal opinion. 

I can tell you the position which the Government has taken and which I believe is a reasonably well done job of advocacy, and that is that given the facts, five preceding administrations have all taken the position that national security type of surveillance is permissible, that one Justice of the Supreme Court has expressed the view that the power does exist, two have expressedthe view that it does not exist, one has expressed the view that itdoes not exist, one has expressed the view that it is an open question, that Government is entirely justified in presenting the matter to the Court for its determination.

T think it would be inappropriate. 

I think the Department has taken the position that this is a distinction that is virtually impossible to make. Their position is taken on the basis of operational divisions with the knowledge of which I am not familiar, but I do not think it would be appropriate for me to make a personal observation. 

With the qualification that the surveillance ought to be in the interest of either apprehending criminals or preventing the commission of crime, and with the additional qualification that the surveillance talked about there is not wiretapping and it is not forcibly extracting information. It is simply the viewing in a public place. 

I feel is—what? 

My statement was, I believe, that I did not feel it was a violation of the first amendment. The question of whether it is warranted or not is a good deal different one it seems to me. The question of proper use of executive manpower, you know, with the idea of compiling dossiers on political figures, such as was being done by the Army at one time, strikes me as nonsense. 

I expressed that view at the time of the hearing before the Ervin committee. I was speaking for the Department, and I will stand by that statement. 

Well, I do not disagree with you at all, but it would seem to have no meaningful purpose to me.Even in my examination of the cases as a Justice Department lawyer, I was unwilling, and I did not feel that the precedents suggested that everything that was undesirable or meaningless was unconstitutional.

Can I answer that? I mean, Congress has it within its power any time it chooses to regulate the use of investigatory personnel on the part of the executive branch. It has the power as it did in the Omnibus Crime Act of 1968 of saying that Federal personnelsh all wiretap only under certain rather strictly defined standards. That is certainly one very available way of protecting. 

Speaking as a Justice Department advocate, as I was at the time, I think that a couple of earlier sentences immediately preceding the one you read, Senator, summarized the view that legislation tailored to meet specific evils would not receive the categorical opposition of the Department. I think, from the law enforcement point of view, we were skeptical of the notion that some sort of judicial hearing should be required before an investigation be even undertaken which, I think, would have the most deleterious effect on effective law enforcement, in effect, preventing the commencement of an investigation which might ultimately end up in a showing of probable cause before the investigation could even start. 

I think the LEAA bill sent up, in response to Senator Mathias' amendment to the LEAA Act of 1970, presents what struck me at the time I had a chance to look at it as a reasonable accommodation of the interests. 

In that it prevents the wholesale dissemination of criminal history information; it prevents almost completely thedissemination of criminal investigative information. It confers, in some cases, a right of private action for someone who is wronged by that. I do not pretend to carry in my mind even all of the significant provisions of the act, but it seems to me those were some of them.

I think it can go a long way, yes. 

I agree with that statement. My remarks before Senator Ervin's committee were in a context of the existence of the Bill of Rights, the existence of the statutory restrictions such as were contained in the 1968 act. And the question, as I understand it, was what additional statutory prescriptions should be placed on investigative processes.

Well, you are talking about a court warrant before you commence an investigation?

Well, you are required to get one now.

Well, as to whether Congress ought to enact legislation like this, I would not express any opinion. Our position in the brief in the Supreme Court has been that with the existing provisions in the act of 1968, the Constitution does not require that it be done.

YOU mean what would be wrong with passing such a statute?

I honestly do not understand your question, Senator.

I still do not understand. 

I think probably not.;

Yes.I think the ordinance really worked very well in Phoenix. It was readily accepted, and I think I have come to realize since it, more than 1 did at the time, the strong concern that minorities have for the recognition of these rights. I would not feel the same way today about it as I did then.

I think probably not. And if I may explain: My children here go to school out in Fairfax Count}', in schools that are integrated and attended by a minority of blacks. My son plays on a football team, on which both blacks and whites play. He plays on a basketball team on which blacks and whites play, and I feel he is better off for that experience than if he were playing on a team entirely composed of whites. This, however, is done in the context of the neighborhood school. All of these people are in the general geographical area and attend the school because of that. I would still have the same reservations I expressed in 1967 to the accomplishment of this same result by transporting people long distances, from the places where the}' live, in order to achieve this sort of racial balance, and what I would regard as rather an artificial way.

Well, I think that transporting long distances is undersirable for whatever purpose.

Well, in the context of the situation where there has not been de jure segregation, obviously we get into a situation where there are questions pending before the Court, and which it would be inappropriate for me to comment on. T do feel obligated to comment, because I did write the letter to the editor. I think you are entitled to inquire into my personal views on that particular point.

In the context of busing to achieve integration in a situation where it is not a dual school system; I think it is. 

Well 

The courts have held where a situation has pertained in segregation we are required and obligated to redress that balance. That was not the situation to which I was addressing myself in that letter. 

I would not undertake to explain the grounds of the NAACP opposition. I will try to give a fair answer to the specific charges so far as 1968 is concerned. My recollection is 1 had absolutely nothing to do with any sort of poll watching. That is not a completely fair answer or a completely responsive answer, because in earlier years ] did, and they may well have confused 196S with earlier years.My responsibilities, as I recall them, were never those of a challenger, but as one of a group of lawyers working for the Republican Party in Maricoba County who attempted to supply legal advice to persons who were challengers, and I was chairman of Avhat was called the Lawyers Committee in a couple of elections, biennial elections, which I believe were in the early 1960's. And we had situations where our challengers were excluded from precincts where we felt, by law, they were entitled to get into, and 1 might say that our challenging efforts were directed not to black precincts as such but to any precinct where there was a heavy preponderance of Democratic voting, just as our counterparts in the Democratic Party devoted their efforts to precincts in which there was a heavy preponderance of Republican voting.And, as matters worked out, what we finally developed was kind of a system of aibitration whereby my counterpart, who was for a coupleof elections chairman of the Democratic lawyers, and I, the chairman of the Republican lawyers, tried to arbitrate disputes that arose, and frequently the both of us would go together to a polling place and try to decide on the basis of a very hurried view of the facts wTho was in the right and who was in the wrong. And I can remember an occasion in which I felt that a couple of our challengers were being vehement and overbearing in a manner that was neither pioper nor permitted by law and of telling them so. I can also remember situations in which the Democratic poll judges were refusing to allow our challengers to enter the polling place, and I can remember my counterpart insisting that they let them in.So, I do not feel I can fairly be accused in the manner that the NAACP has accused me on the basis of what those activities were.

It was not devoted to minority group areas as such; it was devoted again to areas in which heavy Democratic pluralities were voting together, with some reason to believe that tombstones were being voted at the same time. And this was one of the principal means used to try to find letters returned with the addressee unknown and then to challenge the person on the basis of residence if he appeared to vote.I might say that the Democrats made equal use of the same device. 

I simply cannot speak for them. I know of my own conduct in these matters, and that the letters were mailed out on the basis of mathematical calculations of Democratic votes in precincts together with aueas in which there was some reason to believe that there actually were tombstone or absentee voting, and I know from my trips to polling places, as a member of the Lawyers Committee, that some of the precincts certainly had a number of blacks, a number of chicanos, and many of them were totally white. 

I do not remember the question, Senator. 

Oh, I do, too; I remember the question. 

Well, I certainly did not mean to suggest then or now that the Court at that time was sympathetic to the claims of Communists, because they, themselves, sympathized with communism. I think what I meant to suggest was that was an ideological sympathy with unpopular groups which was not developed from the Constitution itself which may have partaken of the decision. 

Well, I think my answer to that would be "Yes." 

And in a sense I probably should not have answered the last question "Yes," because I think one has got to reserve his complete independence of decision if he is confirmed. I think you are entitled to know my present impressions, and my present impressions are that the memo submitted to Byron White is a good summary of disqualification law, and that it requires disqualification where there has been personal participation, even in an advisory capacity on the preparation of a brief, and that I have participated in the wiretapping brief in an advisory capacity. 

1 would not want to venture an interpretation of the term of counsel, except to suggest I think it could fairly be said to mean "of counsel," as the term is traditionally used in the legal profession, representing a part in court.

Well, just as I understand your problem, you understand mine, Senator. I believe I have tried to give to Senator Kennedy some basic outlines, and however much it may displease you I do not feel I can do more.As I said, a decision that was handed down unanimously and has been unanimously reconsidered by a succeeding group of judges, of which Brown v. Board of Education would be an example, is to my mind the established constitutional law of the land.To the extent that one takes other decisions which were by a closely divided Court more recently, I would regard these precedents as not being as strong, though nonetheless entitled to weight.So far as the power of the Congress to enact civil rights legislation, such as the Public Accommodations Act of 1964, under the commerce clause, on matters like that, I think they have been sufficiently set at rest by a constitutional decision that one need not hesitate to say that that is so.

That is correct, Senator. If you were present when I answered Senator Bayh, I would answer you much the same way, and I 

Well, that was the only one. I never testified against any State legislation. 

Right. 

Right. 

In that context, I think that is a fair interpretation. 

OK. If we broaden it out, I certainly am not prepared to say, as a matter of personal philosophy, that property rights are necessarily at the bottom of the scale. Justice Jackson, for whom I worked, commented shortly before his death that the framers had chosen to join together life, liberty, and property, and he did not feel they should be separated. I think property rights are actually a very important form of individual rights. On the other hand, I am by no means prepared to say that a property right must not on some occasion—and 1 am again speaking personally and not in any sense of the Constitution or statutory construction—but certainly when a legislative decision is made that a property right must give way to what may be called a human right or an individual right, that may frequently be the correct choice. 

I feel that it is improper for me to answer in that context, Senator. 

Yes. I am not.

Senator, my fundamental commitment, if I am confirmed, will be to the greatest extent possible to totally disregard my own personal belief as to whether property is invariably sub-ordinate to individual freedom or whether they must be balanced in some way. I realize that you certainly are not required to take at face value my statement to this effect and that anyone is perfectly free to attach such significance as they will to Senator Ervin's very perceptive comments that what 1 am today is part of what 1 was yesterday, and yet, framed in the constitutional context in which you fran1" it, I think it is improper for me to answer it.

1 was speaking, I think, as a spokesman for the Department in the area of the pretrial detention bill. And T think that the contest of my remarks was that based on a historical unah sis of the cases that personal freedom can be limited by arrest, by detention of a subject, following- a trial, or even to a momentary search under the doctrine of Terry v. Ohio, that these are decisions that have been made by the Supreme Court, and are parameters under which the Justice Department and the Government now operate.

I was giving my best lawyer's view, I would say. as the Assistant Attorney General, of the constitutionality.

NO.

NO; I woidd not. 

Well, I think it is clear from my speech up there that I would not apply that principle to the situation where a person seeks to test the constitutionality of the law. He runs the risk of it being held constitutional, and then he must pay the price exacted by the law. But if the law is held unconstitutional, obviously he is vindicated.

I will bend every effort to do so, Senator, and I would regard myself as a failure as a Justice if I were unable to do so. 

Well, I think the framers drafted a document, Senator Hruska, which was capable of forming a framework of government, not just in 1789, but in our own day. And there is no question in my mind that the principles they laid down then, as subsequently interpreted, must be applied to very changed conditions which occur now rather than then.But, I think even now it is to the Constitution and to its authentic interpretation that we must turn in solving constitutional problems, rather than to simply an outside desire to be "in step with the times."

NO, I do not; and I think specifically the Bill of Rights was designed to prevent exactly that soit of thing, to prevent a majority, perhaps an ephemeral majorit}', from restricting or unduly impinging on the rights of unpopular minorities.

Certainly. 

Yes; it is.

Well, I would certainly not want to comment on any particular matter that would come before the Supreme Court were 1 confirmed in that context. Taking Judge Lumbard's statement as a desirable philosophical approach to the problem of law enforcement, the concomitant development of the rights of individuals, and the efficacy of law enforcement, I certainly have no quarrel with it at all. Ultimately, of course, any such philosophical judgment or legislative judgment is subject to the requirements of the Constitution, and were I confirmed as a Justice of the Supreme Court, it would be the commands of the Constitution, as I understand them, that I would employ in passing judgment on any such measures. 

Well, if in fact the Bill of Rights does produce such an imbalance, we have a problem. But, it is obviously not one that the Justices of the Supreme Court should solve by rewriting the Bill of Rights so that it permits more balance on the side of law enforcement. It seems to me that the type of situation which you are referring to, and perhaps I am poorly paraphrasing your language, is that the preamble and other sections of the Constitution contemplate that the legislative process, shall ultimately govern, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. And that where the Constitution itself, were it to be distorted in meaning, so as to unreasonably restrict what was the intent of the Framers as to the extent of the legislative power, then it would be something that ought to be corrected. 

NO, I was sure it was not. 

Certainly all sections of the Constitution that have any applicability to a case should be considered.

The Philadelphia plan, Senator, was a proposal implemented under the leadership of the Department of Labor to require in the construction trades in Philadelphia, and in other localities where the situation was similar to that which had prevailed in Philadelphia, where in effect statistics and history indicated that minority members were simply not getting into unions, and the construction contractors were depending on union hiring halls to furnish their employees, to require, as a condition of receiving a Government contract, a commitment to achieve, if possible, certain goals of minority hiring. My role was that almost immediately after the plan was announced by the then Labor Secretary Shultz, the Comptroller General of the United States rendered an opinion that in his view the plan was unconstitutional and unauthorized by law. This obviously put the Secretary of Labor in a serious bind and he consulted the Attorney General and requested an Attorney General's opinion on the legality of the plan. With the help of the Solicitor's Office in the Labor Department, and our own Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department, we prepared a draft opinion, which was ultimately signed by the Attorney General, upholding the legality and constitutionality of that plan. 

I do not know that I know that much about it. 

My recollection is that it was the construction trade unions and some of the contractors. 

Well, naturally it would be improper for me to comment in any sense in a situation like that that might come before the Court for review, whether or not I might feel bound to disqualify myself. But certainly it sounds as if Attorney General Kennedy's testimony was very similar to the practice presently followed by the Department of Justice in which it is substantially defended in the brief just filed by the Government in the Supreme Court of the United States, the limitation to national security cases, and the importance of the same to the protection of the Government, itself, that is.

Yes, and we now have 9 additional years of precedent which we have cited in the Department's brief, since Attorney General Kennedy spoke in 1962.

Point Reyes Park in California? No. 

I do not know that it would be elaboration. Senator, but I will certainly do my best to give you my ideas on the subject from, as you might imagine, a very general point of view which I feel is all that I could say at this time.I think that in interpreting the Constitution, one goes first to the document itself, to the historical materials that may be available, casting light on what its framers may have intended, and to the decisions made by the Supreme Court construing it, and I think that precedent is very important in the case of all branches of the law.I think it is important in constitutional law although I think traditionally it is regarded as less binding in the area of constitutional law than it is, for example, in the area of statutory construction.I think it is nonetheless important and an important factor to be considered because basically it represents the judgment of what nine other Justices who took the oath of office to faithfully administer the Constitution thought it meant on the facts before them then. And I think any decision rendered in that matter is entitled to great weight by a subsequent Court in considering the same question.

Yes; I would. 

I would hark back, and it seems to me it was Justice Brandeis in the Ashwander case, although I may be mistaken both as to the Justice and as to the case, where the observation was made that in the case of statutory construction, stare decisis should be given virtually controlling weight because it is always within the power of Congress to change a decision should it feel that the Court has misinterpreted congressional intent, whereas in the area of constitutional law, with the great difficulty of constitutional amendment as opposed to mere revision or amendment of the law by Congress, there is a tendency to be more willing to review a prior piecedent on its merits.

Senator, I have made public statements as Assistant Attorney General in support of the constitutionality of pretrial detention and in support of the Department's position with respect to wiretapping in national security cases.69-267—71 10

I have done that, yes. 

I would say "No, Senator, I think that five administrations have taken that position from the time of Franklin Roosevelt until the time of President Nixon. We worked in an advisory capacity in our office on the Government's brief to be presented to the U.S. Supreme Court in defense of that authority. We worked with the Internal Security- Division people. But we were dealing with materials that had been evolved previously. 

That certainly was our reading of the exchanges of correspondence between the Attor:ie}*s General and the Presidents. 

That is correct, with this qualification, Senator: had I felt the positions I was taking or the doctrines I was espousing were utterty obnoxious to me personally, I simply would not have continued in that position, but I did regard myself as an advocate.

I spoke for it as an advocate. 

Senator, I was asked the same question yesterday by another Senator and I told him that 1 felt having been an advocate for the Department in the matter and being presently in the position of a nominee, it would be inappropriate for me to answer that question.If 1 might add this observation, having headed for a while last year the Justice Department's program of campus visitations and on one of which I had the pleasure of going to the University of Hawaii, 1 could not help but realize from talking to some of the student audiences that there was a very real fear in this area.You made the comment, ''whether based on fact or fancy." My impression from what 1 know about the facts and figures of the Federal Government's wiretapping activities is that it is not based on fact, but as you point out, whether it is based on fact or fancy, it can nevertheless have a chilling effect on one's feeling of freedom to communicate through the telephone and other such means.And my own hope would be that by a campaign of bringing the facts to the attention of the citizenry, of the actually extraordinarily limited use of these mechanisms by the Government, that some of the fear based not on what is actually done but on third and fourth hand accounts of what is done could be put to rest.I regret that I feel it inappropriate to answer your primary question. 

Senator, that very issue has been decided in two separate district courts and 1 woidd assume is probably on its way through the courts of appeal and ultimately to the Supreme Court. I just do not think it would be appropriate for me to answer. 

AS I suggested 3'esterday in response to a question, having personally participated in an advisory capacity in the preparation of the Government's brief in the national security wiretapping case, and applying the standards laid down in the memorandum prepared for Mr. Justice White when he went on the Court, I would thinkwithout obviously positively committing myself that I would probably be required to disqualify myself in that case.Insofar as simply having generally advocated before students, student audiences, or otherwise defended the Government's use of the authority given it by Congress, I believe that I could divorce mj- role as an advocate from what it would be as a Justice of the Supreme Court should I be confirmed.

There certainly is a difference between a search warrant for particular tangible evidence thought to be located in a particular physical location and a court order for a wiretap, albeit limited in time, for the reasons that you state, Senator.

I think it would be inappropriate for me to answer that question, Senator, in view of my role as advocate. I can certainly say that promiscuous wiretapping I would regard as a very dangerous practice.

With the reservations I previously stated, Senator, and with my lack of familiarity with the detailed provisions of the bill which you are describing, I think I must keep my answer general.Certainly any sort of electronic surveillance that would interfere with the lawyer-client relationship of a defendant after he has been charged would be very disturbing.

Senator, I have had, I think, one grand jury in my life and I am not intimately familiar with the practices or procedures governing grand juries. I would be hesitant to express a view simply from lack of knowledge on that point. My impression from the situation which you describe is that at least in some cases the witness would be adequately protected by the invocation of the fifth amendment. However, I can imagine it being used in a harassing manner also. 

Oh, I certainly do not think any witness should be tricked by the Government. If your question goes further than that, I would have to almost say I would want to see the particular facts. 

My first comment would be I can defend rrryself from my enemies but save me from my friends. [Laughter.]I think that that is not a fair characterization even of vaj philosophical views. M}^ hope would be if I were confirmed to divorce as much as possible whatever my own preferences, perhaps, as a legislator or as a private citizen would be as to how a particular question should be resolved and address myself simply to what I understand the Constitution and the laws enacted b}T Congress to require.

Yes, I do.

Recalling as best I can from Mr. Wiener's book, which I believe is the source of my knowledge on the subject, it is the situation where the force brought to bear against the law enforcement forces is such that the normal procedure of individual arrest and booking and admission to bail and appearance before a community magistrate simply cannot be carried out and in this situation it is my understanding that the courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Moyer v. Peabody, have said it was lawful for the Government in that situation to resort to a situation of arrest not on the basis of criminal charge of individual wrongdoing but on a very temporary basis of simply restoring order, and that the process was not arrest in the normal sense and that release was required in a very short order as soon as the serious emergency had passed.That is a short summary of my understanding of it, Senator. 

AS I said yesterday in response to another question, Senator Mathias, with respect to the public accommodations ordinance, I think my views have changed.With respect to the 1967 letter which I wrote in the context of the Phoenix school system as it then existed, I think I still am of the view that busing or transportation over long distances of students for the purpose of achieving a racial balance where you do not have a dual school system is not desirable.

I would hope none. I realize that that is the same question I would Avant to be asking a nominee if I were a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I cast about for some way of perhaps giving some objective evidence of the fact, rather than simply asking }Tou to rely on my assurance.I was on several occasions in Phoenix chosen to be an arbitrator between lawyers who found themselves in dispute with respect to particular claims, and I think the reason I was chosen was because there was a feeling that I would be fair, that whatever I might feel about personalities involved or about personal doctrine, I would try to apply whatever law there was to the facts and reach a fair conclusion.I have ahvays felt that, as I think Justice Frankfurter said, you inevitably take yourself and your background with you to the Court. There is no way you can avoid it, but J think it Avas Frankfurter who also said, if putting on the robe does not change a man, there is something AATong AATith the man. I subscribe unresenredly to that philosophy, that Avhen you put on the robe, 3-011 are not there to enforce your oAvn notions as to AArhat is desirable public policy. You are there to construe as objectively as 3rou possibhj can the Constitution of the United States, the statutes of Congress, and AA^hatever relevant legal materials there may be in the case before you.

It is so difficult to pin down the terms "liberal" and "conser\-ative," and I suspect they may mean something different Avhen one is talking about a political alinement as opposed to a judicial philosophy on the Supreme Court.I think it would be presumptuous of me to suggest to the Senators on this committee, or to the Senate as a Avhole, AA'hat standards they ought to look for, but I cannot think of a better one than fidelity to the Constitution and let the chips fall Avhere they may, so to speak, whether the particular decision pleases one group or pleases another.I think to an extent in discussion about the Court there has been a tendency to equate conservatism of judicial philosophy not with a conservative political bias, but with a tendency to want to assure one's self that the Constitution does indeed require a particular result before saying so, and to equate liberalism with a feeling that at least on the part of the person making the observation that the person tends to read his own views into the Constitution.I think the difference is well illustrated by Justice Frankfurter's career, who came on the Court at a time when I think it was clear to most observers that the old Court of the nine old men of the twenties and thirties was indeed, on any objective analysis, reading its own views into the Constitution, and Justice Frankfurter, of course, prior to his ascent to the bench, had been critical of this, and as a Justice he helped demolish the notion that there was some sort of freedom of contract written into the Constitution which protected businessmen from economic regulation.And yet, when other doctrines were tested later in the Court, it proved that he was not simply an exponent of the current politically liberal ideology and reading that into the Constitution.He was careful to try to read neither the doctrine of the preceding Court nor perhaps his own personal views at a later time to the Constitution, but to simply read it as he saw it.

Senator, I honestly think that is too specific a question for me to answer. I know there are several cases pending up there now and I would anticipate that there would be a number in the future.

I do not believe I ought to, Senator. 

I just think it would be inappropriate for me to try to now advance some sort of definition of a term which may well, if I were confirmed, come before me and on which I would hear argument and read briefs and have the benefit of discussion in the conference room.

NO. I do not think it really does distort it. I think what was meant was that the guarantees of the first amendment do not mean that everybody is going to be provided with a printing press in order that they can have their own newspapers, but instead that anyone who has a newspaper is going to be permitted to say whatever he thinks. 

Well, I would say that the series of freedom of contract cases, Lochner v. New York, Adkins v. Children's Hospital, by the objective judgment of historians, represented an intrusion of personal political philosophy into constitutional doctrine which the framers had never intended, and that Frankfurter had criticized that from the outside of the Court. It was not entirely clear until he hadbeen on the Bench whether the basis for his criticism was that he did not want laws like that held unconstitutional or whether it was that he felt there wTas no constitutional warrant for invalidating them, and I suppose you never know about an advocate until he does get on the Bench because it is only then that he is put to the test.But the test came for him, I suspect, not so much in those cases but in other cases which later came before the Court, where he had great personal reservations, I suspect, about what was being done but, nevertheless, felt that the Constitution did not prevent it.

Could you spell out the question a little more? 

Well, trying to keep it in the terms of historical analysis rather than my own estimate of how I would decide something, I think Justice Frankfurter's behavior while he was a member of the Warren court is some indication at least of his agreement with them in some areas and disagreement in others. He joined the unanimous decision in the school desegregation cases. He dissented from some of the cases involving the rights of criminal defendants. 

Well, it is much easier to make a historical judgment with at least a degree of confidence about decisions that were handed down over a period of years from 1905 to 1935 than it is with respect to a Court whose decisions are handed down from a period of 1953 until 2 years ago, if that is what you mean by the Warren Court, and therefore I think there is a great deal of difference in the confidence with which one can say history, in the sense of legal historians objectively evaluating it, has said that the so-called nine old men were wrong, at least a majority of them were wrong, in reading in freedom of contract. I do not claim to be a keen student of legal historians analyzing the Warren Court. I would think that in the area of the Warren Court's criminal law decisions there probably is not the same consensus as to legal historians at the present time. 

Well, wThat I am giving you is my understanding of a historical consensus, and

Yes, on the freedom of contract doctrine I think I would agree. I think the historical consensus, because of the recency of the Warren Court's decision, is less firm, partly for that reason. I think there is substantial historical consensus in accord with the Brown versus Board of Education decision. I think that in the criminal law area, it is my understanding that there simply is not that sort of consensus. Whether it is from lack of time to develop or from disagreement 

Well, I certainly would not set myself up to make some sort of sweeping generalization about the Warren Court which sat from 1953 to 1969. 

I was prepared to do it in the sense of a very specific doctrine that was enunciated over a period of years from about 1905 to 1935. 

Certainly the Warren Court was known for those types of cases; yes. 

I have given you my evaluation in terms of my understanding of a historical consensus. I wrote publicly on two cases decided by the Warren Court in 1957 or 1958. That was on the basis of making a reasonably careful study of the cases and the precedents and coming to a conclusion. I certainly would not attempt to categorize all streams of cases without having had some opportunity to research the precedents, even from a historical point of view. 

NO. I am not prepared to say that.

That is substantially correct, yes. 

NO I am still here. 

1 do not think that is an entirely fair statement. 

I know we have. I think it would be inappropriate in an area where I have acted as an advocate to express a personal view. I realize that leaves you in an unsatisfied position, but I do not feel I can do otherwise. 

I am simply not able to. 

I testified before the House Judiciary Committee. 

Yes.

I think I must refrain from answering. 

Well, I think that, if I may speak with extreme generality as I feel is required, that 

Certainly the equal protection of the laws clause in the 14th amendment protexts women just as it protects other discrete minorities, if one could call women a minority. 

NO. I think the Court has been quite unwilling—in tliat Michigan bartender case decided about 1940 or 1949, they held that a limitation on a right of women to tend bar, as I recall, which was a fairly stringent limitation, nonetheless was not a violation of the equal protection clause, and it seems to me that there is one other case which I do not recall in which they also held something claimed to be a violation of equal protection clause was not one.

I think that is one of the issues in one of the cases that is up there now.

Yes.

I think it is not appropriate for me to get any more specific. To say whether I agree with the doctrine of a particular case or not I think would be entirely inappropriate for a nominee. 

YOU mean as a matter—do I think it philosophically sound in accordance with my own personal notions? 

Well, I will certainly try to answer that, with the understanding that this is not the same thing as saying that the Constitution so provides. 

Yes.

That was the view I took in the testimony I presented to Senator Ervin's committee on behalf of the Justice Department. 

My personal view as to whether something that may be bad government policy is nonetheless not unconstitutional?

I think that calls for a judgment on the very specific factual situation.

I think that calls for a constitutional judgment on the very specific sets of facts and I do not think I ought to give it.

None at all, Senator Bayh. 

I think that there are some paragraphs in my Houston law day speech which recognize the great importance of recognition of minority rights, that the progress is not as fast as we would like and that more remains to be done. I am trying to think of some other public statement that may contain similar—well, you know, I am just going back through isolated passages in public statements.

Well, I am trying to think through, perhaps going backward from the public remarks I have made in the Justice Department. I think in my so-called New Barbarians speech I made the statement that the people who lie on railroad tracks to prevent the carrying out of the laws stand on exactly the same footing as a Southern Governor who stands in the schoolhouse door.Now, this may not indicate anything more than a statement on my part but it certainly indicated that I have, long before my nomination to the Supreme Court was made, felt strongly that the law of the land should be carried out in every part of the country and that resistance to it, whether in the name of interposition or something else in the South, or whether in the name of consciencious objection somewhere else, couldn't be tolerated.

Justice Miller, I think, made the statement in the slaughterhouse cases that in his opinion the principal import of the post-Civil War amendments was to benefit the Negro race.I have always felt that was contemporaneous construction and a sound one of those amendments.

I think I would justify it in this manner: that presumably the nine Justices sitting on the Court at the time that Brown versus Board of Education came before them canvassed, indeed they canvassed to such an extent that they set the case down for reargument on specific issues, deeply canvassed the historical intent of the 14th amendment's framers, the debates on the floors of Congress, and concluded that the Court in Plessy against Ferguson had not correctly interpreted that. Now, that seems to me a very proper role of the Court. Precedent is not sacrosanct in that sense. Due weight has to be given to the Justices of an earlier day who gave their conscientious interpretation, but if a recanvass of the historical intent of the framers indicates that that earlier Court was wrong, then the subsequent Court has no choice but to overrule the earlier decisions. 

Of course, I do not support lawmaking as a Supreme Court judge; but as I stated yesterday, if nine Justices, presumably of the same varying temperaments that one customarily gets on the Supreme Court at the same time, all address themselves to the issue and all unanimously decide that the Constitution requires a particular result, that, to me, is very strong evidence that the Constitution does, in fact, require that result. But that is not lawmaking. It is interpretation of the Constitution just as was contemplated by John Marshall in Marbury versus Madison. 

Count the number of votes where?

IS the thrust of your question the idea that I was suggesting that unless all nine of them agree, none of them should have voted to overrule Plessy versus Ferguson! m 

Well, I don't think you would ever say that a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court is irrelevant in determining a case before }Tou as a Justice of the Supreme Court. I think one would approach a unanimous decision, particularly one that has been reexamined and reaffirmed, with the greatest deference. That doesn't say you never decide otherwise.

Well, an examination into the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment. If you became convinced that the Plessy Court had not properly interpreted that intent, that it had simply adopted a view that was too narrow to be consistent with what the framers of the 14th amendment intended, then I think you would be entitled to disregard Plessy.Again, an 8-to-l decision is not one lightly to be disregarded, but nonetheless, if upon reexamination giving the weight that you ought to give to a precedent it appears wrong, then it is wrong.

Well, I suppose one is entitled to take into account the fact that public education in 1954 is a much more significant institution in our society than it was in 1896. That is not to say thatthat means that the framers of the 14th amendment may have meant one thing but now we change that, but just that the rather broad language they used now has a somewhat different application because of new development in our society.

I have felt obligated to respond with my personal views on busing because of the letter which I wrote and I have done so with a good deal of reluctance because of the fact that obviously busing has been and is still a question of constitutional dimension in view of some of the Supreme Court decisions, and I am loath to expand on what I have previously said.My personal opinion is that I remain of the same view as to busing over long distances. The idea of transporting people by bus in the interest of quality education is certainly something I would feel I would want to consider all the factors involved in. I think that is a legislative, or at least a local school board type of decision.

Well, there is no doubt of that. 

I am not sure that I know that much about the various schools in Phoenix at the time to answer that. 

Well, I will stand on my earlier statement that the busing over long distances to achieve racial balance which many might think also contributed to quality education was a burden that the schools in Phoenix as they existed at that time should not have to bear. 

Oh, certainly. 

Senator, I think that goes beyond the bounds of simply my present view as to the comments I made in 1957 and since it is so obviously something that could come before the Supreme Court, I don't think I ought to answer it.

I think I will stand on my earlier statement. 

I have to assume it is a hypothetical question, although some elements have certainly been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local courts here. I think some of them are assumptions. But speaking to it as a combined factual and nypothetical question, I did not make any effort to intervene in the matter after the turmoil for two reasons, I suspect: One is that the Office of Legal Counsel is basically an advisory branch of the Justice Department. The operational divisions—the criminal division, civil rights division, internal security division—are the people who handle things in the courts and in this case, as a matter of fact, I think it was the District of Columbia Corporation Counsel and the U.S. attorneys who were handling it. The second thing is that, as I recall, my last day in the office before I was down with this back trouble was sometime around May 8 or 9, and I was simply incapacitated from that time until early June. 

I think that it is a generally applicable principle in the lawyer-client relationship that the lawyer does not express his personal view as to the merits of the client's case. I think that that has added applicability here because the effect, assuming that there were some areas in which I disagreed with the position I have publicly taken for my clients would be disadvantageous to them. For that reason I certainly don't feel I can simply answer in areas where I may be in agreement and say "No comment" where I am in disagreement, since the obvious implication would be that where I say "No comment" I am in disagreement; and I think this is less than fateful advocacy on the part of a lawyer toward his client.Now, I realize that this puts the committee in something of a dilemma. I don't know that it is much different than that posed by the position of other nominees who have come here, but at any rate I am simply unwilling now, even though I may be a Supreme Court nominee, to foresake what I conceive to be my obligation to my clients.69-267—71 12

Both are certainly involved in many of the cases. 

My clients are the Attorney General and the President. 

Well 

NO. That, Senator, I regard as a great oversimplification. Certainly as to the President, if one conceives him to be a client and have a law3Ter which I don't think is the happiest expression of that relationship, he is, for all practical purposes, a popularly elected executive who is responsible to the Nation as a whole every 4 3Tears for an electoral mandate. The Attorney General is the President's appointee. He is responsible to the President. I am the President's appointee to a position where I am responsible both to the Attorney General and to the President. 

Certainly the President is the closest thing in a Republican form of government that may be typified as representing the people. 

Certainly, the client is entitled to waive the privilege. The lawyer is not.

Well, I think to the extent that the Department, the administration, takes a public position, 1 feel free to discuss and have discussed my own personal contribution to that position—the New York Times case being an example; the preparation of the national security wiretapping brief being another example. But insofar as I may have been asked for advice in the process of making administration policy decisions upon which the administration has not taken a public position, there, I think, the lawyer-client privilege very definitely obtains.Where the administration has taken a public position and the lawyer is asked not what advice did you give in connection with that position but basically do you personally agree with the position or not, there, 1 tlrink, it is inappropriate to answer even though a public position has been taken.

Yes; I do.

1 would think that it could be; yes. 

I would certainly think the privilege could be waived by the clients. Now, just who the client is, whether it is the President or the Attorney General, is something that would depend on the particular circumstances.

I agree on that. 

Without suggesting at all my own impressions as to what a response would be, I would certainly have no objection to your sending

I believe it is, Senator. 

It is not that I have any hesitancy in answering the question, except as to the propriety of repeating any discussion with the President. Since there was none here, I suppose I need have no hesitancy; no, he did not. 

Certainly those sources were available to him. 

NO; I don't believe they would. 

Certainly past nominations have generally taken that position, and I think their refusals to answer that sort of question were probably justified.

Senator, could I get up and walk around the table once? 

Put in context, Senator, I do. The last sentence that you quoted was, as I am sure is apparent to you, a prediction on my part of what I thought the Court would do. That does not represent my own personal opinion. But put in the context of surveillance, not in the sense of wiretapping or invasion of premises or in terms of trying to use Government sanctions to extract information from people, but simply the observation of someone in a public place and qualified by the possibility that the result would be different where actual harrassment were shown, as I commented yesterday, my answer to your question is yes. 

That was my testimony at that time. I think that I am entitled to have borne in mind the fact that I was then a Justice Department spokesman, and that the Justice Department as a possible litigant in such action, is certainly required to take a reasonable position, but it is not required to take the one which would be most restrictive on its activities. 

I didn't mean to say precisely that, Senator. I said that if I felt what I was saying was reprehensible or obnoxious to me, I would not be in the position I am in now. I would take that to leave open disagreements within what I consider to be reasonable bounds.

Would you read that back again? 

I am not sure I do agree with that now. I am inclined to think that it is a fact question and I was perhaps resolving the fact question in my own mind on the basis of the line of inquiry that Senator Hart made yesterday, where thousands of people came, knowing there was going to be such surveillance, on the basis of Judge Austin's decision in Chicago, where he found as a fact that there was no stifling effect.I do not think I would want to categorically say that such surveillance could not have a stifling effect. I think I would treat it as a question of fact.

The question being whether surveillance 

Again, assuming that in fact the surveillance efforts have no chilling effect, I would stand by that answer, I think, again as a spokesman for the Department. 

In the absence of a causative connection between some sort of chilling effect and the surveillance itself, that was the position I took for the Department, and I believe it would be a reasonable one. 

Well, I don't think the question was phrased that way.

Given the factual assumption of a chilling effect, then I would want to reserve judgment. 

Yes, sir; as in a Chicago type of case, I do. 

That is the type of fact situation I would want to know before attempting to answer yes or no on the existence of a chilling effect. 

Subject to the qualification I gave to my previous answer to your question, I would stand by that statement. 

NO ; I am not talking about the sense of redemption of the individual lawbreaker, although certainly I realize the word "atonement" can be used in that sense. I am thinking more of the idea which I also expressed in the same speech, that he who strikes at a law, strikes at the law, and that every time a law is violated there is a risk of a snowballing effect. Thus, individual sentences under the law, while all that are appropriate for the individual violator, may not be able to redress the necessary respect for law on the part of society as a whole. 

NO; not in the sense that he shouldn't be restored .to whatever civil rights and freedom the law authorizes in that situa-69-267—71 13tion. All I meant was that a deliberate lawbreaker strikes a blow at the system, as well as committing a personal violation of the law.

What I meant wTas that what has been occasionally characterized as nonviolent disobedience, lying down on railroad tacks in front of troop trains, and that sort of thing, to prevent the ordinary functions of government to be carried out, simply because it is not itself violent, is not therefore justifiable.

Justice Holmes made the remark in a case he decided when he was a judge of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, that a man may have a right to free speech, but he has no right to be a policeman. He in effect held that whatever locality it was in Massachusetts had a perfect right to dismiss a policeman for exercising free speech because it wasn't violating the freedom of speech provisions.I think the courts have since taken a broader view of the free speech provision and felt, quite properly, that the sanction of dismissal was itself an infringement on free speech, could be tolerated in some situations and not others, and I think the great view of history today is that Justice Holmes was mistaken in making that assertion.

Yes, sir; I do.

Yes, sir, Senator. Senator Mathias asked me a somewhat similar question this morning, and I think I said in reply to him that the first amendment did not require that the Government equip everybody with a printing press or give them each a television station. It meant simply that those who had printing presses and those who had television stations should be able to say whatever thev wanted to.

Not at all, and your statement is perhaps a better statement than I made on what the fact is, that the man with the television station has a better chance to express his views than the man who doesn't have it, but each has free speech within his own compass.

Well, putting aside any conceivable constitutional implications or statutory interpretations, I think it is a highly desirable result.I was on the Board of Maricopa County Legal Aid Society at a time when funds were difficult to come by, and the services provided to the poor simply weren't adequate because of lack of funding. I think that the increased funding is now making legal services available to the poor as well as to the rich, and I heartily favor that.

I haven't changed my mind that the Senate ought to be interested in a nominee's views. I have come to have an increasing sympathy for the problem of the nominee to respond to very legitimate questions from the Senators without in some way giving the appearance of prejudging issues that might come before him. Certainly in the sense of formulating a definition of due process, when one thinks of all of the cases that have been decided under that clause, it strikes me as virtually impossible. One can advert to settled doctrines of due process, that a confession obtained by coercion is a violation of the due process of law. That doctrine strikes me as being so well settled a nominee need have no reservation about saying that that is a classical example of it. The idea that a man is entitled to a hearing before he is deprived of substantial rights is another doctrine that strikes me as so wTell settled one need have no hesitancy in saying that.There are much closer questions of due process, I am sure, pending now in the courts that I ought not to express a view on.

Well, I would first, as is obvious, read the amendment, and you suggest that there are no precedents, yet certainly there would be cases that would be not too far off and I would be inclined to go back to the debates, the Bingham explanation of what he meant by the 14th amendment, other explanations on the floor, and I am sure you would come up with something that obviously would not have included a particular discussion of whether a trial could be televised or not.All I can think of doing is by the very best and most faithful type of analysis to see if this sort of thing was within the broad prescription that the framers and ratifiors of that amendment had in mind.

NO; I don't believe I would unless I found that to be one of the components of the due process clause.I don't think it would be right for me to simply say, this doesn't seem fair to me, therefore, I am going to find it is a violation of due process.

TO the extent that fairness is a component of due process, as a part of the debates and intent of the framers, certainly that would be taken into consideration.I think it would be wrong for me to simply read in my own subjective notions of fairness.

NO; certainly the fact that the framers of the due process clause did not contemplate specifically that trials might be televised does not foreclose the issue under the due process clauses.

Fairness in the context of the due process clause. 

I can tell you the general thought that was in my mind at that time, Senator. I am relying on recollection, and my recollection may be incorrect, as to cases or situations, but I think perhaps the thought will come across.As I recall, in the case of Mapp v. Ohio, there was a breaking1 into a house under the most objectionable sort of circumstances, without any warrant, and a simple ransacking search of the whole place. That would strike me as the kind of violation I was referring to in the second context.The technical violation I would put in terms of this case from Wyoming that came up to the Supreme Court last spring, where the sheriff in one of the Wyoming counties, on a tip from an informer, went before a magistrate to get a search warrant, rather than an arrest warrant, for two robbery defendants who were later apprehended in another part of Wyoming as a result of a statewide radio broadcast, and after the Supreme Court of Wyoming had ruled against the claim, and the district court in Wyoming and in the tenth circuit ruled against the habeas corpus eliam, the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately held that the search warrant was improperly issued because the information presented to the magistrate didn't meet the tests that it ought to meet for a search warrant.I think that was the type of thing that I had in mind when I said a technical violation.

AS far as the action of the Government agent is concerned, it is the absolute test there too. What I was referring to was not that the Government agents who may have committed a violation of law, however technical, be treated differently than some private citizen, but whether it was desirable, as a matter of policy, to apply the exclusionary rule which in effect excludes the evidence not as against the technical violator of the law, but against the person who was concededly guilty other than for the absence of the evidence to be excluded.

I think John Marshall. 

He made the Supreme Court what it is today more than any other person. I think it was Senator Fong who was commenting this morning that there are lots of countries with constitutions that have very fine charters of individual liberties and restraints on Government power, but somehow people get arrested all the time, and things just don't work out the way the constitution said they would. I think it is largely the responsibility of John Marshall and his establishment of the doctrine of judicial review which has made our Constitution a living document. 

I believe that position was taken, Senator Mathias, in the district court. I am not sure whether it was taken in the court of appeals or not.In the brief in the Supreme Court, the Government does not take the position that there is some sort of inherent power in the Executive which makes it superior to the fourth amendment. The position the Government has taken is that the executive, like every other branch of the Government, is bound by the unreasonable search and seizure restrictions of the fourth amendment, and that the question is whether this particular overhearing was or was not an unreasonable search and seizure.

Since I have described my participation in the brief, I feel I can say what my own contribution was and not any other opposing views. I felt it was a mistake for the Government to take the position that there was inherent power, and that the case could best be put forward both from the point of view of the Government in its more limited interests as an adversary and in the interests of the Government in the larger point of view by framing the case in terms of whether it was an unreasonable search and seizure under the fourth amendment, rather than some over-riding inherent power.

YOU are referring now, Senator, to the national security wiretapping, or the wiretapping under the Omnibus Crime

Under the Omnibus Crime Act, without attempting to prejudge or express an opinion on any particular case, I would think that the competing factors to be weighed are the closeness of the analogy between the traditional warrant procedure for searching premises for tangible physical evidence and the court order authorized under the Omnibus Crime Act for intercepting a conversation for a limited period of time. And basically the competing interest between the right of the individual to privacy in his conversations, privacy in his home, as opposed to the necessity or the authority of the Government in circumscribing circumstances where prior court authorization has been obtained and reasonable cause is shown to believe that incriminating evidence will be obtained for the Government to obtain that evidence. 

Well, there, of course, since the procedure is undertaken without a court authorization in advance, the question iswhether the exercise of the authority by the Attorney General and the President's designate offers a reasonably close approximation of the type of control that you get from presenting the matter to a neutral magistrate, or whether in view of the exigencies of that particular type of case, some lesser degree of neutral control can be accepted in the interest of preventing possible damage to the national security.

The position that the Department ultimately took was that it would not oppose mandatory dismissals as such if the bill were coupled with some reform in the practice of Federal habeas corpus, and were also designed to allow the system to reasonably adjust to these new time limitations in order that there wouldn't be a sudden wave of dismissals because of the inability of the system to shift to the new time schedule.

NO, it wasn't, Senator, and since one of our leading newspapers in the Nation's Capital lias presented an account from somewhere of what happened, I feel at liberty of speaking about it without the circumspection I might otherwise feel. Several of us in the Department have been working on the program. Although I was not immediately responsible for it, I was one of those who discussed it, and I think all of us unanimously felt that the mandatory dismissals imposed on the prosecution by the bill, without any concomitant sanctions imposed on the defense, was an unfairway, so far as the prosecution was concerned, of implementing the speedy trial requirement. I had occasion to be aut on the road, so to speak, and be giving a speech down at Maxwell Field, and in the discussion there it became apparent to me that a number of people who were by no means softies, if one may use that oversimplified term in the area of law enforcement,, were nonetheless concerned about the situation, where people simply languished in jail because they were unable to raise bond and weren't brought to trial within a short period of time. 

I suspect there is a good deal of truth to that. At any rate, I became convinced, after hearing this discussion, that the Department ought to shift its position and not just the criminal defendant's situation would be improved, but that the whole system of criminal justice would be improved if we somehow got a guarantee of reasonably speedy administration of criminal justice primarily at the trial level but other places elseAvhere, and that the values to be gained from such improvement clearly outweighed the probabilitythat there would be some mandatory dismissals of people who were guilty and simply weren't able to be tried in that time.

Yes sir.

If you will forgive me for being general, I will certainly try.

Well, certainly one factor is the strong public policy in favor of assuring the presence of a defendant at his trial. Once he has been indicted and arraigned.Congress has, in the Bail Reform Act of 1966, provided for a number of other less severe sanctions than the actual requirement of bail, but under the Constitution bail is nonetheless permissible.Whether or not it is excessive, 1 would take it, would depend on whether the amount fixed with an eye to actually assuring the defendant's presence at the trial.I would suppose that bail would quite arguably be excessive if it were fixed with an eye to simply keeping the man in jail rather than an .amount sufficient to reasonably assure his presence at the trial.

Well, of course, in many States my recollection is that capital offenses simply aren't baliable, and I take it the philosophy behind that is that a man who may be convicted of a capital crime has absolvtely no incentive to show up for his trial, and that, therefore, there you do not even run the risk of any sort of bail; but I think going down the scale of graduation of offenses, certainty the lighter the offense, the smaller the bail would be, is the customary way one would balance that.

Unless you can prod me with some statement of fact, I am not sure anything comes to mind as due process under the fifth amendment.

Yes, no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. I suppose that means at the very least a person to be deprived of his liberty is entitled to a hearing before a fairty constituted tribunal, to be apprised of the charges against him, to have an opportunity to present witnesses on his behalf, to have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses—again assuming this is a full-fledged criminal trial.I think if I got more particular than that I would be roaming into areas where I probably ought not to.

Well, I think the Court has held that the general rule is that a search without a warrant is unreasonable and that ordinarily in order to search, there must be a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate upon a showing of probable cause.On the other hand, there are recognized exceptions to that doctrine, as the doctrine of exigent circumstances set forth in Kerr against California.I think the classic example is that of the automobile which is very likely to be moved hj the time that the police could go and apply to a magistrate for a search warrant. There I believe the courts have said that because of that necessity, a warrant is not required, and I think that is the sort of balance the courts have tried to strike; that where a warrant is obtainable, the general rule is that a warrant is required, that it is up to the Government to justify those exceptional situations in which a warrant is not required.

AS general propositions, I have no quarrel with those at all.
