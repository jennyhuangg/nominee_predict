Yes, sir. 

I do. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I probably should begin by asking you if you can hear me as well as I can hear you.

Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, and other members of the committee, as you know, I did not ask to make a formal and preprepared statement, but I would like to accept your invitation to say a few words before our dialog together does begin. I would like to start maybe in a very obvious way simply by saying thanks for some things, to begin with, to thank every member of this committee who, in the waning and the very hectic days that you went through prior to the summer recess, nonetheless found some time to see me when I came by to meet you, in most cases for the first time. I was grateful for the reception and the courtesy that every one of you gave to me. Equally obviously, I would like simply to say here what I have already said privately this morning, or at least quietly this morning, in thanking both Senator Humphrey and Senator Rudman for their generosity to me in their introduction and their sponsorship of me before you. And I will have to continue, as I have been trying to do for the past 7 or 8 weeks now, to say some adequate thanks to the President of the United States for the confidence that he showed in me in making that nomination. I have not succeeded in doing that adequately yet, but I will keep trying. In fact, I came to the notice of probably most of you on this committee when I stood next to the President and tried—again, with great difficulty—that afternoon in late July to express some senseof the honor that I felt, despite the surprise and even shock of the event to me. It is equally incumbent on me to try to express some sense of the honor that I feel today in appearing before you, as you represent the Senate of the United States in discharging your own responsibility to review the President's nomination. I could only adopt what Senator Metzenbaum said earlier this morning about the grandeur of this process of which we are a part.I mentioned to you the great surprise that I had on July 23 in finding myself where I was. I certainly found very quickly that I had no reason to be surprised at the interest which the United States and, actually, a good deal of the world suddenly took in me as an individual. And despite the reams of paper and I suppose the forests that have fallen to produce that paper in the time between July 23, I would like to take a minute before we begin our dialog together to say something to you about how I feel about the beginnings that I have come from and about the experiences that I have had that bear on the kind of judge that I am and the kind of judge that I can be expected to be.I think you know that I spent most of my boyhood in a small town in New Hampshire—Weare, NH. It was a town large in geography, small in population. The physical space, the open space between people, however, was not matched by the interspace between them because, as everybody knows who has lived in a small town, there is a closeness of people in a small town which is unattainable anywhere else. There was in that town no section or place or neighborhood that was determined by anybody's occupation or by anybody's bank balance. Everybody knew everybody else's business, or at least thought they did. And we were, in a very true sense, intimately aware of other lives. We were aware of lives that were easy, and we were aware of lives that were very hard.Another thing that we were aware of in that place was the responsibility of people to govern themselves. It was a responsibility that they owed to themselves, and it was a responsibility that they owed and owe to their neighbors. I first learned about that or I first learned the practicalities of that when I used to go over to the town hall in Weare, NH, on town meeting day. I would sit in the benches in the back of the town hall after school, and that is where I began my lessons in practical government.As I think you know, I went to high school in Concord, NH, which is a bigger place, and I went on from there to college and to study law in Cambridge, ME, and Oxford, England, which are bigger places still. And after I had finished law school, I came back to New Hampshire, and I began the practice of law. And I think probably it is fair to say that I resumed the study of practical government.I went to work for a law firm in Concord, NH, and I practiced there for several years. I then became, as I think you know, an assistant attorney general in the criminal division of that office. I was then lucky to be deputy attorney general to Warren Rudman, and I succeeded him as attorney general in 1976.The experience of government, though, did not wait until the day came that I entered public as opposed to private law practice; because although in those years of private practice I served the private clients of the firm, I also did something in those days which51 was very common then. Perhaps it is less common today—I know it is—but it was an accepted part of private practice in those days to take on a fair share of representation of clients who did not have the money to pay.I remember very well the first day that I ever spent by myself in a courtroom. I spent in a courtroom representing a woman whose personal life had become such a shambles that she had lost the custody of her children, and she was trying to get them back. She was not the last of such clients. I represented clients with domestic relations problems who lived sometimes, it seemed to me, in appalling circumstances. I can remember representing a client who was trying to pull her life together after being evicted because she couldn't pay the rent.Although cases like that were not the cases upon which the firm paid the rent, those were not remarkable cases for lawyers in private practice in those days before governmentally funded legal services. And they were the cases that we took at that time because taking them was the only way to make good on the supposedly open door of our courts to the people who needed to get inside and to get what courts had to offer through the justice system.I think it is fair to say—I am glad it is fair to say—that even today, with so much governmentally funded legal service, there are lawyers in private practice in our profession who are doing the same thing.As you know, I did go on to public legal service, and in the course of doing that, I met not only legislators and the administrators that one finds in the government, but I began to become familiar with the criminal justice system in my State and in our Nation. I met victims and sometimes I met the survivors of victims. I met defendants. I met that train of witnesses from the clergy to con artists who passed through our system and find themselves, either willingly or unwillingly, part of a search for truth and part of a search for those results that we try to sum up with the words of justice.As you also know, after those years I became a trial judge, and my experience with the working of government and the judicial system broadened there because I was a trial judge of general jurisdiction, and I saw every sort and condition of the people of my State that a trial court of general jurisdiction is exposed to. I saw litigants in international commercial litigation for millions, and I saw children who were the unwitting victims of domestic disputes and custody fights which somehow seemed to defy any reasonable solution, however hard we worked at it.I saw, once again, the denizens of the criminal justice system, and I saw domestic litigants. I saw appellants from the juvenile justice system who were appealing their findings of delinquency. And, in fact, I had maybe one of the great experiences of my entire life in seeing week in and week out the members of the trial juries of our States who are rightly called the consciences of our communities. And I worked with them, and I learned from them, and I will never forget my days with them.When those days on the trial court were over, there were two experiences that I took away with me or two lessons that I had learned, and the lessons remain with me today. The first lesson,simple as it is, is that whatever court we are in, whatever we are doing, whether we are on a trial court or an appellate court, at the end of our task some human being is going to be affected. Some human life is going to be changed in some way by what we do, whether we do it as trial judges or whether we do it as appellate judges, as far removed from the trial arena as it is possible to be.The second lesson that I learned in that time is that if, indeed, we are going to be trial judges, whose rulings will affect the lives of other people and who are going to change their lives by what we do, we had better use every power of our minds and our hearts and our beings to get those rulings right.I am conscious of those two lessons, as I have been for all of the years that I was on an appellate course. I am conscious of them as I sit here today, suddenly finding myself the nominee of the President of the United States to undertake the greatest responsibility that any judge in our Republic can undertake: The responsibility to join with eight other people, to make the promises of the Constitution a reality for our time, and to preserve that Constitution for the generations that will follow us after we are gone from here.I am mindful of those two lessons when I tell you this: That if you believe and the Senate of the United States believes that it is right to confirm my nomination, then I will accept those responsibilities as obligations to all of the people in the United States whose lives will be affected by my stewardship of the Constitution.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I appreciate that. Thank you. 

I was a little bit. 

YOU should have been staying with him for the last 10 days. [Laughter.] 

I realize that. 

I believe that the due process clause of the 14th amendment does recognize and does protect an unenumerated right of privacy. The

The only reservation I have is a purely formal reservation in response to your question, and that simply is: No two judges, I am sure, will ever write an opinion the same way, even if they share the same principles. And I would not go so far as to say every word in Justice Harlan's opinion is something that I would adopt. And I think for reasons that we all appreciate, I would not think that it was appropriate to express a specific opinion on the exact result in Griswold, for the simple reason that as clearly as I will try to describe my views on the right of privacy, we know that the reasoning of the Court in Griswold, including opinions beyond those of Justice Harlan, are taken as obviously a predicate toward the one case which has been on everyone's mind and on everyone's lips since the moment of my nomination—Roe v. Wade, upon which the wisdom or the appropriate future of which it would be inappropriate for me to comment.But I understand from your question, and I think it is unmistakable, that what you were concerned about is the principal basis for deriving a right of privacy, and specifically the kind of reasoning that I would go through to do so. And in response to that question, yes, I would group myself in Justice Harlan's category.

I understand that. 

I think probably it would be fairest to say that it is a case in a confused line of cases and it is a case which, again referring to the approach that Justice Harlan took, it is a case which to me represents at least the beginnings of the modern effort to try to articulate an enforceable doctrine. My own personal approach to that derivation begins with, I suppose, the most elementary propositions about constitutional government, but I do not know of any other way to begin. I am mindful not only of the national Constitution of 1787, but of the history of State constitution-making in that same decade. If there is one generalization that we can clearly make, it is the generalization about the intended limitation on the scope of governmental power. When we think of the example of the national Constitution, I think truly we are at the point in our history when every schoolchild does know that the reason there was no Bill of Rights attached to the draft submitted to the States in the first instance after the convention recessed, was the view that the limitations on the power to be given to the National Government was so clearly circumscribed, that no one really needed to worry about the possible power of the National Government to invade what we55 today group under the canon of civil liberties, and we know the history of that response.We know that there were States like my own which were willing to ratify, but were willing to ratify only on the basis of requesting that the first order of business of the new Congress would be to propose a Bill of Rights in New Hampshire, like other States, who was not bashful about saying would not be in it.

If I may. This attitude did not sort of spring up without some antecedent in 1787. I am not an expert on the constitutions of all of the original States, but I do know something about my own. One of the remarkable things about the New Hampshire Constitution, which began its life at the beginning of that same decade, is the fact that it began with an extraordinarily jealous regard for civil rights, for human rights. The New Hampshire Constitution did not simply jump in and establish a form of government. They did not get to the form of government until they had gotten to the Bill of Rights first. They couched that Bill of Rights with an extraordinary breadth and a breadth which, for people concerned with principles of interpretation, requires great care in the reading. But the New Hampshire constitutionalists of 1780 and 1784 were equally concerned to protect a concept of liberty, so-called, which they did not more precisely define. So, it seems to me that the starting point for anyone who reads the Constitution seriously is that there is a concept of limited governmental power which is not simply to be identified with the enumeration of those specific rights or specifically defined rights that were later embodied in the bill. If there were any further evidence needed for this, of course, we can start with the ninth amendment. I realize how the ninth amendment has bedeviled scholars, and I wish I had something novel to contribute to the jurisprudence on it this afternoon, which I do not. 

Well, I think it is two things—maybe it is more. I have no reason to question the scholarship which has interpreted one intent of the ninth amendment as simply being the protection or the preservation of the State bills of rights which preceded it. Neither, quite frankly, do I find a basis for doubting that, with respect to the national bill of rights, it was something other than what it purported to be, and that was an acknowledgment that the enumeration was not intended to be in some sense exhaustive and in derogation of other rights retained. 

I have to count myself a member of that school, because, in any interpretive enterprise, I have to start with the text and I do not have a basis for doubting that somewhat obvious and straightforward meaning of the text.

No; my argument with the incorporation doctrine would be with the proposition that that was meant to exhaust the meaning of enforceable liberty. That, in point of fact, as you know, I mean that was Justice Harlan's concern.The next really—I mean that brings to the fore sort of the next chapter in American constitutional history that bears on what we are talking about, because one cannot talk about the privacy doctrine today, without talking about the 14th amendment.

Yes. 

I think the concept of liberty as enforceable under the due process clause is, in fact, the means by which we enforce those rights. It is sterile, I think, to go into this particular chapter of constitutional history now, but you will recall that Justice Black was a champion at one point of the view that the real point of the fourth amendment, which was intended to apply unenumerated substantive rights, was the privileges of immunities clause, and not due process. Well, as a practical matter, that was read out of the possibility of American constitutionalism, at least for its time, and it has remained so by the slaughterhouse cases. What is left, for those who were concerned to enforce the unenumerated concepts of liberty was the liberty clause and due process, and by a parity of reasoning by the search for coherence in constitutional doctrine, we would look to the same place and the same analysis in the fifth amendment when we are talking about the National Government. 

Well, my recollection—and I did not reread Eisenstadt before coming in here, so I hope my recollection is not faulty, but my recollection is that Eisenstadt represented a different approach, because the reliance on the Court there was on equal protection. I know that my recollection is

I am sorry. 

My recollection is that the criticism of Eisenstadt at the time was whether the Supreme Court was, in fact, reaching rather far to make the equal protection argument. But I think there is one point that is undeniable, without specifically affirming or denying the wisdom of Eisenstadt, and that is there is going to be an equal protection implication from whatever bedrock start privacy is derived under the concept of due process, and I think that then leads us back to the essentially difficult point of interpretation, and that is how do you go through the interpretive process to find that content which is legitimate as a concept of due process. 

I think the way, again, I would express it without getting myself into the position of endorsing the specifics of the cases, is that I believe on reliable interpretive principles there is certainly, to begin with, a core of privacy which is identified as marital privacy, and I believe it can and should be regarded as fundamental. I think what we also have to recognize is that the notion of protected privacy, which may be enforceable under the 14th amendment, has a great potential breadth and not every aspect of it may rise to a fundamental level. 

I think that assertion by Justice Powell represents a legitimate judgment in these kinds of problems with respect to Moore just as in the discussion with Griswold. I am going to ask you to excuse me from specifically endorsing the particular result, because I recognize the implications from any challenge that may come from the other privacy case that is on everyone's mind.But the one thing that I want to make very clear is that my concept of an enforceable marital right of privacy would give it fundamental importance. What the courts are doing in all of these cases is saying—although we speak of tiers of scrutiny—what the courts are saying, it seems to me in a basically straightforward way—is that there is no way to escape a valuation of the significance of the particular manifestation to privacy that we are concerned with, and having given it a value we, indeed, have to hold the State to an equally appropriate or commensurate reason before it interferes with that value.

I would assume that if we are going to have any core concept of marital privacy, that would certainly have to rank at its fundamental heart. 

I did and I have, yes. 

Yes, sir. 

Senator, that is the point at which I will have to exercise the prerogative which you were good to speak of explicitly. I think for me to start answering that question, in effect, is for me to start discussing the concept of Roe v. Wade. I would be glad—I do not think I have to do so for you—but I would be glad to explain in some detail my reasons for believing that I cannot do so, but of course, they focus on the fact that ultimately the question which you are posing is a question which is implicated by any possibility of the examination of Roe v. Wade. That, as we all know, is not only a possibility, but a likelihood that the Court may be asked to do it. 

I think to explain my position, I think it is important to bear in mind there are really two things that judges may or may not be meaning when they say there is a liberty interest to do thus and so, whatever it may be. They may mean simply that in the whole range of human interests and activities the particular action that you are referring to is one which falls within a broad concept of liberty. If liberty means what it is, we can do if we want to do it. Then obviously in that sense of your question, the answer is, yes.

I think, Senator, again, we have got to be careful about the sense of the liberty interest. There is the very broad sense of the term which I referred to before and then there is the sense of an enforceable liberty interest. That is to say, one which is enforceable against the State, based upon a valuation that it is fundamental. It seems to me that that is the question which is part of the analysis, of course, upon which Roe v. Wade rests.

But what—I am sorry. 

My answer is that the most that I can legitimately say is that in the spectrum of possible protection that would rank as an interest to be asserted under liberty, but how that interest should be evaluated, and the weight that should be given to it in determining whether there is in any or all circumstances a sufficiently countervailing governmental interest is a question with respect, I cannot answer. 

Thank you, sir. 

Well, Senator, it is difficult to make a pronouncement which is commensurate with the magnificence of the document. If I have to explain it in a few words I would do it by reference to a very limited number of concepts. The first reason for the Constitution's success is its insistence and its recognition on the source of power. The source of governmental power is the people. The second concept which has guaranteed its endurance is that that power is no more granted to government than the people grant to government. The very concept of the National Government is one of limited power, was one of its motivating, one of its very forces of life from the moment that it was presented to the people. Third, I would look to the concept implicit in that document and as a basis of the bedrock of the structural sense of American constitutionalism that power is divided and that that division of power even granted, is a division of power which must be protected if the entire Government is to remain in the place that it was intended to have. That structural sense of the division of power encompasses not only what we speak of as the separation of powers doctrine within the National Government, itself, but the concept of the distribution of power in a federal system. I think the reasons then for the remarkable and blessed endurance of the American Constitution are extraordinarily pragmatic reasons. It rests upon a recognition of where its power comes from and it is structured with a recognition that power will be abused unless it is limited and divided and restrained. 

Well, Senator, as we know—certainly you know better than I, having sat in this Congress as you have—there is a great overlap of subject matter in which we know the Congress under article I has authority, and which is equally covered by the States. We are familiar with the doctrines of preemption which have developed over the years and we are familiar, of course, with the provision of the Constitution that in cases of conflict in legislation within both the constitutional competence of the States andthe National Government, the National Government is, of course, going to prevail.One of the things that I think we have to recognize in dealing with problems of federalism today is a basic political problem which in those areas of overlap the Constitution, itself, cannot solve for us. That is a political problem that arises from the willingness or the unwillingness of the States to exercise the constitutional powers that they have to address the problems that are really before them.One of the things that I was reminded of in my preparation, my sort of autobiographical inquiry—which has preceded my coming here today and has been going on for the last 7 or 8 weeks—is a speech which I gave years ago in Newport, NH, in which I was talking about—which to most people and to me seemed—an erosion of power all in the direction of the National Government from the States.But the explanation for that erosion began with the fact that there were problems to be solved which the States simply would not address and the people wanted them addressed and therefore, the people looked to Washington. They looked to Washington, of course, because Washington had the means or exerted the means of raising the money to solve them.So one of the problems that has to be recognized, as underlying so much of the tension which sometimes gets expressed by focus on the 10th amendment, is, in fact, a political problem and ultimately a fiscal problem.We know that the concept of the 10th amendment today is something that we cannot look at with the eyes of the people who wrote it. At the very least, two developments in our constitutional history have necessarily changed the significance of the 10th amendment for us.The first, of course, is the concept of the commerce power which I think—whatever everyone's predilections may be—has grown to a, and has been recognized as having a plenary degree which would probably have astonished the Founders.The second development which has got to be borne in mind in coming to any approach to the 10th amendment is simply, the 14th. There was, very expressly, authority given to the National Government through the 14th amendment, which again, was inconceivable to the Framers of the 10th.It is those two developments that have led to the difficulty reflected in a number of cases in recent years, in trying to determine, whether in fact, there is a substantive basis, an objective basis, perhaps I should say, for identifying and protecting State power under the 10th amendment; or whether conversely, the 10th amendment, in effect, has been relegated to the expression of kind of a political truism.When I was in public practice, the case known as National League of Cities v. Usury was the law, which recognized a basis for enforcing limitation on national power in name of the 10th amendment under the wage and hour law. Subsequently National League was overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio, which has left the law, at the present time far closer to, in effect, a reflection of the politics of the Congress of the United States.I do not know what the next step in that chapter may be, but I do know that any approach to the 10th amendment today is an approach which has got to take into consideration constitutional developments outside of the 10th amendment which we cannot ignore, and, as I have said, would have astonished the Framers.

Well, I suppose for anyone in the year 1990 to speak admiringly of Marbury v. Madison is a fairly conservative act, so I don't have any trouble in sort of going out on the limb in support of Marbury v. Madison.I recognize that the difficulty which may be facing us in assessing the significance of Marbury v. Madison today is a difficulty in defining the appropriate role of Congress with respect to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. We might all hope that that kind of a contest would not come before us, but we cannot rule it out.The question, of course, is not whether Marbury can be overruled as such, but whether the force of Marbury can, in fact, be eroded by limitations upon the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. As I am sure you know as well as I, the existing precedent on that is not of very great help to us.We know that in the one case expressly addressing the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction, a post-Civil War case, McCardle, the Court seemed to say that there could be such an erosion through the exercise of congressional power, although there are times when I find McCardle a somewhat more ambiguous case than some have found it.On the other hand, we know in the Klein case that followed not long after that, which dealt with the jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts not the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, that the Supreme Court clearly put limits upon what the Congress could do in trying, in effect, to limit jurisdiction for the sake of bringing about particular results or avoiding particular results which were thought to be undesirable.But those are all post-Civil War cases. They seem to speak with conflicting and certainly not with consistent voices. And they are going to be the preface to any question about the ultimate vitality of Marbury in our time. But it is at least comforting to be able to end my response to you as I began it; that subject to that issue which has yet definitively to come before the courts, I trust everyone like me will accept Marbury as constitutionally essential to government as we know it.

Well, of, course, Senator, I cannot speak expressly for the Court, but I thi^ik those comments must have had somekind of effect. The legitimacy of that effect, the appropriateness of the Court's listening, I think has got to be assessed from two different standpoints. It is very important that courts not be swayed in any case merely by the politics of the moment. And there is, I think, a laudable tendency—I hope it will always be regarded as laudable—for the Court to keep itself above the momentary furor.It would be a mistake, however, from that, for a court to be unwilling ever to reexamine the wisdom of something that it had done. This is certainly true when we are dealing with decisions like Miranda, which are very pragmatic decisions. Whether one initially agreed or did not agree with Miranda, the point of Miranda was to produce a practical means to avoid what seemed to be unduly time consuming and sometimes intractable problems encountered in the Federal courts in dealing with claims that confessions were inadmissible on grounds of their involuntariness.But Miranda was a practical case on how to deal with it. The assumption of the Court was that if Miranda, in fact, was complied with, a lot of the very difficult voluntariness problems were just going to take care of themselves. When we are dealing with a rule like Miranda, which had a very practical objective which, as was said at the time, extended the fifth amendment to the police station for the sake of trying to avoid other more serious problems, of course it is appropriate to consider the practical effect that those decisions have. And I have no doubt that both in the briefs that have been filed before the courts and in the arguments of the specific parties, the satisfaction or the dissatisfaction of law enforcement with the practical effects of that decision have had an influence, and rightly so, on the courts.By the same token, I think it is important to note that when we look back on a decision which has been on the books as long as Miranda has now, we are faced with a similarly, I think, practical obligation, if one wants it modified or expanded or contracted, to ask very practical questions about how it actually works. That is a judicial obligation. If the judiciary is going to be imposing pragmatic rules.

Well, Senator Thurmond, I am not familiar with the bill which the Senate has passed, but I am assuming that it was probably in response to the report of the committee headed by Justice Powell a couple of years ago, retired Justice Powell, who was—the committee, rather, was addressing the problem of what you describe rightly as the seemingly endless appellate process and frequently of the confusion in haste which tended to characterize it at the Federal level.I think there was great wisdom in the recommendation of the Powell committee, because what the Powell committee centered onwas not in the first instance a strict rule of limitation, but on the problem which, in fact, was leading to the resort, frequently at the last moment, to the Federal courts in death penalty cases.What the Powell committee identified as one of those reasons was the fact that, although counsel is guaranteed to a criminal defendant through the direct appellate process, in most States counsel was, in any event, in the process of collateral review by habeas corpus after the direct appeal process had been exhausted, there was not a mandate under the national Constitution to the States to provide counsel at that level, and most States were not doing so.The practical result was that in the attempt at collateral review at the State level, death row inmates were, in fact, trying to raise constitutional issues without counsel competent to do so—they were issues of sufficient subtlety that a pro se litigant simply could not handle them—and that time was being consumed in what was really unproductive, almost helpless, litigation in State court collateral review. And it was only when that was exhausted and only when, in fact, an execution date was set that the prisoners would then find it appropriate to try to go into the Federal courts for collateral review.What the Powell Commission recommended was that if we are going to place reasonable limits on Federal collateral review, we have got to accept the reality that there has got to be some kind of genuinely significant representation by counsel at the very point collateral review can begin, so that it can be worth something both at the State level and at the moment the petitioners enter the Federal scheme. And if that can be provided, if counsel can properly be provided at the initial stages, then it is fair and appropriate to place limitations upon the time in which collateral review can be sought.I can only say that I think that is an eminently fair approach to the problem.

Well, Senator Thurmond, for someone who has never sat on the Supreme Court, there is great difficulty in answering that question, because the one thing that I think we all hear about the Supreme Court and its workload is that the combination of the task, the volume of the task, and the responsibility of the task is something for which no one really feels prepared at the beginning of service on that Court. And probably it would be impossible that anyone could be.There are at least some bits of background which I hope would fit me to work into the responsibilities of the Court as fast as possible if I am confirmed. Although the supreme court on which I sat, without question, did not have the demands on me that the Supreme Court of the United States would have, it shares the problem of all appellate courts in the United States today of having a series of requests for review which, as a practical matter, tend toexceed the capacity of the court to deal with the depth that the court would like.In New Hampshire, before I ever went on the New Hampshire Supreme Court, we had gone necessarily to a system of discretionary review because it was impossible to review every request for an appeal on the merits. So I am familiar, in fact, with the business of the Court and the need to set some kind of limits to make any worthwhile adjudication possible.More than that, though, I think the important thing is what I alluded to in the remarks that I made before the questioning began today. There is one overriding responsibility that any judge on an appellate court has. It will not guarantee that he will get the right result, but it will guarantee that he will try as best he can to get the right results. And that is a recognition that however far removed from the bench of that court, the decision that the court renders, the ruling that the court makes is going to affect a life.I have learned that lesson, and it is a lesson which, if I am confirmed, I hope will stand me in good stead.

Well, Senator, there are certainly two respects in which victims should be recognized in the system, and there is a further interest of victims which the government as a whole should recognize. The most obvious role of the victim, of course, is the role which any victim must play in establishing the fact of the crime. Your central witness, theoretically, in a criminal case is the victim. The victim also, it seems to me, has a claim to the attention of the court in a criminal case if there is, in fact, a conviction.We try to avoid disparity in sentencing, hue one of the subjects which is appropriate to bear in mind is exactly the one that you raised a moment ago, and that was: What was, in fact, the conduct of the defendant? What degree of either mild or outrageous behavior can we assign to the conduct of the defendant in relation to the victim in causing harm? The heinousness of a crime is an appropriate subject in any sentencing decision.I think going beyond that, one of the happy developments of the law in the last few years is the recognition by the government that after the criminal case is tried, whatever may be the result, the victim is still left, in many cases, in a mess not of the victim's own choosing; and that, in fact, there is a need to provide some help. The victim assistance acts which the States have been passing, it seems to me, is a step in the right direction.

Well, Senator, as you know, the doctrine of stare decisis which we speak of in that shorthanded kind of way is a series of considerations which courts bear in mind in deciding whether a prior precedent should be followed or should not be. Some such doctrine or some such rule is a bedrock necessity if we are going to have in our judicial systems anything that can be called the rule of law as opposed simply to random decisions on a case-to-case basis.The problem that the doctrine of stare decisis addresses is the problem of trying to give a proper value to a given precedent when someone asks a court to overrule it and to go another way. And I suppose the complexity of the doctrine is such that, contrary to the terms of your question, I suppose I could talk about it for a very long time. And there may be other members of the committee

I was going to say, I think you have made it very clear that that is not what you had in mind, and I don't know whether any other members of the committee may be greater bears for punishment to go into it further than you have or not. Let me, though, in compliance with your terms, just state in a very kind of outline way what I think we should look to, without meaning to be exhaustive. The first thing, kind of the threshold question that, of course, you start with on any issue or precedent, is the question of whether the prior case was wrong. We don't raise precedential issues unless we are starting with the assumption that there is something inappropriate about the prior decision. Now, that decision may have been right at the time and there now be a claim that, in fact, it is wrong to be applied now. But the first question that we have to ask is: If we were deciding the case today, if we were living in a kind of Garden of Eden and we didn't have the precedent and this was the first case, would we decide it the same way? If the answer is no, we would not do so, then we look to a series of factors to try to decide how much value we ought to put on that precedent even though it is not one that we particularly like or would think appropriate in the first instance. One of the factors which is very important I will throw together under the term of reliance. Who has relied upon that precedent, and what does that reliance count for today? Have people 

My problem, Mr. Chairman, is I forget what the question was. 

Then the answer should have been yes. I said no?

Thank you for amending that.

If you are going to ask me for a statutory interpretation, I would be as liberal as that, then you may have me in a corner. But assuming we start with a precedent which is wrong for this time, considered by itself, one of the things we are going to start by looking at is the degree and the kind of reliance that has been placed upon it. We ask in some context whether private citizens in their lives have relied upon it in their own planning to such a degree that, in fact, it would be a great hardship in overruling it now. We look to whether legislatures have relied upon it, in legislation which assumes the correctness of that precedent. We look to whether the court in question or other courts have relied upon it, in developing a body of doctrine. If a precedent, in fact, is consistent with a line of development which extends from its date to the present time, then the cost of overruling that precedent is, of course, going to be enormously greater and enormously different from what will be the case in instances in which the prior case either has not been followed or the prior case has simply been eroded, chipped away at, as we say, by later determinations. Beyond that, we look to such factors as the possibility of other means of overruling the precedent. There is some difference, although we may have trouble in weighting it, there is some difference between constitutional and statutory interpretation precedent, which Congress or a legislature can overrule, so we look to other possibilities. In all of these instances, we are trying to give a fair weight to the claim of that precedent to be followed today, even though in some respect we find it deficient on the merits. 

Senator, I hope there is no judge in the Republic who would not agree with that statement of Justice Powell. If there is one thing that

YOU are going to turn me into a laconic Yankee, if you keep doing that, Senator. [Laughter.] 

Thank you, sir. 

At the time that case was litigated, Senator, I did not know whether it was consitutional or not. That case, as I think you realize, was

There is no question that, under the law as it is understood today and under the law as I understand it, that Congress has a preferred and unique role of power in enforcing the 14th amendment under section 5.There is probably no question that there will be further years of litigation before the exact limits of that power are defined, but there are some things that are clear now. It is clear now under the law that the Congress certainly does not stand on the same footing as the State and county and local governments may do in devising remedies for a broader societal discrimination than may come to light in specific cases. We know that the Congress has a preferred position in that respect.

I came to no comprehensive personal view of section 5 at that time. The views that I came to grips with at that time were these: The first, of course, is that I was representing a client. The issue before me, as a lawyer in that case, was whether the client, whose policy was being set by the executive branch, speaking through the Governor, had a legitimate position which could in good faith be pressed before the courts. It was my judgment at that time that the State did, in fact, have a case which could be pressed in defense of the Governor's position.The most remarkable thing about it and the reason for coming to this conclusion which I drew as a lawyer, is indicated in an unusual way in our constitutional history. In a footnote in a later opinion by Justice Powell that came about years later—and I cannot cite itfrom memory, but I can produce it, if you would like—Justice Powell referred to a survey of discrimination by State and local governments on racial grounds, and I do not recall now whether it was strictly State employment discrimination or discrimination in voting, but it illustrated the truth that lay behind the decision that New Hampshire could take that position and press it before the courts, for whatever disposition, and that determination was that there was no indication that there had ever been racial discrimination, what we would today broadly call title VII discrimination, by the State or local governments.The issue that the Governor wished and the State wished to press forward was whether the power of section 5 of the 14th amendment, whether the congressional power could in fact be used to require the assembly of racial data by a governmental entity with respect to whom there was absolutely no historical indication of any discrimination.As I think you know from the briefs which I know have been brought to your attention, one of the concerns raised is that if you have not been thinking in racial terms and you are suddenly forced to start classifying nor at least to classify statistically in racial terms, you are running the risk that race is, in fact, going to play a role and a wrong role, which it has never done.The issue before me, as attorney general of New Hampshire, in carrying on with that litigation which had in fact begun before I became attorney general, was whether in fact there was an argument that could be made to that effect. I believed that there was an argument that could be made to that effect. The courts rejected it and it is, of course, not an argument that would be made today.

The question that I thought could be legitimately raised at the time was whether, in fact, as against a governmental entity which had not practiced any discrimination, either specific or reflective of societal discrimination, that was an appropriate exercise of section 5 power. I think we now know very clearly that it is.

As you indicate, I think the 14th amendment is about both.

I think, in fact, the answer to that is one which, with respect, I would almost have to direct to my client. If you were to ask me cold whether the State was filing gender information at that time, I could not have told you. 

I think they were suspended, were they not, for 5 years by the 1970 amendments? 

I was assistant attorney general at that time, and my recollection is that I filed aposttrial memorandum with the U.S. district court after that case was argued. I remember I was the assistant attorney general assigned to argue 

Pardon me? 

I was not trying to get you to read the names off, Senator. 

Well, with respect, Senator, let me address acouple of points that you raise. Maybe the best place to start iswith the fundamental one. That is about me today, as opposed tome as an advocate in a voting rights case 20 years ago.I hope one thing will be clear and this is maybe the time to makeit clear, and that is that with respect to the societal problems ofthe United States today there is none which, in my judgment, ismore tragic or more demanding of the efforts of every American inthe Congress and out of the Congress than the removal of societaldiscrimination in matters of race and in the matters of invidiousdiscrimination which we are unfortunately too familiar with.That, I hope, when these hearings are over, will be taken as agiven with respect to my set of values.The second thing that I think must be said, with respect to thatcase of 20 years ago, is that I was not giving an interpretation 20years ago. I was acting as an advocate, as a lawyer, in asserting aposition on behalf of a client. Maybe it is unnecessary to add, but Iknow that you recognize that the identity of the Governor hasnothing to do with the responsibility of the attorney general tobring a case.This voting rights case, by the way, did not arise during the ad-ministration of the Governor that you have just been referring to.It arose during the Peterson administration which preceded his.The issue that was presented to the State was, in one respect, simi-lar to one we have already discussed.New Hampshire had a literacy test. The literacy test had neverbeen used or, indeed, ever have been claimed to have been used forany discriminatory purposes whatsoever. There is some question asto what its practical effect was in those days. But it had never been used for discrimination.There was one thing that we did know very clearly about the law in those days, and that was that the use of a literacy test for a nondiscriminatory purpose was constitutional under the 14th amendment. That had been litigated.So that New Hampshire's practice was, in fact, a wholly constitutional practice. The issue which the Governor requested the attorney general to raise was: Is it within the power of Congress, under section 5, to suspend a literacy test in a State in which there is absolutely no history or evidence of any sort, at any time, of its discriminatory use, in such a way as to be unconstitutional under the 14th amendment?That issue was not ultimately decided until about 4 or 5 months after our case began. That issue was decided in Oregon v. Mitchell, and as you indicated a moment ago, the Court under varying rationales—some under 14th and some under 15th amendment analyses—decided that it was, in fact, within the power of the Congress to deal with literacy and the discrimination frequently associated with it, as a national problem, and to suspend the test without regard to any particular history of discrimination in the States.But that case had not been decided at the time that ours was brought. Therefore, the attorney general at the time was in the position, No. 1, of being requested by the Governor to defend a constitutional action under existing State law. I think that was within the appropriate role of an advocate, and it did not represent a personal opinion, either by the attorney general or anyone else involved in the litigation about the ultimate scope of Congress' power under section 5.

That is correct. 

Well, Senator, I think you have answered that question. Where we were then, where the attorney general was and where I was as an assistant attorney general in that case was in defending a State practice which the Supreme Court of the United States had ruled to be constitutional under the 14th amendment. I think that cannot be reasonably regarded as a derogation of the duty of the State to its people. It may have turned out to be a legal position which the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately rejected, but I think it is a defensible one. 

No. That is not my position. My position which was described in that, which was raised as an advocate in that brief, went to a problem which is a problem that is still with us. It is a problem which anyone who is concerned about sex discrimination and the appropriate standard of review, I think has got to face.What we are dealing with when we are asking what is the appropriate standard of review in an equal protection case is what kind of pragmatic approach should we adopt in order to find whether there is or is not a defensible classification?As you have pointed out, we have come up with, or the courts have come up with basically three tiers of review, so that the courts do not have to reinvent the wheel in every case.Economic matters get the lowest scrutiny, and racial matters get the highest. The difficulty which has bedeviled the middle scrutiny test, under which classifications of sex and illegitimacy have been examined, is the looseness of the test.The rational basis test is fairly easy to understand. The strict scrutiny test is fairly easy to understand but the middle scrutiny test requires the court to determine whether there is a substantial relationship to an important governmental objective in deciding whether or not a discrimination, a classification on the basis of sex is appropriate.What is unfortunate about that standard of review is that it leaves an enormous amount of leeway to the discretion of the court that is doing the reviewing. The history of the middle-tier test illustrates this because we know there are examples, both State and Federal, in which the middle-tier test, in fact, has been treated as nothing more than the first-tier rational basis test—the lowest basis for scrutiny.I think the question that has got to be faced is whether there can be devised a middle-tier test providing a higher level of scrutiny for these classifications on the basis of sex and illegitimacy that does not suffer from the capacity of a court, as a practical matter, to read it back down to the lowest level of scrutiny, if it is inclined to do so.The trouble with the middle-tier test is that it is not a good, sound protection. It is too loose.

No, I was just going to add, that has nothing to do with the question of whether sex discrimination should receive heightened scrutiny. I think that is to compare sex discriminations with common economic determinations seems to me totally inappropriate. The question is, what is a workable and dependable middle-tier standard for scrutiny. 

Well, I also talked about making the test more clear and eliminating this kind of protean quantity to it.

The Opinions of both the Circuit Ccrj^t and the District Court held that New Hampshire's statutory rape law (RSA 632:1, I-c) , under which Respondent was convicted, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Respondent, Thomas E. Meloon, and the proseeutrix, Susan D. Souriolle, first met in Portsmouth, New Hampshire during late August or early September of 1973, At the time of this meeting, the prosecutrix- 7-was thirteen years of age; the Respondent \.was twenty-four. On three separate occasions thereafter, the Respondent and the prosecutrix engaged in consensual sexual intercourse, Respondent was then arrested, charged,ndicted, and on May 21, 1974, convicted of statutory rape pursuant to New Hampshire RSA 632:1, I-c. (This statute was repealed and replaced on August 6, 1975, with RSA 632-A, a gender neutral law.)Respondent's conviction was upheld on direct appeal to the New Hampshire Supreme Court, which considered and explicitly rejected Respondent's equal protection claims. See Appendix C. However, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire subsequently granted Respondent a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that New Hampshire's statutory rape91 - 8-law, USA 632:1, I-c, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Court of Appeals thenafi'JLmieu. Petitioners respectfully submitthat the decisions of the District Courtand the Court of Appeals are erroneous.- 10 -These decisions present this Court with the unique opportunity not only to address the first impression issue of the constitutionality of a gender based statutory rape law vis-a-vis the Equal Protection Clause, but also to reanalyze and clarify the unsettled question of what is the correct equal protection test to apply to statutory classifications based on sex.Few areas of the law have troubled this Court as much in recent years as has the problem of testing statutory classifications based on sex against the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment • There are, of course, two traditional tests to which constitutionally challenged statutes under the Equal Protection Clause have been subjected — rational basis and strict scrutiny. Under the rational basis- 11 -standard a state is entitled to make reasonable classifications among persons upon 4 whom benefits are conferred or burdens inposed, and the equal protection safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achieve"ment of the state's objective. See, e.g., Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 484-485 (1970); McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 425-426 (1961); and W-m -?amson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 488-489 (1955)*,The strict scrutiny test is imposed if the statutory distinction is based upon a "suspect classification" such as race, alienage, or nationality, (Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967); Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365 (1971); and Qyama v. California. 332 U.S. 633 (1948)) or if the distinction infringes a "fundamental- 12 -interest." Dunn v. Blumstein, ^05 U.S. 330 (1972); and Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (19^2) . To successfully withstand the strict scrutiny test, a state must demonstrate a "compelling state interest" in creating the challenged classifications. Skinner v. Oklahoma, supra.Where the statutory classification under consideration has been based on sex, however, this Court has been unwilling to apply either of the traditional tests. Instead, the Court has resorted to an amorphous "substantial relation cest which requires more heightened scrutiny than would be applied under -the rational basis standard, but less strinjrent scrutiny than is applied to suspect legislation.T: r^^^le-tier approach began to evolve in Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71- 13 -(1971) . The Court, in striking down aprobate statute which gave males a pre-ferred position as executors, stated:"A classification 'must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced Shall be treated alike.ftT Reed v. Reed, supra, at 76. (citation omitted)The rationale of the Reed decisionprovided the underpinning for subsequentholdings which invalidated statutesemploying gender as an inaccurate proxyfor more germane bases of classificationand which rejected administrative ease andconvenience as sufficiently importantobjectives to justify gender-based distinc-tions. See, Stanton v. Stan ton, t*21 U.S.7 (1975); Weinberger v. Wisenfeld, t*20 U.S,97 - 14 -636 (1975); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S.522 (1975); and Stanley v. Illinois, 405U.S. 645 (1972). In other cases the Court,applying in some instances the traditionalrational basis test and in others the substantial relation test of Reed, found thatcertain classifications challenged assexually discriminatory were in fact basedon functional or circumstantial differencesbetween the sexes; therefore no violationof the Equal Protection Clause existed.See, General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,U.S., 97 S. Ct. 401 (1976);Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975);Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484 (1974); andKahn v. Shevin, 416 U.S. 351 (1974).In Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), four Justices went so far asto conclude that sex should be regarded as- 15 -a suspect classification. Since Frontiero,, however, the Court has not only declined tohold that sex is a suspect class, but it hassignificantly retreated from that position.See, Califano v. Goldfarb,U.S. ,"97 S. Ct. 1021 (1977); General Electric Co.v. Gilbert, supra; Craig v. Boren, M29 U.S.190 (1976); and Mathews v. Lucas, t*27 U.S.495 (1976). The most relevant precedent for the ;instant case is Craig v. Boren, supra, theonly Supreme Court gender-based discrimina-tion case concerning a criminal statute.In Craig, the Court examined and struckdown an Oklahoma statute which prohibitedthe sale of 3,2% beer to males under theage of 21 and females under the age of 18.The majority applied the substantial rela-tion test from Reed, but three Justices99 - 16 -expressed outward concern with this standard.Justice Powell» in a concurring opinion,indicated that the rational basis testshould take on a "sharper focus" when'addressing a gender-based classification,but he balked at characterizing the newtest as an independent "middle-tier"approach. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190,S. Ct. 451, 464 (1976). In separate/'dissenting opinions, both Chief JusticeBurger and Justice Rehnquist expressedtheir position that gender based cases,like all cases where no suspect classifica-tion or fundamental interest is involved,should be tested by the traditional rationalbasis standard. Craig v. Boren, supra, at466, 467, 469. Justice Rehnquist went onto express his concern that the substantialrelation test is "so diaphanous and elastic100 - 17 -as to invite subjective judicial preferences or prejudices relating to particular types of ^legislation . . . ." Craig v. Boren, supra, at 467, 468.In the instant case the Court of Appeals was troubled by the amoebic quality of the substantial relation test. Chief Judge Coffin comments that it is "hardly a precise standard," and he worries that "we' must decide the constitutionality of the New Hampshire statute under a test that to some indeterminate extent requires more of a connection between classification and governmental objective than that of the minimal rationality standard." Meloon v. Helgemoe, supra, at 604.Despite the First Circuit's misgivings over the imprecision of the Reed substantial relation test, the Court found thav the New- 18 -Hampshire statute could not pass muster uneler that test. This decision is made even more suspect by the First Circuit's suggestion that the Court would not have struck down the statute under the "minimal rationality test," Meloon v. Helgemoe, supra, at 606.In sum, this Court has created a new equal protection test which resides somewhere in the "twilight zone" between the rationale basis and strict scrutiny tests. This new standard lacks definition, shape, or precise limits. The instant case is a perfect example of what Justice Rehnquist feared most - the abuse of a standard so "diaphanous and elastic" as to permit subjective judicial preferences and orejudices concerning particular- 19 -legislation. The instant case represents an opportunity for the Court to define, shape, limit, or even eliminate the new standard. In all events, it presents the opportunity for the Court to correct a situation which invites subjective judicial judgments and possible abuses.Finally, as noted above, the instant case is one of first impression. Never has this Court weighed a gender-based statutory rape law against an equal protection argument. The implications of the First Circuit's Decision for all genderbased criminal statutes and for equal protection analysis in general are devastating. The decision should not be left to the Court of Appeals. The issue is substantial and worthy of this Court's- 20 -cons ideration. II. THE HOLDING OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH A DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND WITH THE DECISIONS OF ALL OTHER STATE COURTS WHICH HAVE CONSIDERED THE QUESTION. During the course of Respondent'sdirect appeal to the New Hanpshire Supreme Court, he first raised the issue of whether RSA 632:l,I-c was violative of the Equal Protection Clause. The Court considered Respondent's argument and in a unanimous decision explicitly rejected it* State v. Meloon> supra» at 670, 671.The New Hampshire Supreme Court does not stand alone. On the contrary, equal protection attacks against statutory rape laws have been universally rejected by every state court considering the question.- 21 -See, e.g., People v. Mackey, 46 Cal.

I do not think there is any question about it. 

I appreciate your concerns. 

Yes, sir? 

Well, I suppose there has got to be. It seems to me impossible to say that unless you are within those basically four categories that get the very strict scrutiny—race, alienage, national origin, fundamental rights—that there is no appropriate level of review except that bottom level of review which is reserved for basically the most garden-variety economic distinctions. That kind of a position seems to me not to take into account the variety of the importance of the interests that fall between them. 

There has got to be something other than just threshold level scrutiny. 

The tough thing is in writing—I have been saying and I will say it again—the tough thing is in finding—is in writing a test that does not have the undue flexibility in the middle. 

Yes, sir. 

I believe that was the first year, 1972 or 1973, yes. 

My esteemed former colleague, Senator Rudman. I would not want to suggest that Senator Rudman counseled any executive decision on that. 

That is correct. 

I believe that was correct. 

I do not remember. I do not specifically remember. 

YOU are a better student of my history than I am. 

I recall that. 

My best recollection is that the notice of appeal probably had been filed before I became attorney general, but I would have to check the dates. 

That is right. I was still deputy at that time. 

I think it was January 20 of the next year, 1976. 

That is correct. 

That is my understanding. 

That is correct. 

Yes, sir. 

That is correct. 

That is correct. 

We did the best we could, Senator. 

Thank you. [Laughter.] 

Yes; I think by that time an order had been entered against the State. 

When the case was over, it was over. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I would stipulate to that. 

I was going to say I think he would be a great Justice, too. I thought it was a question of him against me, and under those circumstances. [Laughter.] 

Yes; it had. The use of a literacy test for a nondiscriminatory purpose had been affirmed by the Supreme Court. 

Yes. It was a requirement, and I don't think this was the point of any question so far. But needless to say, no one had authority to suspend the imposition of that literacy test except a court of competent jurisdiction. 

I believe that is correct. 

That is correct.

Yes, sir. 

Yes; we were. 

The only case, Senator, in which our responsibility would have been different from the way we saw it would have been a case in which the national and State constitutions clearly conflicted. And in those circumstances, our oaths would have required us, if we so believed—and we believed that there was no reasonable argument that could have been made to defend the State position—our obligation would have been to state that to the court. We did not find ourselves to believe that we were in that position. 

Yes. That was being litigated, and it was a final determination on that, or at least on the issues that concerned us, came with Oregon v. Mitchell, which was decided, I think, about 4 months after our own State case. 

Yes; it was. 

Yes; they were at an injunction stage, and they made that judgment. 

Yes. My recollection is that after Oregon v. Mitchell came down I believe there was a joint stipulation filed by the State and Federal counsel, which ended the case. 

That is correct. 

That is correct. 

That is correct. 

Thank you, Senator. 

We did. 

Thank you, Senator. 

I could have been a very successful lawyer. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Anything that can come before a trial court of general jurisdiction. 

Yes, I have. 

Well, do you want me to refer to the trial court experience as well as appellate court? 

Well, the process is one which helps to discipline the mind as we go through it. I will leave aside the question of determining whether there should be discretionary review in a given case and start with the point at which the case is docketed before the court. In the normal course, sometime in the month before the case is going, to be argued, we get a set of briefs. My practice would be usually in the week or the weekend before the argument to read those briefs through, to make notes on the covers of the briefs of questions that I want to ask. And also, as a matter of curiosity, to try to settle a lawyer's argument, I engaged in a practice for the last couple of years of trying to get some sense in a way that I could measure of the effect of the oral argument on me, which would come after the briefs had been read. What I would do after I had read the briefs and noted the questions that I knew that I wanted to ask counsel, I would make a notation on my docket list, which I kept in my own file, of what I thought was the strongest position at the time, a kind of first, even prestraw-poll indication of where I thought I might come out on the case. Following the oral argument in the case, I would then compare my determination after oral argument with that first indication that I had put on the docket list. One of the things that I wish I had done before I came down here and I didn't think to do was to try to go down to my chambers and pull out my old docket lists and tabulate those points at which I had had some change of decision from the preliminary to the postargument decision. But I did change my mind in enough cases so that I remember there are enough little x's in the margin to indicate that the second look after argument suggested something that the first look before argument had not, to indicate to me that oral argument was a matter of substantial importance to me in deciding cases.I would then, following that oral argument, of course, go through a preliminary discussion of the case and a preliminary vote with the other justices. We would decide how the case probably would come out, and the case in the New Hampshire Supreme Court would be assigned randomly. And if I got the case, I would then start working on the opinion.The way I happen to work on opinions was to ask a law clerk whom I would assign to that particular case to draft an opinion which followed a rough outline that I would give the clerk of the points that I wanted to cover and the basic reasoning that I wanted to go through. What I wanted the clerk to do was not to write me an opinion which I was necessarily going to use—because, in fact, on the New Hampshire Supreme Court I never did use a clerk's draft ultimately. What I wanted the clerk to do was, in effect, to make the run-through, help me with the research, reduce down the amount of reading that I personally had to do of the most important authorities, and to give a further preliminary look at whether there was some flaw in our reasoning that I was not catching or that the other judges in the majority with me were not catching.After I would get the clerk's draft back—we may or may not have argued about it in the meantime. But after the clerk's draft came back, I would then work my way through the briefs again. I would read the portions of the record sent up to us that were germane to the decision. I would then go through my own research process of rereading cases, even though I might think I was familiar with them, that the parties had relied on.At that point, I would make a final assessment myself as to whether there was any reason to change my view from what it had been when the court voted. If there was, I would either go back to the court or I would draft an opinion indicating the change and circulate that and explain why I was doing it. If there was no change, I would then write my own opinion. I would revise it an unfortunate number of times. And then I would let the clerk have a go at it again, and the clerk would try to tear it to pieces. Usually, another clerk would review it then, and ultimately it would circulate to the rest of the court, at which point I might or might not be in trouble. But that was at least the process that I went through up to there.

Thank you, Senator. 

No, I am fine. Thank you, sir. I was offered anything I needed out back. 

That is the third lesson I learned as a judge. [Laughter.] 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator, your question comes as a surprise to me. I was not expecting that kind of question, and you have made me think of something that I have not thought of for 24 years.When I was in law school, I was on the board of freshmen advisers at Harvard College. I was a proctor in a dormitory at Harvard College. One afternoon, one of the freshmen who was assigned to me, I was his adviser, came to me and he was in pretty rough emotional shape and we shut the door and sat down, and he told me that his girlfriend was pregnant and he said she is about to try to have a self-abortion and she does not know how to do it. He said she is afraid to tell her parents what has happened and she is afraid to go to the health services, and he said will you talk to her, and I did.I know you will respect the privacy of the people involved, and I will not try to say what I told her. But I spent 2 hours in a small dormitory bedroom that afternoon, in that room because that was the most private place we could get so that no one in the next suite of rooms could hear, listening to her and trying to counsel her to approach her problem in a way different from what she was doing, and your question has brought that back to me.I think the only thing I can add to that is I know what you were trying to tell me, because I remember that afternoon.

If they were to ask me whether I could, I would ask them to imagine what it was like to be in that room that fall afternoon that I described to you. That is an experience which has not been on my mind, because it has not had to be, but I learned that afternoon what was at stake.I hope I have learned since that afternoon what is at stake on both sides of this controversy. You mentioned my opinion in the Smith v. Cody case. I do not know whether that was dictum or not. I did not think it was at the time.What I thought I was addressing at the time was as moral dilemma which had been created not unnecessarily, but which had necessarily been raised by the majority opinion of my court.If I were to generalize from that concurrence in Smith v. Cody, it would be that I believe I, indeed, can empathize with the moral force of the people whom I addressed, and I can with equal empathy appreciate the moral force of people on the other side of that controversy.

I think I have to go back to something that I said to all of the members of the committee when I was speaking at the very beginning, before my testimony this afternoon.If I have learned one thing, I have learned that whatever we do on any appellate court is not, just as you said it was not, just a case. It affects someone and it changes someone's life, no matter what we do.One of the consequences undeniably of the situation that you describe would be an inconsistency of legal opportunity throughout this country. Some States would go one way, others would go another. Some would fund abortions, some would not fund abortions. There is no question that that is a consequence that has to be faced.I do not think that, any more than any other given fact, as tragic as that fact may be, is sufficient to decide a case. We can never decide a case totally that way, and I know you are not suggesting otherwise.But you remember what I said is the second lesson that I learned as a trial judge, that knowing that any decision we make is going to affect a life and perhaps many lives, we had better use every resource of our minds and our hearts and every strength that we have to get it right. It is the imperative for conscientious judging.

There is no question that the decision about the future of Roe v. Wade does not rest upon an assessment of a physician's moral scruples. The issue of Roe v. Wade is one which, as you know, on the merits I cannot comment on.But there is one thing that I can say, and I do not know how else to say it, is that whatever its proper resolution may be, it is an issue. It is not simply a label for one view, whether that view be in favor of continuing Roe v. Wade or in favor of overruling it.You are asking me at this point have I demonstrated, can I point to something on the record that demonstrates as kind of equality of empathy on either side, and I think the only thing that I can, without self-serving rhetoric, say to you is I have talked and I have counseled with someone on the other side.I have been the trustee of a hospital which has opened its facilities to people on the other side, people who did not agree with these conscientious doctors, and to the extent that I have a record that goes behind the legal issue in the case, I think you may properly look to that. And you may properly ask, and I hope you will ask yourself, as you and the other members of this committee listen to me over the course of the next few days, you may properly ask whether, on other issues generally, I am open enough to listen.What you want to avoid is a judge who will not listen, and I will ask you when these hearings are over to make a judgment on me as to whether I will listen or not. I think I have a record as a judge which indicates that I will, and after you and the other members of39-454—91-this committee have finished examining it, I will ask you to judge me on that basis.

I think the only answer to that, Senator, is a reference back to the laws that preceded Roe. We know that in my own State there were misdemeanor statutes on the book for procuring an abortion. And it was exactly such statutes as that that Roe rendered unenforceable. 

I was going to say it was exactly such statutes as that that Roe rendered unenforceable. 

I do not recall the memo, no. 

The fact is I cannot give you a categorical answer to that. To begin with, it is an issue that I have not even given thought to for, I guess, 17 years and I do not recall the extent to which I may have been aware of that memorandum at the time. The further reason for the difficulty and a categorical answer is that you may recall that there are questions about the effect of Roeor the Roe-type decisions depending on the form of the State statutes in question.Now, I am going to say something from memory and it may be inaccurate, so I want you to take it with that disclaimer. But my recollection is that the Court's indication of the enforceability of the statute in Roe v. Wade was different from its indication of the enforceability that came out of Doe v. Bolton.Quite frankly, Senator, without a reexamination of precisely what they were saying on whether the statute remained partially enforceable to the extent allowable under Roe v. Wade as opposed to becoming totally unenforceable, I would have to go back and reread those carefully and parse the New Hampshire statutes, which I have not done.It is—in one sense I think we are inclined to say, well, that ought to be an easy question, and I do not think it is an easy question.

I have never discussed the issue in question with Governor Sununu. After Governor Sununu came to Washington, I did not see him until one day last December. I think it may have been around the 11th or the 12th. I was in Washington that day inconnection with the nomination or the possible nomination to the court of appeals.The Governor invited me to lunch and I did have lunch with him. We did not discuss any substantive issue that his memorandum referred to. We largely, as I recall, talked politics in New Hampshire. I did not see the Governor again until the day before this nomination.I did not have discussions with him on the issue that you referred to.

I was going to just try to establish how far back in time we want to go with Governor Sununu.

NO. I just wanted to know how far back you want to go in time? To the beginning? 

I have not discussed that issue or given any assurance to Governor Sununu. I presume that Governor Sununu was drawing a conclusion based on what he understood to be principles of judging* But I can assure you that I gave no assurance to him at any time on that matter. And I did not discuss that matter with him at any time. 

The only discussion that I had with anyone at the White House in connection with this nomination or, for that matter the circuit nomination, was my conversation with the President which I think lasted about a half an hour on the afternoon that he announced his intent to nominate me. He asked for no assurance on any subject.

NO, Senator. The only conversation I had or conversations, I should say, plural, with anyone at the White House at that time, was during the course of the lunch that I mentioned. Governor Sununu—the lunch was in Governor Sununu's office. He was there and his assistant was there; the Governor's legal counsel, Mr. Gray, and Lee Liverman, who is on his staff.I was not asked for any statement of position or assurance on any issue in that conversation.

Thank you, sir. 

If they were reading my opinions, they were. 

Thank you, sir. 

The answer is, no. 

Well, far be it for me to say that a question from you, Senator, is crazy. [Laughter.] 

In a way, I think that answer might have been impressive to some people if I had grown up in a place with racial problems, and some people have pointed out that I did not. The State of New Hampshire does not have racial problems. So you can ask, well, what indication is there, really, as to whether you mean it or not. And you did not provoke this thinking on my part by your question immediately because I thought of it before I came in here. I can think of two things to say. The first is something very personal and very specific to my family. In a way, it surprises me when I look back on the years when I was growing up that never once, ever in my house that I can remember did I ever hear my mother or my father refer to any human being in terms of racial or ethnic identity. I have heard all the slang terms and I never heard them in my house. Now, as much as I esteem my family, I do not want to try to make them a race of saints, but the fact is, in that respect, they123 were perfect. They were perfect in some other ways, too, but they were in that respect.And if there is a kind of homely vision for America, in my mind, it is simply the vision of my home. And I have lived long enough and I have lived outside of my home long enough to know what the difference is. I am glad that I am conditioned by my beginnings and I am glad that I do not have to overcome them. I am glad that I can have an aspiration for America which is as good as the circumstances that I came from.Another thing that occurred to me, and it is equally personal— and I think that I will not offend the two people involved by saying this—two of my closest friends in this world are sitting in the row behind me. You have already heard from Warren Rudman. I heard Warren Rudman talk about what it was like to be discriminated against when he was a kid because he was Jewish. Somewhere out there, there is somebody who is discriminating against a friend of mine who is close enough to me to be a brother.And there is another friend of mine in that category in the row behind me; you haven't heard from him today. His name is Thomas Rath. I can remember Tom Rath telling me once years ago—I don't know why, I don't know how it came up. I remember him telling me about his grandparents, and his grandparents remembered the days when there were help-wanted signs up around the city of Boston that said "No Irish need apply." And that meant them.So if you want to know whether I have got the vision, if you will, behind the answer to my question, I will be content to have you look to my friends.

Yes, sir. 

If I had to pick one thing—you have already mentioned it—it would be that hospital board. It was like a second occupation for me. I went on it the way lots of people went on it. Somebody asked me to go on it. You say, well, why do you do it? Why do you do any of those things? You do it because you are paying your dues. You are in the group that is lucky. And the people in the group that are lucky have got an obligation to pay it back. And so we go on boards like that.Then the activities start taking sort of lives of their own. I went on in an unassuming way. I was a quiet trustee for a couple of years. Sooner or later, it became obvious that we were outgrowing a building, and in kind of an innocuous way, a lawyer who was a mentor of mine said, "Well, why don't you go on the planning committee and just make sure we don't do something foolish?" And I said, "Well, yes, I will do that."By increments, by short steps, I finally found myself back in the years when I first went on the superior court as the chairman or, as we called it, the president of the board. And I saw all sorts of conditions of people in doing that. We dealt with a regulatory bureaucracy because we could no longer just go out and build what we thought we needed. We dealt with a health care bureaucracy because whatever we built was going to affect the cost of health care throughout the State of New Hampshire. We dealt with the fact that there were people out there who did not have health insurance and who might or might not be eligible for governmental health benefits.Once a year, we all trotted around to the town meetings. I remember standing up in the town meeting of my town telling how much money the hospital had given away in free care in that town every year because there was a neighborhood tradition around there that the towns would chip in to offset the costs that the hospital would otherwise have to drain out of an endowment or recoup by raising rates to the people who did pay. So we all knew exactly what it was costing. We knew what it was costing our neighbors. We knew what health care was costing the people who couldn't pay for it. We knew what it was going to do to the cost of health care throughout the State when we had to build a building. And we finished, ultimately we finished the job.I am glad I did that. There are many other things, I suppose, that I might have done that would have given equal satisfaction. The reason it gave satisfaction I think is simply that in ways I never dreamed it would it was paying the dues. And I had a lot of dues to pay, and I got a chance to pay them.

I did some back in the time when I was in private practice. Of course, I couldn't do that as a public lawyer.

That is why Senator Rudman and I have always gotten along so well. I listen. [Laughter.]

Thank you, Senator. 

NO, sir. 

That is a fair assessment. The only concern that I have expressed, and Senator Kennedy alluded to it in the course of his questioning, is whether any of us could do a better job in trying to articulate the middle-tier scrutiny. As I said, what the courts are trying to get at, whether it be the Federal courts under the 14th amendment or the State courts under their own equal protection guarantees, is a way of approaching classifications which the law makes which is going to, in effect, weight the State's interests or channel the question of trying to weight the appropriate State interest to determine whether there is a real justification for the classification in question. Trivial interests are not going to require tremendous overbalancing by the interests of the State. Fundamental interests do. What the courts are doing by coming up with a three-tier test is in trying to give some structure to this enterprise, so that in each case the courts at least can begin, and particularly the trial courts, can begin by saying, all right, we know roughly what the State counterweight must be, once we know how the particular private interest is to be classified, and the concern, as I said a minute ago, with the middle-tier test—and, by the way, we use it in New Hampshire, so I have expressed this concern only in terms of the128 State Constitution in my own judicial writing—is whether we can come up with some kind of a standard which is less subjective, because the experience has been that the middle-tier standard tends to shade down into the first-tier standard, and if that happens, somebody with a classification claim is going to get shortchanged.

No, the 

Well, the Supreme Court's approach to that has been—and it was described very concisely in the Court's opinion in the Kleburn v. Living Center case—is to indicate that there were two factors foremost in their mind in putting the sex discrimination classifications in the middle-tier category. One was the likelihood that a classification might really have a legitimate reason behind it, a legitimate basis, and the case law, the experience with the cases coming up in the Court's view has simply been that there is greater chance that there may be a legitimate basis for some sex classification, in other words that it may not amount to invidious discrimination than would be the case in the racial area. The second thing that the Court has pointed to and, as I recall, did in the Kleburn case, is the likelihood that individuals against whom there really has been a discrimination have some effective political process by which to counter it, as well. And the Court, if I understood or recall correctly, the Court's opinion, the indication was that, in the area of sex discrimination, there was more likely to be some political responsiveness than our history has shown in racial discrimination, so that is why they put it in the middle. 

I do remember that, yes, sir. 

Senator, I think the first thing that has to be understood about that dissenting opinion is that, whether it was written clearly or not, I referred to the test of—I believe I referred to the test of original meaning or original understanding of the terms. I have tended to shy away from the use of the term "original intent" in describing any approach of mine. I have done so, because the phrase "original intent" has frequently been used to mean that the meaning or the application of a constitutional provision should be confined only to those specific examples that were intended tobe the objects of its application when it was, in fact, adopted. It is a kind of a

That is exactly right. I do not believe that the appropriate criterion of constitutional meaning is this sense of specific intent, that you may never apply a provision to any subject except the subject specifically intended by the people who adopted it. I suppose the most spectacular example of the significance of this is the case of Brown v. Board of Education. That case, I am glad to say, we may safely say that that particular principle is never going to come before the Court in any foreseeable future in my lifetime and we can talk about it. The equal protection clause was appropriately applied in Brown v. Board of Education.If you were to confine the equal protection clause only to those subjects which its Framers and its adopters intended it to apply to, it could not have been applied to school desegregation. I think it is historically accepted by people of all schools that it is a historical fact that those who proposed and those who adopted the 14th amendment never intended to require integrated schools. The Brown opinion itself alludes to that.The reason Brown was correctly decided is not because they intended to apply the equal protection clause to school desegregation, but because they did not confine the equal protection clause to those specific or a specifically enumerated list of applications, the equal protection clause is, by its very terms, a clause of general application.What we are looking for, then, when we look for its original meaning is the principle that was intended to be applied, and if that principle is broad enough to apply to school desegregation, as it clearly was, then that was an appropriate application for it and Brown was undoubtedly correctly decided.

That is true. 

I can think of no reason to disagree with it. 

Well, there is no question about the correctness of the proposition, that the more significant the interest, the greater societal counterweight would be required to justify an interference or an abridgement of that interest.I think the question which this kind of a debate raises is whether it is useful to identify three places on the spectrum as a convenient basis for classification, and those who want to retain, as it were, the whole spectrum approach I think are saying to us in so many words, you are applying instruments that are too blunt when you try to identify just three points and say everything has to fit into one or the other of these three slots.I will confess that I have not come to the point, even though I have worried sometimes about whether we were articulating the middle-tier test as well as could be done, and maybe we are, but even though I have worried about that sometimes, I have not gotten to the point of saying we ought to scrap the whole notion of three tiers and just take, in effect, every issue as an original balancing issue in the first instance.

Well, I am certainly satisfied that it would be too blunt a set of instruments, just to have one test at the bottom and one test, if you will, at the top.

Senator, I am very much aware, in answering or in approaching an answer to that question, about the great spectrum of evidence that gets grouped under the umbrella of legislative history. It seems to me that the one general rule—and it is a truism to state it, but the one general rule that I can state is, when we look to legislative history in cases where the text is unclear, we at least have got to look to reliable legislative history.When we are looking to legislative history on an issue of statutory construction, what we are doing is gathering evidence, and the object of gathering evidence for statutory interpretation is ultimately not in any way different from the object of gathering evidence of extraneous fact in a courtroom.We are trying to establish some kind of standard of reliability, in this case to know exactly what was intended. And what we want to know is, to the extent we can find it out, is whether, aside from the terms of the statute itself, there really is a reliable guide to an institutional intent, not just a spectrum of subjective intent. I suppose a vague statute can get voted on by five different Senators for five different reasons, so that if we are going to look to pure subjectivity, we are going to be in trouble.What we are looking for is an intent which can be attributed to the institution itself, and, therefore, what we are looking for is some index of intended meaning, perhaps signaled by adoption or by, at the very least, an informed acquiescence that we can genuinely point to and say this represents not merely the statement of one committee member or committee staffer or one person on the floor, but in fact to an institution or to a sufficiently large enough number of the members of that institution, so that we can say they probably really do stand as surrogates for all those who voted for it.

Yes, indeed. 

Yes, sir. 

Well, there is a kind of, I suppose, broad principle of coherence that we look to. The fact is we so frequently speak of interpreting sections of statutes. What we are really obligated to is to interpret whole statutes. We should not be interpreting a statutory section, without looking at the entire statute that we are interpreting. One of the things that I have found—and I do not know particularly why I learned it, but I found one thing on the New Hampshire Supreme Court which has stood me in pretty good stead, andthat is when I get a statutory interpretation issue in front of me, I read the brief, I listen to the argument. But if I am going to write that opinion, I sit down, I tell my law clerks to sit down, but I do it myself before I am done, and I just sit there and I read the whole statute. Fortunately, I do not have to construe the Internal Revenue Code, in which case I would be in serious trouble with that methodology. But within reason, I try to read the whole statute, and I am amazed at the number of times when I do that, I will find a clear clue in some other section that nobody has bothered to cite to me in a brief.We are trying to come up with statutory coherence, not with just a bunch of pinpoints in individual sections. So, the first thing to do, in a very practical way, is to read the whole statute.It is beyond the intent of your question, of course, to get into constitutional issues, but we do know it is accepted statutory interpretation that if we have a choice between two possible meanings, one of which raises a serious constitutional issue and one of which does not, it is responsible to take the latter, and, of course, we looked at that.

Well, I was going to say activism is a term that we all employ to describe the activities of any judge when we do not approve of the activities. And so given that definition of activism

YOU are probably a more principled man than I am.

I think probably a fair bedrock of activism is at least—or example of bedrock activism is ignoring any clear and positive source, objective source of law. I think what you are de-scribing in your example is a refusal to accept an objective source of meaning.

Senator, I think that is one of those questions that you cannot answer in the abstract like that. If we are talking about a 5-to-4 decision that is 50 years old and has spawned a body of consistent, supporting precedent which is basically the foundation of the law that we have, the fact that it was 5 to 4 originally is a matter of small or no consequence at all.If, on the other hand, we are talking about a 5-to-4 decision which was rendered the year before and in between there are arguably inconsistent precedents with it, then, of course, you are not going to be able to give it that much weight. I suppose the real significance of its being 5 to 4 under those circumstances is that if it were unanimous it is virtually unlikely that there would be the arguably inconsistent precedents following it.So I just think the numbers analysis standing by itself is a misleading analysis.

I would be wary of any abstract numerical principle like that.

Well, Senator, it better not play any role in the application of principle. We all know of decisions—there could not be a better one than Brown.

By being conscious, Senator, of the fact that you could be influenced. It is a problem like any other problem; you solve it by facing it. You face the fact that you are human and that you are subject to being pushed unless you guard against it, and you face that as a possibility. You keep it in your consciousness. And by doing that, I think you can come as close as a human being134 can possibly do to eliminating that from a role in the decision which you otherwise might not even be aware it was playing.

Senator, I have not—as you know, I have not been a part of the Federal judiciary long enough to have any qualification to give a judgment about the problems of the federal system. I have virtually just arrived as a circuit judge when I suddenly find myself here.But I know that I have gotten used to thinking about that problem in the State context from which I came. I never wrote a definitive analysis of it, but I think I have some appreciation of the complexity of it.We tend, it is true, as lawyers and judges to be willing to stab ourselves to a degree, at least when we are really being candid, with some responsibility for the problem. We say, well, there are all of those lawyers out there bringing the cases, and the judges may say, well, there are all of those judges recognizing new causes of action that did not exist 10 and 20 and 50 years ago.I am wary of putting very much weight to those explanations. There are, of course, instances in which liability has been expanded. Products liability has obviously grown as a preferred cause of action.But what we overlook are two other things that have happened in the last 25 or 50 years. The first is, at least in my own State, we have got an enormously larger population. The litigation explosion in New Hampshire is, to a very significant degree, in civil matters, of course, a function of population.One thing the State of New Hampshire, I know, has not done or tried to do seriously until recently is to try to keep up with that population explosion. The fact is the population has grown far more exponentially than rights of action have grown during that period.

Well, Senator, I think what you allude to with respect to civil litigation is what might be called the good news of the litigation explosion, and that is that it is forcing not just the judiciary, it is forcing society to ask seriously in a way that it did not do 20 years ago, whether there is now a new significant class of cases which belong not just in regulatory agencies to get them out of the courts, but belong outside the adversary process entirely.I mean, the good news is that alternate dispute resolution has become a respectable subject of concern. It is a subject of experimentation in my own State, and I would assume in every State in the Union.

I certainly do. 

I will take that under advisement, Senator. 

Good morning, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you, sir. 

I will claim the privilege on that, Senator. [Laughter.] 

Good morning, Senator.(137)

They make me very nervous. 

I think he was referring, although most obviously to the nature of the appellate process, I think he was referring to the constraints upon the legal process which applied to it in any level, whether it be trial or appellate.What the judicial process gives in return for the respect and the acceptance that it deserves is an assurance of objectivity, to the extent that it is humanly possible. We confront that assurance the first moment we go into a trial court. We are immediately constrained. We immediately constrain ourselves in the search for facts to make that a search for truth. The reason we have rules of evidence in trial courts is to try to bring a discipline of objectivity to what we do and what we ask the other components of the judicial system to do in arriving at a result which can be called just.When judges function at the appellate level, if they are following the ideals of Cardozo, they are also subjecting themselves to thosekinds of constraints. There is no area, certainly, in which that constraint is any more focused and any more difficult to keep in perspective than when we are dealing with what have been called the majestic generalities of the Constitution, when we are searching for meaning which is not spelled out in easy black-letter phrases, when we are trying to construe statutes and constitutions which are not written with the detail of the Internal Revenue Code.What we are trying to do to avoid that roving quality, that knight errancy that Justice Cardozo—or Judge Cardozo then—was speaking about, is to try to find an objective source of meaning which constrains us, as well as the rest of the republic, which was intended by the people who drafted and the people who adopted the constitutions and the statutes that we are dealing with, because it is only if we try to search for a source of meaning outside ourselves and our preferences or the preferences that may be fleeting at the moment do we really deserve, as members of a judicial system, the respect and the acceptance which ultimately is the foundation for the rule of law in this republic or in any republic.

Yes. I share the demand that we look outside ourselves, the demand that we guard against simply imposing our views of morality or public policy, however passionately we may hold them and however profound our principle may be. We have not been placed upon courts, in effect, to impose our will. We have been placed upon courts to impose the will that lies behind the meaning of those who framed and by their adoption intended to impose the law and the constitutional law of this country upon us all.

He has got to guard constantly against substituting his values for the values which he is sworn to uphold.

Well, perhaps the only amendment I would like to make to the way you asked the question is I wouldn't single out the Federal judges. The Federal judges are confronted with a problem that confronts all judges. I have spent the last 7 years of my life as an appellate judge in the state system, so I know what I speak of from the State standpoint. That is going back to perhaps my earliest exchange yesterday with the chairman of this committee in which we began the discussion about one particular unenumerated right which is enforceable through the due process clause.As I indicated to him, I think that a fair reading of the Constitution of the United States, like a fair reading of the constitution of my own State, compels the conclusion that there were values, in the case of our discussion a value of privacy, which were intended to be protected even though they were not spelled out in blackletter detail. And the difficulty that the judges have facing that fact—if, indeed, like me they accept it as a fact—is the difficulty of finding a discipline process for giving content to what we call the unenumerated—or the category of unenumerated rights.This has been a source of great difficulty over the years. I think at one point yesterday in our discussion I mentioned my view that the incorporation doctrine is not the answer to the problem of how we keep from roving aimlessly in this quest. It seems clear to me that the concept of liberty is not limited by the specific subjects which the incorporation doctrine by bringing, as it were, the entire corpus of the stated Bill of Rights into the concept of the liberty clause. Liberty is not so limited.Facing this problem, judges have tried formulations, at least to give labels, if nothing else, to the enterprise that they are engaged in when they are searching for meaning and trying to put reasonable limits upon their search. One of those formulations was that the content of the liberty clause certainly includes whatever would be comprehended by the concept of ordered liberty without which liberty and justice would be impossible.I think perhaps I have preferred an approach which I indicated without a lot of discussion yesterday to the chairman, and that was the approach which is often identified—not exclusively but identified with Justice Harlan. Justice Harlan not only sometimes invoked the concept of ordered liberty, as, in fact, I think he did in Griswold. But he asked us to make a search somewhat further afield than that, but quite specifically to the subject of the American tradition, and search for evidence of that understanding of what might be called a bedrock concept of liberty, which is explained and indicated and illustrated by the history and traditions of the American people in dealing with the subject of liberty.I think my best approach to the problem of how to keep from a totally undisciplined and totally nonobjective approach to the search for meaning is very much like what Justice Harlan described. But this is a difficulty which the judges simply cannot avoid. If they accept the view that I espouse that a search for meaning and for content of the notion of liberty is necessary, then they have got to face this problem. And if they face it in the way that I do, they have got to look for some kind of objective limita-tions that will guarantee that they don't fall into merely personal expressions of preference.

I think there is no question that one of the animations in the judicial quest for self-restraint is exactly the consideration that you have described.

I certainly share the spirit in which President Lincoln made that remark. I think that what we have to recognize in assessing the significance of Lincoln's statement for today is some of the history that has passed in the time between when the President made that address and the time when we are living now.The most obvious and significant fact of history for our purposes is the adoption of the 14th amendment. The President was not contemplating the 14th amendment at the time that he made that statement, and he was not contemplating—he could not possibly have been contemplating the increase in national power in relation to the power of the States, which it was the object of the 14th amendment to effect. And that was in an increase in national power not only on the part of the judiciary but, of course, on the part of the Congress, too, as was indicated in some of our discussion yesterday about the significance of congressional enforcement power under section 5 of the 14th amendment. But it is undeniable that the very fact that standards for scrutinizing State action were enacted by the 14th amendment, and made subject to judicial overview is undeniable; that the Federal judiciary and, in fact, the State judiciary acting pursuant to the 14th amendment, assumed a power which President Lincoln could not possibly have envisioned at that time.We not only have to accept President Lincoln's admonition; we also have to accept the responsibilities that the 14th amendment have inevitably placed upon us.142 

Well, as you know, Senator, without any lecture from me, the constitutional precedent is always, in theory, subject to reexamination. Our theory of precedent tries to give some indication of the force which a given precedent should have when reexamination is requested. 

I think the proper way to approach that is that courts must accept their own responsibility for making a just society. One of the things that is almost a factor or a law of nature, as well as a law of constitutional growth, is that if there is, in fact, a profound social problem if the Constitution speaks to that, and if the other branches of the Government do not deal with it, ultimately, it does and must land before the bench of the judiciary. One of the interesting developments—and I would suggest to you without trying to indicate to you in any way the direction that I think it should go—one of the hopeful developments or the developments that give me hope is the fact that we are living at a point of history right now where there is so much concern expressed in this committee yesterday and expressed in comment throughout the legal and political community in the legitimate extent of congressional power to act under the fifth section of the 14th amendment. Because if, in fact, the Congress will face the responsibility that goes with its 14th amendment power, then by definition, there is, to that extent, not going to be a kind of vacuum of responsibility created, in which the courts are going to be forced to take on problems which sometimes, in the first instance, might better be addressed by the political branches of the Government. I guess the law of nature I am referring to is simply the law of nature and political responsibility, constitutional responsibility, abhor a vacuum. I have spoken to this point before and I think I alluded to it yesterday. 

The Supreme Court should only act and can only act when it has the judicial responsibility under the 14th amendment or any other section of the Constitution. But the Supreme Court is left to act alone when the political branches do not act beforehand. We had Brown v. Board of Education as a decision of the Supreme Court, because we had no decision from any other branch ofthe Government, at any other level of the Government, facing the undoubted constitutional problem that had to be solved.It seems to me that one of the changes we are seeing in the complex of power in this country right now is a greater willingness of the Congress of the United States to look to its authority under the 14th amendment, and for that matter, under article I, so that the Court is not left in the position of seeming to be the only guarantor of some of the very liberties that we must most be concerned with.

I think what he was getting at there, yes, I think what he was getting at is if we simply focused on one interest and the desirability of that interest alone, there is a tendency to selfdevelopment that is simply unchecked. That is why, as I said a moment ago, it is important, in my view, to approach the problem much as Justice Harlan did.But in any event, whether by the Harlan approach or by any other, it is essential for us—as judges, who have got to declare in some objective way the extent of the interest that can be recognized—it is essential for us to have some idea of the criterion that we are going to employ to find values which are not simply reflections of our own feelings at the moment and our own feelings about the desirability of the claims that may be pressed before us.

I think the key to the response to that, Senator, is in one of the terms that you used, when an unelected judiciary creates these rights. There is a sense in which the judiciary, I suppose, particularly at the State level and dealing with common law issues, do create rights. They are dealing in areas which, by definition, the legislature has left to the courts to develop.But when we reach the level that I think you are talking, and I know that you are referring to this morning, it is essential to observe the distinctions between the creation of rights, which implies that the Court is simply sitting there and coming up with notionsof what it thinks may be desirable, and the recognition, on the other hand, of rights which are implicit in the text of the Constitution, itself, in which it is the responsibility of the judiciary to find and to state in ways that we can understand. The difference between the creation of rights and the recognition of rights is the difference between unbridled personal preference, that knight errancy that Cardozo was speaking of, and a disciplined approach to constitutional meaning, on the other hand.I think when the people who are, like us, subject to the decisions that ultimately appellate courts must make, have a sense that the courts are conscientiously engaged in a search for meaning, that their task is to decide what should be recognized and not what is created, that that will make and can make all the difference in the acceptance which is given to the decisions when they come down, even if they are not the most popular.

Well, it is not a healthy development for a couple of reasons. The first is that some of the issues that seem most intractable may well yield to political solutions and the kind of political judgments which—and I use politics with kind of a large "P", I guess there—that after all, it is the genius of the democratic system to entrust to elected representatives.In the longer run, there is an even more disturbing tendency, and that is to the extent that there tends to be a vacuum of response to problems that have to be solved and to the extent that, of necessity, those problems ultimately end up before the judiciary and without having had some solution proposed by the political branch of the Government, or branches of the Government, there is a tendency, I think, on the part of all of us, and on the part of the people of this republic who elect, who appoint and who watch what is going on, to assume that the only guardians of the Constitution are the judges.The judges have a particular pivotal responsibility in guarding the Constitution, but it is absolutely essential to remember that the judges are not the only people in our governmental structure who are sworn to uphold the Constitution and to try to make it work.The Executive, the President of the United States, takes such an oath. All of you take such an oath. And you are, just as all of you in the political branches, are just as much responsible for making good on the Constitution's guarantees as we are in the judiciary.For the people of this Nation to forget that that is your responsibility, as well as the responsibility of people in my branch, is a very disturbing prospect to me.

Thank you, sir. 

Thank you, sir. 

I accept that as a personal principle. I recognize that it is a principle which is subject to much ferment at the moment, in trying to delimit its contours. I recognize that there is a school of thought which has received articulation within the present Supreme Court that the establishment clause was restricted to a more limited purpose, that it was restricted to the purpose of avoiding the literal establishment of a State religion, and was restricted to avoiding the expression of preference as between sects, which I guess in an historical context would, of course, be Christian sects or denominations.Whether, in fact, that school of thought is going to be pressed, as it were, as a claim for adoption, for a rethinking of the theory of the establishment clause, I do not know. I think we can reasonably anticipate that it will, and I think that particular position is probably going to be pressed before the Court. And I think the only thing that I could say to you with respect to that or with respect to someone who is pressing that issue before the Court is that, if I am there on any issue, I will listen respectfully to it.

I certainly accept it as the prevailing law of the United States, as it has been, for practical purposes, during my professional legal lifetime, and I do not have at this time either an agenda or a personal desire to bring about a reexamination of that position.The great difficulty that has come, as you know, in establishment clause cases has come from the difficulty of applying the three-part Lemon v. Kurtzman test, and the concerns that have been raised about that, naturally, provoke a search not only perhaps for a different test of the standard which we think we are applying today, but a deeper reexamination about the very concept behind the establishment clause.148 But if I were to go to the Court, I would not go to the Court with a personal agenda to foster that, and neither would I go in ignorance of the difficulty which has arisen in the administration of Kurtzman. The only thing I was going to add is, in the oft-noted conclusion that we can find circumstances in which there seems to be an opposition between the theory of the establishment clause and the theory of the free exercise clause, and we have to recognize that as a problem for the Court to deal with. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I was not involved in the drafting of the proclamation that was litigated in that case. One of the facts which I think may not appear of record, I frankly do not remember whether it does or not, is that following the original proclamation which led to the action that you refer to, the Governor revised the proclamation and he revised it to give it, to articulate a much more secular purpose to what he was doing than the first proclamation could perhaps have been read to indicate. When the litigation arose in that case, the position taken by the U.S. district court was that the second proclamation, what I will call the more secular proclamation of which I was aware, could not be considered in determining the validity of the Governor's action, without his making a formal withdrawal of the first proclamation by essentially the same formalities or with the same degree of publicity with which he had issued the first one. So, as a result, the second comparatively secular proclamation was never a pointed issue in the district court's order. I go into this, only because—although I do not remember the specifics of anything that was in that second proclamation. I remember well enough that there was discussion with the Governor about the fact that he was going to issue one and I probably saw the language of it before he issued it, although I do not specifically remember that. 

My recollection is that the revision took place after the district court action had been brought, but before the district court order was issued, because, as I recall the district court order, it included a determination that the district court should not take the second proclamation into consideration, unless the first had been withdrawn with the same formalities with which it had been issued.

Let me, if I may, divide my answer to that question in two, Senator.

I was going to say, you may revise it back, but let me start, if I may, with this: I think I have to respond to two different senses of that question. The first is how could I, as counsel for the State of New Hampshire, take a position in defense; second, how would I, if I were a judge with the identical issue before me today, tend to view it? And if I may, I would like to respond to you with those two distinctions in mind.As to the first question, my responsibility as counsel there was my responsibility as counsel in any case in which I was representing the State, speaking through the Governor, and that is was there a position which could be advanced on behalf of the position that he had taken, consistently with the law as it existed or as it might reasonably be argued that it ought to be, which was not a frivolous or wholly unreasonable position.I believe there was and took such a position. Essentially, the arguments which the lawyers in my office made were that although there were, of course, references to Jesus Christ as a religious figure. The tenor of the proclamation was to call into mind a set of moral principles which transcended the Christian religion.The reasonableness or the ethical appropriateness of taking this position I think is indicated by the responses which the various courts made to the action. In fact, the U.S. district court, through Judge Skinner from Boston, held against the State on that issue.The two extraordinary points which I think should be noted, in response to your question, is, first: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, to which the State took an immediate appeal, in fact, I forget the precise order, but it either reversed or stayed the district court's order, and the reason, as I recall, that it did so was that the first circuit thought the issue was such a serious issue, not a simple and clear-cut thing, that the plaintiffs, in fact, had come into court with dilatory hands, and that an issue of that importance should not be decided under the gun, because it was not an easy issue to decide.And what most concerned the court of appeals, as I recall, was the fact that the Governor had done exactly the same thing on Good Friday a year before. There had been plenty of time to litigate the constitutionality of what the Governor had done, and the plaintiffs, who were aware of what had happened the year before and likely to happen again, had not done so.39-454—91 6150 So, I took and take today the position of the court of appeals as a vindication of the one point which is most significant for my role, and that is did I have a reasonable position to advocate in that case. What is also interesting is that, although on what perhaps was the fastest appellate action I ever knew of in practice, although the U.S. Supreme Court later reversed the court of appeals, with the effect of reinstating the district court order, the U.S. Supreme Court did so on the basis of 5 to 4, so there was real division in the U.S. Supreme Court as to whether the court of appeals had acted properly on the basis of finding that there really was a serious issue here, and this was not some clear-cut constitutional violation. 

Well, that is what Judge Skinner had found, and at the point at which the Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals and reinstated Judge Skinner's order, it was really too late to do anything about issuing new proclamations, and the case just petered out at that point. 

If I were sitting as a judge today, I would probably have ruled, given that proclamation, the same way that Judge Skinner ruled. 

They certainly were to me at the time. 

The point at which it is clear that it is an unconstitutional action and that there is nothing that can be reasonably brought before the Court for adjudication. There is a great difference between the kinds of judgments which an attorney general must make when he is asked for an opinion as to what, in his judgment, is the most appropriate and most likely constitutional action, on the one hand; and when he is asked to ful-151 fill his role as State's counsel when the elected representatives of the people have taken a different position.The Governor was, in fact, elected by the people of New Hampshire and he had a role in setting State policy which was undeniable. If his view of what was constitutional differed from mine, but was subject to a fair argument in its favor, whether I would have ultimately made the same decision or not, I believe that I had an obligation to represent that position.I think what is most important to me about that is that it is an obligation not simply because as an attorney general I was hired on as a lawyer. Part of the attorney general s and part, indeed, of any lawyer's obligation to defend the Constitution is to engage in good faith and with the utmost vigor in the process by which we hope will be sound constitutional adjudication comes about.We will not have sound constitutional adjudication in this country if we do not have a sound and vigorous adversary system. Whether or not in any given case, I might agree personally that my client's judgment was the best judgment, whether I might agree with the ultimate conclusion as to whether it was right or wrong, my own personal belief is that, as a lawyer, I will do my best fairly and honestly as an advocate.We have a constitutional system in this country in which we are going to get the right result. I took that position as attorney general, and I have taken that position when, in fact, in an indirect way I was being sued myself. There was a case recently that was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court about the residence requirement for membership in the New Hampshire bar. That was a requirement that was set long before I was on the court, although I had not taken any step to change it and I thought there was a reasonable basis for it.But I can remember—after the argument was made in that case, before the Supreme Court, in which the constitutionality of a rule of my own court was in issue—I said to the lawyer who had argued the case against us that I didn't know how it was going to come out. I thought there was, in fact, good reason in the court's disciplinary responsibilities to require some kind of a residence requirement.But, in point of fact, the only thing I was really worried about in the long run was whether the issue had been vigorously presented to the Supreme Court. I said to him that I knew counsel representing us had done so and that I knew that he had done so, and I wasn't going to worry about the result.That same attitude that we have a valid process which is going to get us through if everyone in that process does the best possible, I think, should be part of the constitutional animation of an attorney general.

That is right. 

There is no question about its correctness. There was no question about its correctness at the time of Maynard v. Wooley. The first amendment would be worthless if that were not true. The issue—and I don't want to go into any more detail than you do, Senator—the issue in Maynard v. Wooley was whether requiring the display of a license plate with that motto was, in effect, requiring the person driving the car to appear to adopt or to affirm the truth or the soundness of the statement on the motto. I did not, in fact, believe that it was reasonable to construe a license plate requirement in that way. In fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court had already ruled on exactly that issue, and it held that it was not, for first amendment purposes, that kind of an affirmation that would be violative of the first amendment. The issue in Maynard v. Wooley essentially came down to an issue of interpreting fact. The Supreme Court of the United States, although not unanimously, disagreed. My best recollection is that I think it was Justice Blackmun and Justice Rehnquist who happened to dissent in that case. 

Was it 8 to 1? I may be wrong on that. In any event, the Supreme Court of the United States had already ruled— not against the Maynards, it was in another case—but they had already ruled on exactly that issue.153 So that I was not left simply to make a judgment on my own about what would be an appropriate case to defend, because that issue, in effect, had already been foreclosed to me by the New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling. So we might disagree about the application of the principle in that case, but the soundness of the principle is beyond dispute and it was beyond dispute then. 

I am sorry? 

Well, of course, as I think as you suggest the need to identify a motto on the plate, as opposed to identifying numbers and letters by which the car can be identified is, of course, not a particularly compelling interest, and it was not so regarded by the Court at the time. 

That is right, no, they just wanted that motto out. 

I think you have. 

Thank you, sir. 

Let me start with your first question on the establishment clause and the appropriateness of preserving Justice Black's adoption and the Court's adoption of the Jeffersonian view of a wall of separation. The difficulty, I think, that is focused by the Court today comes to the fore because of the difficulty in applying the—as I mentioned a moment ago—the Lemon v. Kurtzman test. But for that difficulty, there is some question in my mind as to whether there would be the present ferment to rethink the very conceptual foundation of the establishment clause, which, as you indicated a moment ago, Chief Justice Rehnquist has been doing in some of his own opinions. I think, like a lot of people approaching the establishment clause, I am loath to talk about scrapping Lemon v. Kurtzman, without knowing what comes next. With respect to Chief Justice Rehnquist's position, I have never done personal research on the issue of the original meaning on the establishment clause, as I said a moment ago to someone else. I would receive evidence on the issue respectfully, if there were reason to present it before me, but it is not something upon which I can pass a judgment at this point.155 What I think I can helpfully say is the difficulty which I think those who do, indeed, adopt the Jeffersonian view, must face on the Lemon v. Kurtzman test. In fact, it is a difficulty which has ultimately nothing to do with the final conceptual rethinking that may go on, on establishment, if, indeed, it does go on. As you know, Lemon v. Kurtzman has sometimes seemingly been honored in the breech. In the first Kresh case, as I recall, the author of the Lemon v. Kurtzman opinion said, well, that is a general approach that we have to this issue, but it is not the exclusive approach that we have to it. The discomfort—I suppose there are many reasons that have been expressed for the discomfort with Lemon v. Kurtzman—but I will tell you what my discomfort is. It is a discomfort which relates to the relationship between Lemon v. Kurtzman as an establishment clause test, and the so-called Shurbert test which has, in a series of cases, as you know, prior to the Smith case this year, been used as the test for free exercise. The concern is this, that in the free exercise cases—and I think I would like to take the Amish school case as my favorite example— in the free exercise cases, individuals are claiming that a generally applicable State law unduly burdens their exercise of religion. Once it is determined that, in fact, their position is a genuinely religious position and that there is, as a matter of fact, a burden placed upon it by a generally applicable State law, the Court has traditionally, since the time of the Shurbert case, applied a standard, as you say, of very strict scrutiny. There must be a compelling State interest to justify that burden, and the law that does so must be narrowly tailored to have that effect alone. It was on that reasoning that, in the Amish school case, Wise v. Yoder the Amish parents were allowed an exemption, in effect, from the requirement that they send their children to school until they are 16 years old. The great difficulty that arises is that, when we ask the question, what would have happened in the Amish school case, if, instead of coming to the Court as a free exercise case, it had come to the Court with a slightly different statute as an establishment clause case, what if there had been a statute in effect which provided that there would be an exception expressly for Amish parents, from the State law? The immediate problem that would have been encountered under Lemon, is that the purpose of that law, the first of the Lemon tests would have been a religious purpose. The speculation is just inevitable that the Amish school case could have gone the other way. Therefore, my concern is, since I have not personally had any reasons to raise questions about the appropriateness of the strict scrutiny test, and have no reasons to raise questions about the appropriateness of the strict scrutiny test for free exercise cases, have we not got to take Lemon to some degree of refinement which has not yet been articulated to avoid what has explicitly been recognized as the potential conflict between the two tests in which 

As I started to say and apparently got sidetracked on saying, I have had and have today no reason personally, in either research or philosophy, to want to reexamine the view which was expressed in Everson. But my concern is that that view has been identified with a Lemon v. Kurtzman test. And we have to face the fact that in the implementation of that view, there is a difficulty which sooner or later the Court has to resolve.

On the free exercise question, I have to be circumspect to a point because I believe that the Smith case is subject to a motion for rehearing presently before the Court. And without any question, I think the development of that issue is something that if I were confirmed would come before me. But I think there are some things that with a reasonable degree of specificity I can say.The first is that I do not come here and prior to the decision of that case or after it I have not had personal reason to want to reexamine the strict scrutiny test which has been applied in a lot of cases since Shurbert. I recognize the reasoning of the majority opinion. I mean I can follow it; I understand what the Court was saying in the Smith case. But I also recognize I think the fact that that case could also have been examined under the Shurbert standard. And as you mentioned or indicated a moment ago, that, of course, is exactly what Justice O'Connor did in her concurring opinion in that case.I do not know at this point whether we should take the Smith opinion, if it stands, as being a total rejection of Shurbert. The one thing I do know is that the way the opinion was written, Shurbert seems to have been reduced to a rule for unemployment compensation cases. And I can tell you that I did not so read it, and I did not so read its application to, let's say, the Yoder case, the Amish school case, as resting upon the kind of analysis which the Court indicated would be its only justification for applying it there.

May I just add one thing, Senator? That is, I would not want you or anyone else to take what I said this morning as a commitment if I were on the Court to join with Justice O'Connor if this matter were brought before me. What I do wantyou to understand is that I approach the issue, or would approach the issue, if it came before me, with exactly the view of the value of the strict scrutiny test which I described to you.

I understand that. 

I had no objection to his doing that, I assure you. 

Well, Senator, I think the only answer that can be given to that is that that is an issue which was never focused by the action of the United States and the Korean war because the issue was one essentially of congressional versus executive power, and that issue was never raised. The Congress of the United States, in fact, did fund the Korean war. The fact is that there was never a declaration, as you know, with the international law consequences that would follow from it. But the issue of constitutionality, as I understand it, is essentially an issue of congressional versus executive power in this area, and that issue was never raised.

I think that question, Senator, basically is a question about the constitutionality of the War Powers Act, is it not?

My concern is that I don't think 

Well, Senator, the reason that I was concerned to suggest that I think that raises the issue of the War Powers Act is not because there was any such resolution on the books at the time of the Korean war, but because the War Powers Resolution which is on the books today basically articulates a congressional position. And the congressional position would today be the focus for asking that question. I think two things are necessary for me to say. The first is, of course—and I know you recognize this—that because of the reasonable likelihood that the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution could come before the Court in some guise, I cannot give an opinion on the constitutionality of that. 

And I think the most that I can say with respect to looking beyond that specific issue is that it is recognized, though it is not a matter of litigation at this point, that the President as Commander in Chief is not limited in the commitment of the U.S. troops to a formal declaration of war. In fact, the War Powers Resolution itself recognizes that the President is obligated to take action and must have the power to take action. Therefore, it seems to me that the commitment of the United States troops in Korea in the first instance certainly could not be regarded, leaving aside the aegis of the United Nations, could not be regarded as itself an unconstitutional act. The only issue which it seems to me can be focused upon is: Is there an articulable way of limiting the President's authority as Commander in Chief which would focus this issue? And the only articulated attempt to do so that I am aware of has been the War Powers Resolution. I think, therefore, the only thing that I can properly say to you is we know—and it would, indeed, be my opinion—that the President is not certainly forbidden to commit United States troops without a prior declaration of war. How far he may go, in fact, I think can only be regarded today as a War Powers Resolution question. I will, in any event, be candid to say that I could not sit here today, even if we had no War Powers Resolution, and articulate to you a limitation on how far the President could go with or without the express approval of Congress. 

May I just add one thing, Senator? 

It seems to me that in approaching that kind of question, we really have to approach it in much the same way that we would approach a foreign relations question. One of the things that I think is standard analysis in the approach to questions of that sort is that when the President, in fact, is acting under the auspices of the foreign relations power and when he is, in fact, acting also with some expressed authorization by Congress, the issue of authority is probably an issue which does not arise or which is not focused. And I do think that in approaching the Korean war question, we have to face the fact that it was undoubtedly within the power to commit troops to some degree and some instance without congressional approval; that, in fact, congressional support was expressed throughout that period by congressional appropriation and by the authorization which Congress thereby expressed. And it is difficult for me to see—although I will rethink this when I have some time to be quiet, it is difficult for me to see how the combination of the President's power with that degree of approval and support from Congress could raise a genuine issue of unconstitutionality that would be subject to adjudication. 

Yes. 

Well, I think the only thing I could say to that is you make the assumption that Congress never has a funding option. Not being a Member of Congress, I can't second-guess you on that, but that is a position—it never has an option once the troops are committed and engaged. That is an assumption that I would be loath to make. 

There is no chance of it.

Senator, you can pack a lot into one question. 

Let me start first with an issue of adjectives because I think it is an important issue. You have characterized my testimony about the recognizable liberty interest as taking a very broad position, and you have spoken of my reference to incorporation as just a starting point. I want to go back to them for a moment just by way of preface.What I said in response to the question about incorporation was that I did not believe that the definition of the concept of liberty, which was subject to recognition and protection in the 14th and the 5th amendments, could be limited by the incorporation doctrine. Indeed, if it could be limited by the incorporation doctrine, there would be no question as to whether some core right of privacy was cognizable under those two amendments.With respect to how much further the so-called liberty concepts in those amendments should be treated as recognizing rights enforceable against the Government, I have not given an opinion. I have given an opinion that there is certainly a core concept of privacy which is to be recognized and that certainly aspects of marital privacy, which we discussed yesterday, are among them.How much further, how much broader the concept to privacy and, hence, ultimately how much broader the enforcement power under the liberty clause may be is something which is going to have to be developed by the courts over the course of probably a great many years.Going next to what you question is the inconsistency between my position in Dionne and my espousal of the correctness of the Brown decision, let me start by saying that, as you recognize, the interpretive position that I start with when I am looking at a provision which has not been construed is one of original meaning, and in discussion yesterday I distinguished that from the theory that would confine that meaning to those applications which were originally and specifically intended by the framers or by the adopters of that provision to be its application.I have read Raul Berger's book, and I think—although people will dispute about his constitutional interpretive views—I think his history is well accepted by most people today.There certainly was no intent whatsoever in the enactment of the 14th amendment to bring about school desegregation. And if in fact the meaning or the guarantee of equal protection were confined to specific intent, then of course, Brown, instead of being a correct decision, would have been a wrong decision. But my interpretive position is not one that original intent is controlling, but that original meaning is controlling.In construing the 14th amendment, the first fact that has to be faced is that the best index, the point at which you start the quest for meaning, is with the text. And as I said yesterday, the text of the 14th amendment is a very broad text. It is not in fact, as we well know by its terms, limited to race, although race was obviously the problem most on their minds. It was not limited as the 15th was by reference to prior condition of servitude. And therefore whatever troubles some people may have with the 14th amendment, I think the point at which we have to start in the process of construing the scope of the equal protection clause has got to take into account that it was not written in such a way as to be restricted either to race or to the specific racial applications intended or on the minds of the people when it was adopted.And given that as a starting place, as I said, I think there is no question that Brown was correctly decided and the provision correctly construed.Now, is that inconsistent with my view on Dionne? It is not. Just as I said a moment ago, the text is the starting place from which we have to construe the 14th amendment; the text was the starting place from which we had to construe the provision of the New Hampshire Constitution that justice should be available freely and that right or justice should not be purchased.The question is how much freedom, if you will, from cost was that provision intended to embody. If we read that provision in a totally, literally, expansive sense, we could have said, well, certainly there can be no filing fee for someone who wants to come into court in a civil case. In a sense, there is nothing free if you have to pay $50 to file your case. And we could have gone on through a number of incidents of expense that are accepted in the system and have always been accepted in the system as being costs that could reasonably be levied.The question before the court was, then, how free did they intend it to be; what kinds of costs were they trying to outlaw? And that, in the context of that particular issue, came down to basically a choice between two principles—the principle against paying anything beyond a filing fee to get into court, on the one hand, saying that anything beyond that would be a violation of the provision; and the other principle, which was the one that I thought was supported by evidence of the original meaning of the framers, that what was trying to be outlawed by that provision was essentially, in a word, bribery. I think the provision was traced back to the kind of fines which the medieval courts dealt with and which were still in people's minds at the time of the adoption, whereby money payments could be made to the courts either to delay a case or to bring about its resolution at the convenience and with the result intended by a given litigant.And therefore the issue in the Dionne case was simply a narrower issue than the issue in Brown v. Board. The meaning came down to a closer choice between two possibilities. But the ultimate criterion of meaning for me in the Dionne case was exactly what I think the ultimate criterion should have been and was for the Supreme Court of the United States in Brown—not specific intent, but the principle intended. And of course, those distinctions will grow narrower and narrower the more narrow and exact the language it is that we are construing, but the ultimate criterion remains the same.

In the Dionne case, sir? 

NO, it was not. The only issue that was raised there was the provision precluding the purchase—or, the requirement that justice be purchased.163 

We do have such a rule. I think the only times that we ever depart from them are times in which it would be so misleading to decide a case based on an issue which on our examination we later realized was there and cannot be avoided, that we might be forced to refer to it, although even there the preferred practice, of course, is to call for a reargument so that that can be expressly addressed. 

Well, I can see the basis for making the verbal argument although, of course, you can't have a purchase without a sale. So I did not find when I looked really any basis upon which I thought I could really justify a distinction there. And as I think you know from the Dionne case, I would not have been unhappy to find that kind of a distinction because I thought the practice involved there was a bad one. 

Yes, I have. 

I guess my greatest crusade was the cause against bringing casino gambling into the State of New Hampshire, which I thought would destroy the political fabric of the State. I did not believe that we could maintain—in a State with the resources that we had, I did not believe that we had a very good chance of maintaining the integrity of the law enforcement structure of the State when the economy would have been so totally overbalanced by the amount of money that would have come in for that purpose. And I devoted a considerable period of my time one year as attorney general to that crusade, if you will. It was not entirely popular in some circles. It was an issue upon which the Governor, who had appointed me, and I broke. I am glad it turned out the way it did, and I enjoyed the crusade. 

Well, my interest there, Senator, has been perhaps less a research interest than an interest in local administration that brings health care to people. As I said yesterday, it all started when I was asked to serve on the board of a hospital, and it is one of those interests which sort of took off by increments, and Iended up finding it virtually a second job for a period of about 5 years in my life. But the focus was not a focus on academic research so much as it was a focus upon the kind of administration that gets health care to people and determines the cost that they are going to have to pay for it.

Not a public crusader, no. There are some causes to which I have contributed, but causes in which I have come out as a public crusader I think have been limited to those.One of the things, I can tell you that the inhibitions on crusading when you are occupying the position of attorney general or of judge, of course, are there, as I think you know as well as I do. The number of organizations that a judge finds himself slowly resigning from in order to avoid recusal problems can sometimes be one of the tragedies and in any case one of the prices that we pay for being on the bench. And I have been through that experience, as you know.

Well, 12 years, actually; I was 7 on the supreme court

Well, Senator, the first thing that I would have to say is that I wouldn't give any final opinion on what should be done with those demonstrators without hearing them; and the only place that I heard them was in the back of the room. I haven't heard them in a courtroom. I am happy that I haven't heard them in the back of the room again, and I probably will never see them in a courtroom, and I wouldn't make any final judgment about what ought to be done without doing that.What I think I can usefully do is give you a sense of the significant contrast between what went on here and what went on in the case that I was dealing with when I did have to take a position and did take a number of positions as attorney general of the State.The first thing you mentioned was the fact that I opposed their release on personal recognizance bail. That is correct. That position was taken on the night that the demonstrators were arrested following the second day of the demonstration.Now, the arrest occurred because the demonstrators at that time, or the remnant of them—I think there had been about 3,500 or 4,000 there that day, and as it turned out there were about 1,400 left who refused sort of the last and final request to get out before arrests started. At the time the arrests took place, those demonstrators were occupying the parking lot that was used on a working day by the work force that was building the nuclear power plant, and they refused to leave it. One of the reasons that the State police made the decision to arrest—a decision which I was aware of and certainly took no exception to—was that they knew, this being late on a Sunday afternoon, that at 7 on Monday morning the work force was going to arrive in that parking lot, and they knew that if that happened they had an extremely combustible mixture, and what had been in fact a demonstration of civil disobedience was not likely to remain one if that happened.When, therefore, they were arrested and arraigned at special sittings of the local district courts to determine what the bail should be, the question which confronted the State was: If personal recognizance is granted, what will be the effect of that? And, in fact, the demonstrators had indicated, as I recall it, quite publicly within the armories where they had been brought, that as soon as they were released on personal recognizance they were going to regroup and go back to the parking lot and presumably be there the next morning when the workers arrived.Therefore, I made a judgment that personal recognizance was, in fact, simply going to render the action of removing of no use, and the next morning we were going to have trouble on our hands. I therefore decided that the appropriate requirement would be some cash bail, conditioned upon good behavior and showing up for court on time. I therefore recommended that cash bail of $100—probably cash or bond, but that $100 be requested.As I think you know, that very issue was later litigated in a section 1983 action that was brought against a number of State offi-166 cials, including me, and the U.S. district court concluded that that was perfectly reasonable bail, that there was not any indication that the people involved could not make it or that it was unreasonable.I think it is safe to say—well, maybe I shouldn't say, but I think it is safe to say that we do not need or would not need, probably, in the aftermath of yesterday's incident, that particular kind of prudential concern.The second thing you mentioned was my opposition to suspended sentences and a request for hard labor. I don t know. The first part of that is true, and the second is not, except in a very technical legal sense. I did oppose purely suspended sentences because, as a practical matter, they would not be sentences at all, and I thought they would have no deterrent effect. And I think they would not have had.I think I may safely say, although there is no record of the court in question that I am aware of, that never in the course of my recommendation did I make any reference to hard labor. The only reference to hard labor that occurs in connection with these cases occurs—or at least it did then—in the New Hampshire statutes. The New Hampshire statutes refer to any incarceration, any incarceration following conviction, whether it be in a house of correction or the State prison, as being at hard labor. I know that in some county houses of correction, of course, as you know, there are work details just as there are in the prisons. But for practical purposes, there is only a very attenuated sense of labor today.I was not interested in hard labor, and I don't believe I ever used the term. In point of fact, a substantial number—I don't know whether I could say most, but a substantial number of those demonstrators never, in fact, even saw the inside of a house of correction because most of them—because they refused to make bail— spent their 15 days in the National Guard armories where they had been taken awaiting trial. And at the end of that time, as I recall, I ordered them ejected because I didn't think they should be staying in the house of correction longer than they would have stayed if they had gotten the sentence that I had recommended. So, to the best of my knowledge, there was no labor involved in any aftermath.With respect to the crime commission, I was a member of the Governor's Commission on Crime and Delinquency at that time. I couldn't possibly tell you what the category of money was that might have been available as Federal help for unusual law enforcement expense. But, apparently, there was some such category of it, and because this was a very expensive proposition for the State, I urged and argued very strongly that the crime commission ought to approve an application for it. I couldn't tell you at this point whatever happened to the application. I don't know whether the State got a grant to help defray expense or not.

Well, I—excuse me. I reread one of the newspapers that I had not looked at for 14 years, and I think I found thepassage that you referred to. There was one member of the commission at that time who claimed that I had—I forget whether he used the word "threats" or "extortion" or whatnot as an inducement to the members to vote for it. And I remember in the latter part of that newspaper article the reporter said that he or she could not find anyone else who was in the crime commission at that time who would support that particular view.I think it is fair to say on the record that that was an eccentric interpretation of what I had said, although there is no question that I had argued very strongly that the commission ought to support the request for the grant. And I have no doubt whatsoever that I indicated that the Governor felt very strongly that the commission ought to do so. It was standard practice to bring such opinions before the commission.The next issue about seeking contributions to defray expense is, again, luckily once which I trust no one will have to face in response to what happened yesterday around here. My understanding of the sequence of what happened on that is this: The demonstrations took place on the last day of April and the first day of May back in 1977. According to my own records—and I think this is also indicated in one of the discovery affidavits that I filed with the U.S. district court—by the 3rd of May, I had formulated a position on what the State should request in the trial of these cases, which, as I said, was the 15 days and a fine of $200, the fine to be suspended on good behavior.My appearance before the court that you referred to took place on the 5th of May, which was the middle or the latter part of that week. As I understand it, on the 6th of May, 3 days after I had formulated the State's position and 2 days or 1 day after I had appeared publicly in court to state it—on the 5th of May, the Governor issued sort of a request to the Nation to make contributions to help defray the expense. He sort of went out publicly and passed the hat.I have no recollection of discussing with the Governor the funding that this was going to cost except for the fact that there was money available in an appropriation known as the emergency fund, which was under the control of the Governor and council. And there was also at that time—and I think it was during that same week—a meeting of the finance committee of the New Hampshire Senate before whom a request for an emergency appropriation had been made to be appended to a pending bill. And I do recall discussing with him my appearance before the Senate. I did appear before the Senate. Some people were relatively happy to vote money and some were not, but that was the extent of my fundraising activity.I know—rather, I have been reminded in the last couple of weeks as material has been assembled on this—that subsequent to that, the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, who was the principal owner at that time of the nuclear powerplant, made a contribution to the State of New Hampshire of around $70,000, in round figures. That came, according to the records that I have gotten, late in June. I think it was June 30. At least, that is the date on which I have a record of State action to accept the funds.168 If there was any particular appeal to the Public Service Co., it was something that had nothing to do with me or my office. The one thing I do know about it beyond the date is that the amount was determined as the amount necessary to offset the extra law enforcement pay expenses for the weekend of the demonstration. And so far as I know, discussions about any contribution from the Public Service Co. took place between the department of safety, which includes the State police, and the company. In any event, it was the department of safety that made the accounting for funds, and it did not involve me or my office. The last thing you mentioned would similarly be happily unnecessary and inappropriate in the kind of disturbance we had yesterday morning, and that was police dogs and fire hoses. I was sort of unhappy to hear about the police dogs and fire hoses because I had spent a fair amount of my energy in the week or so prior to this big demonstration indicating that I was not going to use police dogs and fire hoses, and that I wasn't particularly happy to be facing the demonstration, but that a matter of civil disobedience did not call for police dogs and fire hoses. I think in the course of that senate hearing in which the expenses that was being accrued was not the most popular political subject in the State at the time, one of the senators—in fact, I think it was the senator from my own district—said instead of wasting all this money and putting them through the criminal justice system and convicting and sentencing them, he said, "Why didn't you just drive them away with police dogs and fire hoses?' My recollection is that I said that was, if appropriate, it was only appropriate in a riot situation in which there was no other way to control it. And I said that is not what we had. So I seem to have gotten metamorphosed from an anti-police dog and fire hose man into a pro-police dog and fire hose man. And I would kind of like to go back to the prior position and leave that as mine on the record. 

Yes, sir, I will. That letter actually came back to my attention within, I think, the first week of my nomination, so it was one of the earliest pieces of prior history that I reread. That letter was written by me in my capacity, I think at the time, as chairman of what was known as the legislation committee of the superior court. The superior court did not take, and very scrupulously avoided taking, positions on general social issues—or even law enforcement issues, for that matter—except insofar as they would impinge on the capacity of the court to do its job. To the extent that there was going to be an expansion of jurisdiction without an expansion of judges to handle the business, we would bring that to the attention of the legislature, for example.On this particular issue, the appropriateness of using a superior court judge as the deciding authority for permitting or refusing an abortion upon a juvenile when parental consent was not available, the court felt very strongly on two grounds that it was an inappropriate position to place the judiciary in. Those grounds were expressed in the letter.There were some judges who, for reasons of their own moral scruples, would not under any circumstances authorize an abortion as, in effect, a surrogate for parents. There was another group of judges who believed very strongly, not because they opposed abortion personally but because they believed that it was inappropriate for a judge to make what was in their view an unavoidably moral decision for another person, that they should not engage in that kind of an exercise of jurisdiction.The upshot of these two views was that if the bill was passed, it was a virtual certainty that a significant portion of the superior court bench—which at that time I think in the State was probably around 18 judges—would find itself, for one or the other of those reasons, unable to discharge the function that would have devolved upon them. And I think, as I said in that letter, the court's view was that this is necessarily going to lead to judge-shopping. No minor or no person on behalf of a minor would want to appear in front of a judge whose moral views were known to be opposed to abortion. And at the very least, the result was going to be that a very small number of judges were, in fact, going to find themselves exercising the entire court's jurisdiction in these matters.It was for that reason that the court, as I recall, unanimously believed that it would be inappropriate for the judges to be given that job. I think I was chairman of the committee at that time, and I drafted a letter to that effect. But that is representative of the limits on lobbying that the judges do. It was lobbying only to the extent of bringing to the attention of the legislature matters which they would not know, but which we as judges felt they had to know if they were going to make intelligent decisions.Now, you are quite right to recall to my mind the fact that the issue did arise later on when I was on the supreme court. And one of the members of the legislature came to me at that time and said, well, will you sort of reauthorize this letter as a statement of the judicial position. And I said that I could not do so for two reasons.170 The first is it was the position of the superior court, and I was no longer on the superior court. The second and equally strong one was that if the legislature did not, in fact, take the advice—if that is what the superior court still wanted done, and the legislature did not take the advice—it was virtually inevitable that there would be issues brought before the New Hampshire Supreme Court involving matters of constitutionality, involving claims that judges, in fact, could not avoid this kind of responsibility. And it seemed to me necessary that I not become involved in the kind of legislation that might lead to that sort of an issue, and that I be very careful not to allow the name of the supreme court to be associated with it.My own guess is that if there literally had been an action brought before the supreme court, it probably would have been in a posture in which I would have felt it necessary to recuse myself. But it still would have been the case that there would have been a supreme court justice taking a position. And so, quite apart from the fact that it was not an issue for the supreme court, there was a very strong reason to keep the supreme court at a distance from the resolution of the issue in case eventually there was litigation about it.

Yes, I think, in fact, that is the kind of concept which is recognized and which is reflected in the theory of limited governmental power and which is at the focus of our search for an appropriate meaning to the scope of liberty protections.

I mean, as you suggest, that power can only come from the people, yes.

Well, we know that some of those inherent rights, of course, are reflected in the specific provisions of the Bill of Rights, and I have also said in the course of my testimony today that it is one of the objects, as we now analyze these problems, is one of the objects of the liberty clause, both in the State constitution and in the National Constitution, to define and protect this point beyond which government simply cannot go or cannot go without the most strong justification.

That is a fundamental purpose and, as you know from just the structure of the constitution in our own State, that was the purpose which the drafters and the Founders saw fit to express before they had even addressed the question about the appropriate structure of government.

Well, we know, Senator, subject to the Constitution, that there traditionally certainly have been circumstances. The example of the death penalty, as you know, is recognized right in the Constitution

Well, are you asking this as a question of constitutional law, now, not a moral, not a personal moral issue?

I can certainly conceive of circumstances in which it would be arguably justifiable to take another's life, even though mine personally was not threatened. There is the object of war, the example of war, the example of protecting one's family. You would protect your child, even though your life was not threatened.

I think probably I and everyone in this room would accept the proposition, the general proposition that life, of course, morally should not be taken without justification. Where we would find our points of difficulty might come in either defining the concept of life or defining the very concept of justification that arguably would be brought up in argument.

Those were the millions that I could have been earning, if I

The extent of recognition in the cases of mental or emotional health is something that I am not clear on the legal development on, but certainly there is recognition of the possibility of abortion to save the life of the mother or to save serious injury to her health. 

Yes, we recognize that, and, of course, those issues have been raised in the funding cases, too. 

I think I have, but I voted for the resolution, and my recollection is that the specific terms of the resolution allowed abortion consistent with was then the new legal era inaugurated in the terms of Roe v. Wade. My recollection—and this is simply something I am not clear of, after this time, but I think there had previously been probably a hospital or staff bylaw referring specifically to the preexisting New Hampshire statutes 

That abortions could be performed within the hospital, and my recollection also is that the resolution was explicit in saying that this did not obligate a given hospital employee or medical staff member to do anything against conscience. 

Well, the change in policy was to allow doctors who chose to perform abortions as a medical procedure in that hospital, to do so consistently with Roe v. Wade. The resolution was not—and I do not think this was the point of your question, but the resolution was not intended to make the performance of abortions a hospital function, as opposed to a function of the medical staff which practiced independently within that hospital. The reason the hospital took that position and the reason I voted for it was that Concord Hospital was a community hospital, it was not tied to any sectarian affiliation, it served people of all religious and moral beliefs, its medical staff represented all religious and moral beliefs, and so did the patients who went through the hospital. We did not believe that it was appropriate for us, whatever might be the moral views of a given trustee, to impose those views upon the hospital, when in fact it was the law of the United States that a given procedure was lawful. It was, of course, a further justification, and I cannot tell you offhand how much weight that justification played in the minds of any one trustee, but it, of course, was a serious one, and that was, given the fact that the hospital would be available for abortions, if a doctor chose to perform one there. One of the functions which the hospital was giving to the community was the function of the greatest degree of safety in medical care, and if abortions are going to be performed as, by law, they could be performed, it was appropriate in a nonsectarian hospitalto allow the full range of backup services for the safety of the mother and, indeed, for the safety of all participants, and we felt— and I do now feel—the hospital had an obligation to do that.

I did not. 

My vote has no such implication. My judgment with respect to the appropriateness of the procedure in a hospital of which I was a trustee is no more a reflection of a personal moral view of mine, pro or con, than would be any judgment that I was required to make as a judge of a court.

I will leave the questions to you, Senator. 

I am not aware of what you may be getting at or anything that I could respond to your question.

I think there is no question, 14th amendment liberty includes liberty in that situation.

AS you know, it raises very great difficulties. 

There is no question, that liberty 

There is no question, that liberty interests extend to every living human being. In answering that, of course, as I am sure you do not intend, I am not giving opinions about the validity of living wills and things of that sort. But the appropriateness of the 14th amendment is an invocation of right and is open to everyone. 

Without being more specific about the legal context, Senator, I don't know that I would see any point in drawing that kind of a distinction. I portend nothing by that answer, but I just think that is the kind of statement that one really cannot make without being misleading, unless one makes it in a very specific context. 

I think that was in 1964 or 1965. 

Without invading the privacy which they have a right to expect, I think the only thing, Senator, that I can tell you is that I counseled them against taking the kind of, in fact, dangerous action which one of them had described to me they had in mind. 

Well, it wasn't something that I spent much of my youth watching, but I have heard the term. [Laughter.] 

I still have a black and white TV. 

They were right about me on that one, I'll tell you. 

Even network television. 

Of course, I would start just where you start, Senator. You have a responsibility to inquire into competence. You have a responsibility to inquire into personal integrity, a responsibility, certainly, to inquire into basic knowledge of the Constitution and its values. Then there is, as is frequently spoken of in connection with the ABA's inquiry, there is an inquiry into judicial temperament.

Well, the danger inherent, I suppose, is that the judiciary can devolve into an institution for the expression of purely personal values. The institution itself is one step removed from the democratic process. Fortunately, that is only one step because the democratic process is going on in this room. ButSenator K ^'DHREY. Yes, it is. Permit me again to interrupt. It is a mighty big one step removed. This is our one opportunity. You are going to be over there for decades, for good, I hope and trust and believe. But it is not a small step removed; it is a huge step removed.Judge SOUTER. Because of that step, as you point out or indicate, subject to impeachment, there is no recall. There is no secondguessing.I would not be true to my own sense of constitutional principle if I did not say that the Senate ought to be looking for someone who, in seeking the very difficult or in going through the very difficult process sometimes of seeking constitutional meaning, would seek for something outside that judge's personal views for that moment, who would seek to infuse into the Constitution a sense of enduring value, not of ephemeral value, and who would try to rest that process on as objective an inquiry as can be possible, given the great breadth that is necessary when we do search for value, for these massive generalities and magnificent generalities that are committed to us.But I could not end an answer to that without saying that with the best will in the world to avoid the changing and the ephemeral and the purely personal, a judge in the long run is going to go wrong unless that judge is willing to listen.The fact is we learn much from what goes on in courtrooms. I think some people tend to look upon—people perhaps who have not been through the judicial process, I think they tend to look at it with suspicion as to whether what goes on in courtrooms, including appellate courtrooms, is really capable of changing judges' minds178 or influencing the way they think or forcing them to refine their views.One of the things I know from personal experience is that the process works. I mentioned yesterday that although I didn't come down with any statistics, I have kept track of my own performance listening to oral arguments and reading briefs. And I can think of instances, some specific and some in general, when my mind has been changed by what I heard and by what I read and by what I thought after an argument. Ultimately, you cannot choose, you must not choose, a judge who is not open to that kind of influence.

There is no question that there have been times when I have been concerned about the wisdom of individual court decisions. I was in law enforcement once, and there were times when I used to chafe over the difficulty that law enforcement had in conforming to some of the Warren court decisions.One of the things I am glad of is that that is an era which has, in large measure, passed. We do not have the same problems that we had 20 years ago. There are some who would say there is a greater pragmatic appreciation on the Supreme Court. You know, there is also a much greater degree of practical pragmatism in the entities who come before the Court. We have learned to live with much in the last 20 years, and we have lived with it reasonably well.I am not standing here, leaving aside my position as the nominee, fearful of one trend or another. I could be critical about individual decisions. There are decisions which we will undoubtedly discuss in the course of the next afternoon or the next day or two, some of which I would have come out differently on. Any lawyer and any judge can say that. But I don't have an alarm to raise with you at this moment.

NO apology is needed, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you, Senator. [Recess.] 

Yes. I think to begin with it is an appalling fact. I happen to have a friend who is on the bench who described exactly the same experience to me growing up in Manchester, NH. He was Jewish. He didn't leave the room every morning, but he was cut apart from the rest of his class when the Christian Lord's Prayer was recited.The fact is the Supreme Court today I think has carried the law to the point where a period of time for silence which may be used for any meditative or non-meditative purpose that a child may want has not been declared to be a violation of Lemon v. Kurtzman. But I think it is probably equally clear that the use of prayer which has, as you describe it so graphically, the kind of exclusionary effect is by virtue of that very evidence a kind of use of prayer which, under the Lemon test, would have presumptive religious purpose and presumptive religious effect. As I understand Lemon v. Kurtzman, that would certainly violate it.It also calls to mind the alternative formulations which in some of the recent cases Justice O'Connor has been referring to, and she has been adverting to exactly the phenomenon that you have described. She has been saying what we should be looking for is whether the practice in question and its effect on people has the kind of effect of telling them that you are somehow outside the legitimate scope of our real community. She is looking for that kind of sometimes subtle and sometimes very gross exclusionary effect.

On that particular afternoon, the immediate problem before me, as I recall, probably did not take me that far. I had a very immediate problem in front of me that afternoon, and I think we probably confined the philosophy to the immediate181 danger. But that was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details.

No one could avoid recognizing the consequences of that statute for the options that were available. That was obvious to all of us.

Well, I used that not as an implicit exclusion of something else but as a subject matter that we have become familiar with. Our approaches to it, our judicial formulations of it have varied back and forth over the years. But going right back to the time of the often disputed cases of Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, the Court has confronted, whether precisely or imprecisely, the fact that there is a core set of family values which, in the general understanding and the traditional understanding of the American people, are protected. And so we, in fact, have had a great deal of time in this century to be thinking in those terms, and that is the most familiar focus for what we are talking about. But I do not mean that to be a focus which implicitly excludes other interests.As I said a moment ago, there is no question that the judiciary of the United States is going to be spending a significant amount of time in the years ahead trying to give attention to other claims— indeed, giving attention to other claims and trying to adjudicate.

Well, I think perhaps it is wrong to go back and say you have answered my question for me.

But you have there. We find, as you point out on the provisions against the quartering of troops, the provisions against unreasonable search and seizures, the provisions against compelled self-incrimination, which gets you out of a kind of physical context. There are, indeed, reflections of what we could in a general way describe as privacy interests there. And as it goes without saying, the great debate has been the extent to which a privacy interest not so specifically recognized must be assumed under the concept of liberty. I have taken the position, although I cannot say here what its extent may ultimately be determined to be or what I would find it to be, yes, there is a core that goes beyond those specific pinpoints.39-454—91-

I have not either, no. 

I think the only thing I can say in the abstract is I have to decide the cases that come to me. I would only ask you to look at those cases and see whether in your judgment they were decided fairly. I do not have a pro-labor or a pro-management agenda. I can say that this gets us somewhat outside the labor area, but I can't help but remember that in one of the early weeks or so following my nomination, there was an article—I think it was in the business section of the Sunday Times—on "Is this a friend of business?" And I remember one of the conclusions in there was that this is not a nominee who is out to rescue business from its bad decisions or from its improvidence. And I hope in any such weighing as you may believe it right to do, you would bear that in mind, too, because I think there is, indeed, a record on that point. 

I think that—I hope that was not the exact quote because I don't believe that. The kind of discrimination that I was talking about in that speech was discrimination, as I described it and as I recall being quoted in the paper about it, a discrimination in the sense that benefits were to be distributed according to some formula of racial distribution, having nothing to do with any remedial purpose but simply for the sake of reflecting a racial distribution. That is to be contrasted in two absolutely essential respects, from on the one hand affirmative action and on the other hand the kind of distributive remedy which it is appropriate for courts and, to a degree yet to be fully developed, appropriate for Congress to consider. I would suppose it would go without saying today that if we are in the United States to have the kind of society which I described yesterday as the society which I knew or found reflected in my home, there will be a need—and I am afraid for a longer time that we would like to say—a need for the affirmative action which seeks out qualified people who have been discouraged by generations of societal discrimination from taking their place in the mainstream183 and in all of America and in all the distribution of its benefits and its burdens. That is an obligation of individuals, and it is an obligation of government.I think it also goes without saying that when we consider the power of the judiciary to remedy discrimination which has been proven before the judiciary, the appropriate response is not simply to say stop doing it. The appropriate response, wherever it is possible, is to say undo it. That is a judicial obligation to make good on the 14th amendment.And as I said a moment ago, one of the developments in American constitutional law which is at the stage, I would say, of exploration now is the development about the particular power of Congress to address a general societal discrimination as opposed to a specific remedy for a specific discrimination. That is a concern which will be played out in constitutional litigation for some time ahead of us.

Identifiable class within a situation, yes. 

Yes. I think the difficulty that you have—and I mean you and I will have it here—in talking in the abstract is to say, well, how far do you go when you are imposed a judicial remedy. 

NO, I was just going to say how far you go to the point where you carry yourself across the line from a remedial order to an order which addresses a societal and not a remedial problem. And I don't know how you draw that line in the abstract, but you have to be conscious that you should not be either too shy or too bold in the use of the judicial power. 

That is right. I think no such abstract line can be recognized. There are going to be some cases in which the only thing that is going to be proven is going to be a specific act of discrimination. There are going to be other cases, in fact, in what is184 proven is, in fact, a far broader but proven discrimination. And the remedy must be tailored to the proof.

No, it leaves me with a feeling that we are on the verge of developing law, rather than in a situation in which we can say with clarity that the law has developed and we know what its limits are going to be. When we address the kind of issue that you raise, Senator, we immediately go back to the Fullilove case, in which the Court found that it did indeed pass muster under the congressional power to set-aside, I believe it was a 10-percent minority set-aside in that case. There is certainly one reading of the recent Metro Broadcasting case, in which the Court upheld a—I forget the precise articulation of it, but upheld the use of giving some extra credit to a minority application subject to the FCC, simply by virtue of its minority origin, and approved the use of restricting for sales in those cases to minority buyers. On the other side of the scale, we know that there is less flexibility available to the State and local governments to do that kind of tailoring to broader societal discrimination, and I think, without question, one of the most significant subjects which is going to be developed in the Court in the foreseeable future is a more precise definition of just what the congressional power is, whether it be under section 5 of the 14th amendment or under Congress' article I power. 

It was unprecedented, as you know, at the time it was passed. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, if it is all the same to you, I would rather take the questions and we will have lunch after. [Laughter.] 

I did not seek this job, as you know. I was asked by the President of the United States to do this. What I said to you yesterday afternoon is my answer to that question. If I am confirmed in this office, I will be given the greatest power that anyone in the judiciary of the United States can ever know, and that is, as I said, the power to preserve and to protect. With it, as with all power, goes a like degree of responsibility, and if I am confirmed in this office, I want to try the best that I can to exercise that responsibility, to give the Constitution a good life in the time that its interpretation will be entrusted to me, to preserve that life and to preserve it for the generations that will be sitting perhaps in this room after you and I are long gone from it.186 

Yes, sir. 

Yes, sir. 

I will be candid with you, Senator. That last part of the question, I would not be presumptuous enough to answer. We will have to wait and see. But I know how Justice Brennan is going to be remembered. It has nothing to do with Justice Brennan's philosophical position, it has nothing to do with any distinction that may or may not be drawn between him and me. I am not going to draw such a distinction. Justice Brennan is going to be remembered as one of the most fearlessly principled guardians of the American Constitution that it has ever had and ever will have. No one following Justice Brennan, absolutely no one could possibly say a word to put himself in the league with Justice Brennan. All you can do is to say what perhaps once Justice Brennan said, "I will do the best I can." 

Well, there are the 200-and-some-odd opinions which have represented a great deal of substantial writing to me, and I will not ask you to read all of those 220-odd opinions. 

That is right. No, in point of fact, I guess there have been two things that have motivated me. One, I describe I guess with caution, but in a fine kind of way they go to what Senator Simon was speaking of a moment ago. I have loved the judiciary. I have been a trial judge, I have been an appellate judge, and I want to be nothing else. As the years have gone, I have found that my judging has become more all-consuming of me than I once thought it was going to be. In earlier days, including the days when I was on the trial court and, in fact, before I went on the bench, when I was in public law practice, but still practicing law, one of the things that I wanted to do with my time was to do something other than as a lawyer, and that is why I served on boards and I had experiences, which Senator Simon was right in saying, that changed me. They made me grow. Beyond that, I will admit that there have been some times when I have been tempted to write on things that concern me professionally very much, and I was once even given almost a cart blanche for a book publication, if I would write something. I have not done it or I did not do it in those instances, because the things that I would have wanted to write about most were the things that were coming before me, as a judge, and, frankly, I was afraid that if Istarted writing too much, I was going to end up recusing myself too much, because, as I envisioned what I might have written, it would have been difficult to get into it without starting to take positions and do just what I should not have done.There are many judges who have handled the business of writing with great subtlety and they have managed to come up with extraordinary outputs, without compromising themselves in what they did on the bench.The thing in several instances that I would like to have written about I think probably would have either forced me into writing just generality, or into writing things that really would have started disqualifying me, and I chose not to do it.

Oh, I turned around. 

Yes. 

Actually, I had some practice for this. I remember that something very similar happened during one of Governor Sununu's inaugurations, and there was a sense of deja vu to the whole experience. No, I turned around. 

Only in the sense of doing things that I asked to have done. There have been some lawyers, as you know, from the White House Counsel's Office and the Justice Department who have been there to help me. But the ground rules were at the beginning—and they were, in fact, not ground rules that I even had to impose, I mean they were ground rules that were offered and they were the only appropriate ones—were that they would pull together material that I wanted to review. As you can imagine, I have been revisiting a lot of cases, some of which I have read almost on a daily basis certain times in my life and some of which I have not read for a long time. So, what was agreed upon at the beginning of the process was that we would work together on a suggested topic list. All nominees, obviously, are going to review certain subjects, so they had a topic list much in mind. We discussed it I think the first week of the nomination, and they then collected the kinds of material that I wanted to do my reading. There have not been the kinds of briefings in the sense of saying, "Judge, this is the law or this is an appropriate position that you ought to maintain the hearings." There has been a very scrupulous regard for the fact that I am the nominee, and not the administration.

That sounds like the right count, yes. 

Well, I 

I appreciate exactly the issue that you are raising and I think it is good to raise it. I suppose there is no question, that Congress could sort of create an office of legal adjunct to nominees to try to provide the help that we need, and we do need help. I mean I wanted to do a great deal of reading and rereading, as I said, in the time prior to these hearings. One of the things I know is that I could not very efficiently have spent my time alone pulling all the material together in a very usable way. I would have spent a good deal of time just running back and forth between stacks and libraries, so that at least a candidate or a nominee who wanted to approach the hearings as I did, would need some help. It might be difficult, given the pace of Supreme Court nominations, to make that a very workable proposition. I must say I tend to analogize as closely as I can the role of the people who have helped me in a way, to the people whom I am very used to having help me, and that is the law clerks that I have on the court. The role which the Justice Department and White House lawyers have played for me has, in fact, been a far less intellectually close one than the role that a judge and his law clerk plays. For example, one of the things that I want my law clerks to do is to argue me out of a position, if they think I am taking the wrong one. So there is a very intense kind of intellectual interchange that goes on or one hopes will go on between judge and clerk. Yet, when that clerkship is over, that does not—and I think is not thought by anybody—to taint the possibility that some day that clerk can appear before the judge in court. My own personal rule has been, although I never formalized it, that I would not hear a law clerk's argument for at least a year had gone, and so 

I see the point that you are making. I am glad to have the opportunity to say that nobody has been subtly or otherwise lobbying me on a particular position. 

There is no question, a nominee needs help. 

YOU are absolutely right and, fortunately, these people have given it to me. 

Yes. 

I frankly do not remember the early discussions on it. I mean everybody was arguing it. It was probably fodder for more argument among lawyers than any other case, certainly, of its time. The only thing I specifically remember is I can remember not only I, but others whom I knew, really switching back and forth playing devil's advocate on Roe v. Wade. 

Oh, I doubtless had an opinion. No, I did not just say "wow." 

Well, with respect, Senator, I am going to ask you to let me draw the line there, because I do not think I could get into opinions of 1973, without there being taken indications of opinions in 1976. 

I think it would be misleading to say that. I have not got any agenda on what should be done with Roe v. Wade, if that case were brought before me. I will listen to both sides of that case. I have not made up my mind and I do not go on the Court saying I must go one way or I must go another way. As you know, the issue that arises when an established and existing precedent is attacked is a very complex issue. It involves not only the correctness or the incorrectness by whatever lights we judge it of a given decision. It can also involve extremely significant issues of precedent. 

And I do not sit here before you, under oath, having any commitment in my mind as to what I would do if I were on that Court and that case were brought before me. 

Actually, I have never seen a camera in a Federal court. As you know, I have been a Federal judge for a comparatively short period of time and, as a result of what happened to me last July, my judicial experience on the Federal bench has been cut very short.The only experience that I have had were with cameras in the New Hampshire Supreme Court, where they are allowed, as long as they are not obtrusive. The experience there was that, after the rule was passed allowing the cameras in, for a period of time there was a spate of great interest in taking photographs in the courtroom, and, you know, any case that rose in interest to sort of 5 on a scale of 10 would carry with it video cameras in the back of the courtroom and so on. That lasted for about 2 years, and I am sorry to say that apparently the news media or the New Hampshire public at that point grew so bored with what they were seeing photographed, that people stopped taking pictures and we have not seen them for very long.I do not know whether, if this hearing went on for 2 years, the photographers would all clear out or not, but that was the New Hampshire experience.

Well, I am of two minds, in one respect. The fact is, if the cameras are unobtrusive and they are not making, you know, sound that is distracting, that is one thing. There is still a risk there, and I will get to it. Cameras which are obtrusive in the course of oral argument, so that they really do tend to distract your attention, I think is something that has got to be avoided. When I am sitting there on a bench, you now, I am very much in the position that the members of this committee are, except that I am in an even tougher one. Several of you have said to me, well, after you leave here, if the Senate confirms you, we will never see you again. You have at least got a few days' worth and you can decide how long it is going to be that you do see me. When I am sitting as a judge, I am seeing or I am hearing the sides of the case for 20 minutes or half an hour or whatever the case may be. It is a short period of time and I do not want distraction from that case. So, that is why a clicking camera can be difficult in a situation like that. [Laughter.] That seems to have provoked a great deal of clicking. [Laughter.] I think I need say no more. [Laughter.] 

There is no question that there is as value there. 

The big difference, you see, is you are rightly keeping me in the role of the lawyer and the advocate. The big difference is that, on those issues, we have got a lot of law today that we did not have then. Just take literacy, for example. At the time Attorney General Rudman and I were engaged in the literacy test case, Oregon v. Mitchell had not come down. Oregon v. Mitchell was decided, as I think I said yesterday, perhaps 4 months, 6 months after we argued that case. So, there were arguments which were there to be made then and they are not there to be made now. As I said earlier this morning, the virtue of the system and one of the very responsibilities of the lawyer, as advocate, is to fight out the constitutional issues in a sufficiently illuminating way, to give the courts the help that they need from the adversary process to sharpen those issues and get them right. So the fact is, I would not be making the same arguments today, but we would not be having the same cases today, either. 

I am content to have you end it there, sir. Thank you. [Laughter.]

Could I strike one word? 

YOU know which one. [Laughter.] Thank you, Senator.

Yes, sir. 

Thank you, sir. 

Mr. Chairman, I think there are two questions in your question. First, is the interest that the woman would assert following pregnancy a liberty interest? Second, having asserted that, what weight should be given to it? Should it be given the same constitutional weight as the liberty interest which she asserts prior to pregnancy? With respect to the first question, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I think that going back to an exchange you and I had yesterday, I think you alluded to that. There are the Supreme Court reports, including dissenting and concurring opinions, that are replete with references to the fact in just such contexts as this that liberty is not limited to locomotion. That is, that is exactly the sense that you have been explaining this afternoon. So, of course, it would be asserted as a liberty interest. The second question, how should that liberty interest be valued, is one of the central questions in the Roe v. Wade debate. And with respect to that, for reasons that I mentioned yesterday, I think that is the point at which I must respectfully draw the line. I wonder if I may ask you one thing, and if this is out of turn, you tell me. 

Well, in fact, that is one difference between my role here before this committee and my role as a judge. I can't ask questions here. 

Well, I just did. In any case, thank you. I remember when this first came up when you and I were speaking yesterday afternoon, and I said you understand my position. I thought afterwards I am not sure that everyone does. Would it be out of turn for me to take a minute for me to explain why I feel that I have to take that position? 

I promise you this is not a New Hampshire ruse. I say that because there are a number of people watching what we194 are doing today who have not heard an explanation from me, and I think they ought to have one.I have alluded to the reason a number of times. Ultimately it goes to the fact, as we did say yesterday, that the continuing validity of Roe v. Wade is an issue which will come before the Court, and if I shall be confirmed it will come before me.The reason it is inappropriate for someone in my position to express an opinion on an issue which would be comprehended by that request to overrule Roe v. Wade goes right to the heart of what the judicial process is.And if the judicial process is nothing else, it is a process in which in every court and on every issue that may come before a judge the people who come before him can have a fair hearing. A fair hearing means something substantially more than simply judicial courtesy to sit back and let a person say whatever is in that person's mind. A fair hearing requires a willingness of the court not only to listen, but genuinely to examine the position which the court is inclined at that point to take.Anything which substantially could inhibit the court's capacity to listen truly and to listen with as open a mind as it is humanly possible to have should be off-limits to a judge. Why this kind of discussion would take me down a road which I think it would be unethical for me to follow is something that perhaps I can suggest and I will close with this question.Is there anyone who has not, at some point, made up his mind on some subject and then later found reason to change or modify it? No one has failed to have that experience.No one has also failed to know that it is much easier to modify an opinion if one has not already stated it convincingly to someone else.With that in mind, can you imagine the pressure that would be on a judge who had stated an opinion, or seemed to have given a commitment in these circumstances to the Senate of the United States, and for all practical purposes, to the American people?You understand the compromise that that would place upon the judicial capacity and that is my reason for having to draw the line. I thank you for the time to say it.

The answer to that question is two-fold, I guess. We think about that process of weighing values in essentially the same way and essentially by the same principles that we go about weighing values in the liberty case with which you and I began,196 the circumstances prior to conception. We go about it in exactly the same way we go about assessing the value of any liberty interest.As I have explained, basically my approach to it is the approach of Mr. Justice Harlan. The point at which I think you and I respectfully have to part company is on this point. You are saying to me that I am not, if I were to answer your second question, I am not in any way saying how I would rule.With respect, I think I am a third to a half of the way down the road to saying how I would rule. Because as you say, there are a number of components in that ruling.

No, sir, it doesn't. But the road between here and Roe's house does not have 3 forks, it has 3 miles. It has

Pardon me? 

I don't think it is a forked road. I think we have to cross certain territories, if you will, of subject matter. We have to cross the issue of how the interest is itself valued. We have to cross the territory in which we explore what the countervailing interest may be and how they are to be valued. And in a case of reexamining a prior precedent we have to cross the territory of valuing that precedent in accordance with the general rules that we have. You are saying to me and I respect the position from which you say it, sir, that I want you to cover the first third of the journey because that still leaves two-thirds of the way and you may or may not travel those two-thirds if you are asked to do it. And my response has to be when I travel the first third, I am giving a third of an indication of what would be done, and with respect, I think I cannot do it. 

I will drop my analogy if you will. 

Because there is no serious possibility, I think, today that anyone would maintain before a court, in the history of equal protection development that we have had in this country, that the only two focuses of equal protection have got to be at the one end least scrutiny of all, at the other end greatest scrutiny of all, as in the scrutiny for fundamental rights. There may be disagreement within this committee, there may be disagreement within the court among lawyers as to how to articulate the way that we travel that distance between the least and the most scrutiny. But I think it is fair to say that there is no question today of anyone seriously arguing that there are not interests which are important enough to transcend the least scrutiny and which may not be important enough to get to the greatest. And my concern in the discussion, as you know, has been that the real tough question is whether the test for that place in between, if we are going to have discrete spots on the spectrum, should be the one that we have or a different test, if we could devise one. 

Sir, I have not chosen the articulation of the middle-tier standard. I am saying that that is the one we have got now, and we ought to see if we can do a better job in articulating it.

The position that I have taken—and I would have thought, and I do think that it would be unreasonable to take any other position—is that 

I have not taken a position that it is unreasonable. What I am saying is that it would be unreasonable to take the position that the interest in avoiding discrimination on grounds of sex is of such obvious unimportance that you could seriously argue at this point that it should be left to the minimum scrutiny. As to whether or not a sexual classification should be judged on the basis of the very highest scrutiny or not is a subject upon which I have not taken a position. I think the two things that I have said is clearly we must recognize that it is more important than minimum scrutiny. And if we are trying to devise a test for a middle tier, I am concerned, as I have said before, about the flexible quality of the one that we have. 

I don't think there is a reasonable debate. 

Well, it involves the same level of scrutiny if a classification 

I think what I told Senator Specter was, No. 1, that the test as you have just quoted me as saying was the Supreme Court's test for it. And I told Senator Specter that there was nothing in my experience which had led me to believe that I would wish to re-examine that.

I am saying that there is no basis that I would raise in the discussion with Senator Specter or anyone else on this committee to give them an indication that I think there should be a change in the test that the Court has had. I also said to Senator Specter, when we were describing, for example, the concept of establishment, that I had not done any research or taken any position on the question of re-examining the concept of establishment.

And I said to him then and I would now that if a case of that sort were brought and the argument were made, I would listen. But I do not approach those issues with any preconception that I 

I was going to say, at least you have gotten the chance to do that. You know, what I said yesterday, I just listen.

Yes, with this one caveat, which I think is unnecessary: You and I, we are both abbreviating Justice Harlan's language when we were speaking of that second approach to reasoning. But with that, yes, of course. 

I promise. 

I could not accept the view that, as a rule always to be applied, the most specific evidence is the only valid evidence, and I do not think that Justice Harlan would have done so, either.It is a quest for a greater degree of certainty that we understand, and it seems to me that the quest for the kind of evidence that we are after should be a quest not for evidence which, as a matter of definition or a matter of absolute necessity has either got to be of narrow compass or of general compass, rather, it has got to be a quest for reliable evidence, and there may be reliable evidence of great generality.The analogy that I thought of, as you were describing that, is far from a perfect analogy, but I think I will throw it out anyway. We do not say, when we are engaging in the normal evidentiary problems in the trial court, that we will accept only direct evidence and not circumstantial. We do not narrow down our kind of search for truth in ways like that, and I think

That is right. 

The answer is we cannot, as a matter of definition at the beginning of our inquiry, narrow the acceptable evidence to the most narrow evidence possible 

Thank you.

I hope you will have a persuasive effect on the Chairman, Senator Thurmond. 

Senator, yes, the answer is yes to that and I see your staff has been busy at lunch and I have had some help at lunch myself. I would be glad to supply you or the committee with some citations to things that I did not think of at that time. Let me just say, if I may, just a word about the Panto case, since you have mentioned it and I think Senator Simon probably would have interest in it: Panto is a case brought by a so-called at-will employee or on behalf of an at-will employee who had been given what is known as an employee's handbook, which supposedly set out the terms and conditions of employment. One of the terms and conditions that were described in that handbook was a right to deferred compensation upon the termination of his employment. The question in the Panto case was whether the employer could unilaterally simply revoke that particular condition, and one of the arguments made was that an at-will employee could be fired at any time, by definition, and, therefore, the conditions of employment can be changed at any time. The holding of the court in New Hampshire, which was unanimous in adopting the opinion that I wrote, was that, in giving that kind of a handbook, you are engaging in exactly the same kind of enterprise that you do when you make a unilateral contract, you are holding out a set of terms and saying if you will do something for me, these are the terms upon which you will be recompensed or will be rewarded. I have to say that I really did not think the reasoning in the case, including the analogy to the unilateral contract, was very remarkable, but I do know that in similar cases courts in other jurisdictions, particularly in times past, have gone the other way. So, it is true, it was—I would not have put it, if I had been classifying my cases, as a pro-labor case, but if you are going to draw that kind of distinction, I think that is the decidable line that it belongs on. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, the problem that has to be confronted in those cases is that when there is a combination of expressive conduct and speech in the most literal sense, the kind of conduct which is used for expressive purposes may be subject to reasonable and legitimate regulation by the government, in a way that mere words would not be. Therefore, what the courts have done is to try to come up with a test for evaluating the government's interest in the conduct, as opposed to the speech or the merely expressive part of it, and the test that has been devised consists of asking whether, in some way infringing on what would otherwise be an absolute freedom to engage in that expressive conduct, the government has a substantial and legitimate interest which is unrelated to the regulation of free expression, and, if so, whether the particular law which tends to restrict the right of expression there does so in a way which is narrowly tailored to serve that governmental interest and to infringe on the right of expression no more than is absolutely essential. It is a kind of line-drawing, when conduct is complex, some of it clearly subject to first amendment standards and some of it subject to regulation on grounds having nothing to do with speech. 

Senator, there are, I suppose, a great many things we could say, but there are two aspects of it which I think are foremost in our minds. The first is the appropriateness of judicial remedy. Sometimes activists have been criticized for seeming to look for causes, rather than cases. I do not know that there is much we can say, in general, about it, except what I said on the questionnaire which was filed with the committee, that the extent of a judge's obligation to provide remedies in a case in which some violation or infringement of right has been found is primarily and, in the first instance, a function of the case before him. It is a function of the extent of the violation that he has found. The second sense of activism which I think is probably in the back of everyone's minds is a sense that I have touched upon in earlier remarks before the committee, and that is a sense of the judge as embodying pure personal preferences and value choices, however sincerely they may be felt, as opposed to embodying values which are found and based upon some kind of an objective205 search for meaning, whether it be the meaning of Constitution and the meaning of statute.I think I have said more than once during the course of these hearings that my approach to the obligation of judging is to try to find an objective source of meaning that simply does not force the court into, in effect, giving free rein to its own predilections.

AS you know, Senator, the basis for the exclusionary rule, as it was explained in Mapp v. Ohio, the case that applied the exclusionary rule to the States, was to induce the police, to induce the executive branch of the government from engaging in activities which violated fourth amendment rights, and the theory was that if the police could not profit, if the prosecution could not profit by using evidence illegally seized, there would therefore be an inducement to avoid seizing evidence illegally, so that the object of the exclusionary rule as a means to enforce the values of the fourth amendment was a very pragmatic one. But the focus of that explanation was, of course, on police conduct.That point is reflected in the Leon case, as you have just described it, because what the Leon case is saying is that if the mistake which leads us to conclude that there has been a fourth amendment violation was a mistake not made by the police, but made by the judge or a magistrate who issued the warrant, that should not preclude the introduction of evidence on the theory described in Mapp v. Ohio. If the mistake is not the police's mistake, then you gain nothing in influencing police conduct by keeping the evidence out.The one overriding limitation which was placed, of course, on the Leon rule is that the mistake must not only have been a judicial mistake, but the kind of mistake which the police could nonetheless, as it were, in good-faith proceed without recognizing, and, therefore, I think the Leon rule is entirely consistent with the rationale for the exclusionary rule as described in Mapp.

Senator, there is a curious parallel between the explanation that I am going to give you now and the discussionthat we had just a second ago on the good-faith exception, because as the Court has explained it and as you know, the Teague and the Penry cases refer to the availability of what is known as collateral relief by writ of habeas corpus in the Federal courts for State prisoners.What that means in practical terms is that a State criminal defendant may well have been through the State criminal justice system by way of direct appeal or even collateral review in the State system, have taken his request for relief as far as the Supreme Court of the United States and have been denied discretionary review and still have an opportunity to raise constitutional claims by petitioning for a writ of habeas corpus in the Federal courts. And because the relief is sought by a new proceeding, we call it collateral, rather than a source of direct relief.Now, as the Supreme Court of the United States has explained the theory behind underlying Federal habeas corpus relief in situations like this, it in effect has said we recognize that not all constitutional errors may get corrected in the course of direct review in the State system, and collateral relief by writ of Federal habeas corpus is provided as an inducement to the State systems to do a good and sound and reliable job of constitutional adjudication, because if they do not, they know that the prisoner has another avenue of relief in the Federal system.Now, what the two cases that you describe have held, starting with Teague, what they have held is that if a prisoner is going to get relief on habeas corpus collaterally in the Federal system, with two minor exceptions—well, not minor, but two exceptions, that relief has got to be based on the law that was in existence at the time the State courts reviewed the conviction, and the reason for this is they are saying we provide this relief in order to induce reliability and good faith and constitutional adjudication by the State courts.That is a value which is not going to be served, if we also grant relief on the basis of law which was not in existence or had not been declared at the time the State courts did their review. In other words, I suppose in a very simplistic way, we cannot blame them for failing to follow some law which was not there for them to follow at the time. Therefore, under those cases, Federal habeas relief is restricted and is available only for violations of the law as it stood at the time.As I said, there are two exceptions to that for changes in the law which recognize conduct or penalty totally beyond the power of the courts to impose and for violations which go to the fundamental reliability of a conviction. But subject to those two exceptions, habeas relief is, therefore, limited and it is limited in a way which is consistent with its object.

Senator, we all work with the ideal that the kind of personal opinion which may be at variance with the law is not going to play a role in the judicial decision. When we get to an area like the imposition of the death penalty, we also I think have to recognize the limits on what is humanly and morally possible.I do not know whether there are any States, I presume there are none, in which the death penalty decision is one which is rendered in the discretion of the judge, and I presume that that is totally out of the question today. But even though a judge may not have the role of deciding that the death penalty may be imposed, the judge certainly may have great moral qualms, if the judge is morally opposed to the death penalty, in taking part in a proceeding which could have the result of an imposition which he believes is morally wrong.I think what judges have to recognize in those circumstances is perhaps there are cases in which their moral views are so strong that they simply cannot preside, and I think we have to recognize the moral compunctions that a judge would feel in those circumstances and we have to recognize a right to recuse if a judge feels that way.

Senator, as you know, one of the proposals that has gained attention and currency in some places has been referred to as the privatization of prisons, in effect, the contracting out of what traditionally has been regarded as a direct State function and State responsibility for imprisonment.I am not sure, in response to the question that you describe, that that really is an alternative, because if any one thing is clear, it is that so many of our prison overcrowding problems are functions of the amount of money that can be spent or is spent in prison construction and prison administration.There is no question that if prisons are not to be expanded, if alternative facilities are not to be found, and the rates and periods of incarcerations tend to rise, as in many places they are as a result of the activity in drug prosecution, then there may very well have to be value choices made by the States to change the possible penalties in other crimes, so that there will be room in the prisons for those thought by the legislature to have the first priority in the need for prison space.

Senator, I think the sentencing guidelines will create a greater confidence in the justice of the system. I would not take the position, I do not think anyone takes the position that sentences have got to be imposed absolutely, without judicial discretion.But I do think very strongly that the judicial discretion which is exercised in sentencing should be a very structured and disciplined discretion, otherwise the problem of disparity in sentencing is simply insoluble. Like countless other judges, I have sat on a court in which sentence is set to be rendered. One of the concerns that I and, I suppose, most other judges have is that, if Judge A gives a sentence twice as long as Judge B for the same offense, there has got to be a very strong and apparent reason for that disparity, without the belief that there is, in fact, injustice in the sentencing system.My concern about the effectiveness of this perception of injustice is not limited simply to the perception of the public. I think there should be an equal concern for the perception of the defendants who are sentenced. If there is going to be any hope for any rehabilitative effect in sentencing, particularly on young and early offenders, it seems to me it has got to rest upon a reasonable perception that the system in which the sentence has been imposed is itself a fair system.I applaud the efforts of the government to devise sentencing guidelines. As I think you may know, the chief judge of the court on which I now sit was one member of the commission that proposed the guidelines that we have.

My experience, Senator, has been entirely in the State system. As you know, I am a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit right now, but I have sat there hardly at all.I do have a very vivid recollection of the problem of white collar crime in the State. The problem there was not that penalties were insufficient in the sense of there being no penalties on the books which were adequate to the offense. But there was for a long time, certainly in the early years in which I was practicing law and engaged in the criminal justice system, an unspoken feeling that somehow the white collar criminal should at least get one freechance or the feeling that the white collar criminal, even when caught, should never in fact be sentenced to incarceration. This seemed to me was both morally unjust and socially indefensible.I can recall being, I think, part of the process within the courts by which a very different kind of look on white collar sentencing has been gradually taken effect, and suffice it to say, I do not take the position and have never taken the position that the white collar criminal should be dealt with in some way which is essentially different from any other brand of criminal.

Senator, we know, without much fear of argument on the point, that the basic conception of the Constitution, as it was proposed in 1787, was that of a government of limited powers. That very assumption was the reason why a Bill of Rights was not proposed, because the reasoning went that a government whose powers were as limited as these were not a threat to civil liberties and that civil liberties could be perfectly well guarded by the bills of right in the State constitutions.The position of the Federal Government, of course, has in some respects changed since 1787, and the biggest change has come about as a result of the enactment of the 14th amendment, which has given the government a power with respect to the subjects covered by the 14th amendment, which the constitutionalists of 1787 certainly never anticipated.So we know that there has been deliberate action by the country in the adoption of the 14th amendment which has had an effect on the constitutional theory of 1787, and the difficult issues that are going to face the courts probably in the next decade or two is to work out with a precision, which the courts have never done, just the extent of added power, particularly to the Congress of the United States, which was intended to be conveyed by section 5 of the 14th amendment.

Senator, we all fuss, and frequently fuss with reason, that the level of performance in the trial courts and the appellate courts is not what we wish it could be.There is not any ultimately generalization that is possible. I have heard splendid arguments in the Supreme Court of New Hampshire and I have heard some that were poor. I have seen lawyers who seem barely above the level of competence in the trial courts and I have seen others who seemed to be geniuses of trial law.I think you put your finger on one approach to the problem of trial competence, when at the end of your question you refer to the adequacy of the level of representation, and I think when you dothat, you make reference particularly to representation in the area of the criminal law.I alluded yesterday to the fact that, when I first started practicing law, every lawyer sort of took the cases that were assigned to him by people who needed representation without cost, and lawyers took on criminal representation under the same circumstances.One thing we found is that in criminal law, as in anything else, it helps to be an expert. And one of the things we have found—and I am sure this is true not only in New Hampshire, but throughout the Nation—is that the federally funded public defenders, usually federally funded or State funded public defenders, have provided a degree of expertness in criminal representation which it is virtually impossible to get, simply by drafting a lawyer in private practice who does not do criminal law, suddenly to take over the representation of a defendant.We have had exactly the same experience in looking at the criminal appellate work which is funded, whether by State or Federal dollars, as a result of which we have an expert criminal appellate bar which is the envy and the equal of the prosecution in the State. This kind of evening up of the level of representation has, in fact, brought about a quality of justice which was unknown when I got admitted to the bar.

Senator, I think it would be presumptuous of me to try to give a disquisition on the United States Supreme Court's caseload, which I, of course, have had no personal experience with.The one thing all of us outside the Court are aware of, although we are probably inadequately aware of, is the enormous pressure of that caseload, in the number of petitions for review and in the pressure on the Court to accept the maximum number of cases which may exhaust its limited time.As you know, in the course of the last term of the Supreme Court, the number of cases taken has been reduced somewhat, and that seems to me an appropriate thing for the Supreme Court to do.At the State level, we too have had caseload problems. One effect of that in my own State was, as a practical matter, to force the State Supreme Court to go to a system of discretionary review, deciding whether or not to take a given case for which an appeal is decided, as against the old system when I was younger, in which everybody had an appeal of right.One of the other effects of the growing caseload, as we said the other day, yesterday, was to foster ways of disposing of cases outside of the traditional adversary judicial system, sometimes under its auspices, sometimes on a purely private basis.I can tell you that the exploration of what everybody tends to group together under the title of alternate dispute resolution is, I think, an extremely hopeful sign. There is only one thing that I fear, and that is that, as State budgets continue to be squeezed and as money for the judicial system becomes harder and harder to find, in competition with the other claimants for limited State budgets, that there is going to continue to be such a squeeze, particularly in the civil area, where there are no mandatory constitutional standards or few mandatory standards for speedy trial, that in fact private civil litigants are going to get squeezed out of the judicial system, and as they get squeezed out of, simply because the system cannot handle their cases, they are, instead, going to resort, as they are already doing and are doing in my State, basically to private judging, in which parties will get together and they will hire somebody who may be called an arbitrator or may be called by some other title, in effect to decide their cases for them, entirely outside the judicial system, simply so that they can get the cases decided.If this trend continues, the great fear that I have is that we are going to be creating in the United States essentially two systems of justice, and the only people who are going to be using the civil justice system, if this is carried to extremes, are in fact the people who cannot go outside and spend money out of their pockets to hire a judge or someone in the private sector to adjudicate their cases.This seems to me an appalling prospect, not only appalling for the judicial system, but appalling for the Nation in the broader sense, that we are going to lose one of the institutions and one of the symbols that binds us together as a Nation, and that is a system of justice open to everyone, and that justice certainly has got to include civil as well as criminal justice.

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I am going to respectfully ask to decline to answer that question, for this reason, that whether I do or do not find it moral or immoral, will play absolutely no role in any decision which I make, if I am asked to make it, on the question of what weight should or legitimate may be given to the interest which is represented by the abortion decision.I think to answer that question and to get into a matter of personal morality of mine, when it would not affect my judgment, would go far to dispel the promise of impartiality in approaching this issue, if it comes before me.

It would be irrelevant to my decision, yes. 

Well, Senator 

Senator, there are two things here. The first goes to the Smith v. Coady concurring opinion that you referred to. That opinion did not rest upon any moral judgment of mine about the morality of the procedure. It represented a perception that those who may be engaged in counseling that could affect that procedure could find themselves, as the result of their moral positions, in an impossible bind if the Court did not allude to what their responsibility should be. That was an expression of my concern about their moral dilemma, not an expression of my moral position on the issue itself. The other distinction is that the other moral questions that you referred to are not implicated by any case that I see reasonably coming before the Court; whereas, the moral position on the abortion issue is, of course, clearly implicated by the request for Roe v. Wade reexamination because people on each side of the issue are impelled by very profoundly felt moral beliefs. 

With respect, sir, I do not believe I could do so without creating the impression that I could not give a fair hearing to people whose views might differ from mine on that. And I am not familiar with Justice O'Connor's answer on that subject. It may have depended upon prior opinions that she had given. What I do believe, Senator, is that for me in this forum to start in the most serious discussion, even with you, to an expression of213 my views of the morality on that subject would be taken by a substantial number of people as the beginning of a commitment on my part to go in one direction or another. You and I undoubtedly could agree that it should not be so interpreted, and it would not so portend my decision one way or the other.I do not believe it is realistic to expect that a substantial number of people listening to our discussion would share our views.

No; I 

Well, I am taking you at your word, Senator, that you believe it would not affect my judgment, and I know that you are taking me at my word that it would not affect my judgment. But I believe also 

I believe that there are a great many people who would not accept the view that you and I are willing to hold. And I don't believe that those people should be subjected to the kind of moral discussion which in their view would clearly compromise my objectivity. I think a great many of those people would say I am willing to accept his judgment that his own moral view will not influence his decision in the case. But if he then engages in a public moral disquisition on what that judgment is, it must be because there actually is some indication about what he would do in that discussion. And I do not think we should ask people, as it were, with a double standard, number one, to accept that the position is irrelevant, and yet at the same time to engage in a discussion of the subject which you and I agree is irrelevant. 

I can certainly indicate, as I hope anyone would, that the complexity of the moral equation may change in those circumstances, but I would respectfully be asked to be excused from answering that question. 

Senator, I can understand anxiety on both sides of the issue. I also think it is important to distinguish the significance of the subjects that I was talking about a few moments ago. I was not talking about my personal views on the death penalty. I was talking about the personal concern that a judge who believes the death penalty is wrong would have if he is asked to take a part in its administration. With respect to the morality of sentencing on white-collar crime, that did not involve a question of whether it is moral to sentence or not. It involved the question of whether sentencing should take place on the basis of evenhanded standards evenhandedly imposed on all sorts and varieties of crime. And upon that matter, I think there is no division within the country. 

And I believe there is, indeed, a moral obligation for evenhandedness in criminal sentencing. 

On the issue of abortion 

Senator, I think you know from the discussion yesterday afternoon of my concern for the circumstances in which these questions arise. But a discussion of morality in the context of this hearing of the Roe v. Wade decision I believe would be interpreted, in effect, as inconsistent with the view I have expressed that my personal views would not play a part in the decision. And I will respectfully ask you to excuse me from answering that question. 

As you rightly say, we can sometimes accept our losses with great equanimity because we recognized that, in fact, the right result has been achieved. Our responsibility in those circumstances is the responsibility to be the best advocates that we can.As I said this morning, one of the foundations upon which I think the vitality of our constitutional system rests is that there will, in fact, be vigorous litigation to give the courts the best chances that they can have to get it right. And if we play a part in good faith and with vigor in those circumstances, I think we can be proud of ourselves.

That is correct. 

Senator, I doubtless formed an opinion, but the opinion was related to the case that I was arguing. The question that you make assumes that I was arguing, for example, as advocate for the State in the EEOC case, that the EEOC could never lawfully collect statistics when there was an indication that discrimination had taken place. That, of course, was not the position of the State. The argument assumes that in the case of literacy tests I might have been arguing that literacy tests should be enforced, even when they were being enforced for discriminatory purposes. In fact, what I was arguing is that a literacy test which had already been declared constitutional when used for nondiscriminatory purposes should be within the power of the State. 

I think the right result for the Nation was, indeed, achieved. The question in the cases before us was: Can you get the right result for the Nation and still leave States which have216 done no wrong in the position that they were in? The Supreme Court of the United States said, as a practical matter, Congress is correct to say no.

I accept that decision, yes. 

Well, when I say I accept it, I say I am willing to agree that, in fact, Congress has that power and properly used it in those cases. 

Well, if you—sir? 

Are you asking me whether I think literacy tests should be used 

OK. 

I think today the outcome is right. 

On the literacy test, I had a more complex reaction than that. The trouble in the literacy test case was 

The answer is yes with one qualification on the literacy test case, and that was it seemed to me at the time that a State which was acting consistently with the 14th amendment— and the State was—had done no wrong. I think it is correct to say my judgment today is that probably the problem of literacy tests could not have been dealt with as a national problem except in the way that Congress did. But, I would not concede that there was something inappropriate about defending a practice which the Supreme Court of the United States had declared to be constitutional. 

That is a mathematical statement, I think. 

I say that is essentially a kind of statement of math. 

Senator, I think what I was referring to in the quotation that you are making is a problem that Father Hesburgh was not referring to. That is, we were concerned—and I think the context in which that was made—you correct me if I am wrong— was the context in which questions were being placed on constitutional amendments in which the questions themselves were of some great length and complexity, so that somebody who could not read simply could not know what was before that person.

I would not have been engaging in the particular practice in the church/state issue, and I think it is appropriate to have a national collection standard on the EEOC.

I am not sure I would use the word "crusade." 

That was the tenor of it. Senator Kennedy. "Honored him as an historical figure without regard to the religious issue." The thing I would ask you is, did it ever occur to you that that was kind of demeaning religion, Christianity? You know, I mean, I think those of us who have observed Good Friday—12 to 3 are the special hours for the churches. Judge SOUTER. Well, Senator—I am sorry. 

Well, I think, Senator, if that had been my proclamation, I think that would be a very fair objection to it. My own religion is a religion which I wish to exercise in private and with as little public—little expression in the political arena as is possible. Whether or not my client, at the time, believed it was demeaning, I do not know. I am sure he did not intend it in a demeaning way. 

YOU did, yes. 

Well, their employer had been doing so, sir. 

I think it is just the employer who pays in. 

There are three things, I think, that I should say in response to that, Senator. The first is one upon which I do not have a sufficiently detailed recollection to say a great deal. But I believe my recollection is correct that when that case first came before us for review, we found what had happened in the lower administrative tribunals sufficiently unclear that we sent it back with an opportunity to modify what had been done or to clarify the record in some way. And if my recollection is correct, this case had come back to us, in effect, a second time. The second thing is, is there something inappropriate about the factual determination in the case? And I think that is a subject upon which there simply cannot be a sound judgment without recognizing one thing, and that is the fact determination in this case is a fact determination just as in the usual case of an appeal from a trial court. It is a fact determination for the trier of fact and not for the appellate court. The question is whether the trier of fact had a basis in the evidence for coming to the conclusion that it did reach. So this was not a case in which the unanimous Supreme Court was coming to unsympathetic findings. It was a case in which the Supreme Court was faced with the issue that it is always faced with on appeals ofthis sort. Was there an evidentiary basis upon which the finder of fact below could have made the determination that was made?The third thing that I think should be said is whether there is, in that opinion, an insufficient degree of sympathy appropriate to an appellate court. Let me suggest to you that there are two things in that opinion which I think belie that suggestion. The first one, and this is the lesser of the two, in my judgment, is the fact that everyone on the court recognized what, on behalf of myself and the court, I tried to express, I think, at the end of the opinion—I won't say that it is the absolutely last paragraph, but I think it is in there somewhere—about, in fact, how admirable we believed these two men to be.Here they were, at their ages, with health which was uncertain, and yet they had worked as hard as they had and still wanted to go on working, if they could, on a part-time basis rather than simply giving up.And I remember—I don't remember the exact words that we used, but one of the things we did not want to do was to end our opinion without some reference to the fact that we had great respect for the clients—for the petitioners before us.The second thing that I would suggest in determining the kind of the willingness of the court to hear these people's claims goes to the fact that at the end of the opinion, as you pointed out yourself, the court did, in fact—alhough it did not feel itself obligated to do so, it did, in fact, take up the equal protection claim and the Federal claim; I think it was under the Rehabilitation Act.Someone said to me afterwards, if you are really going to be consistent in enforcing your rules about how things must be raised, both at the trial level and brought to you on appeal, why did you make any comment? Why did the court make any comment on those two points?There was really a two-fold answer to that. One was that at the last level of administrative review, there had been a reference to those points and we believed that there was some utility to be gained by referring to it.The second reason is one which, in fact, is not in that opinion. But it is one which I know the court felt, and that is we believed— as you suggested we might be able to do, we believed on the record before us and the law before us, we had come to the only decision that we could come to.We also believed that if we said nothing about the substance of the claims of these two brothers under the equal protection clause and the Rehab Act, they were going to leave our court after that case was over believing that they might very well have had a claim on which they were entitled to win, and yet they had lost it because of some legal technicality or some technicality of the Supreme Court.And we said, basically, these are two good people; they should not spend the rest of their lives believing that on some kind of a legal technicality of procedure they have lost rights that they otherwise would feel entitled to.So we went that extra step out of the way and we looked at their claims on the merits, and I think that is reflective, not just on my part but on the part of the entire court, of a sympathy with the221 claimants before us that was personal to them and that took into account the respect that we felt for them.

Yes, I did. 

I don't think it is set out there, no. I am stating that from recollection and I think my recollection is correct. 

That is correct. 

My best recollection is there has been a remand. 

I believe that is correct. Frankly, the opinion is so complex, I would have to have it before me, but I am sure you are right. 

Well, I think where your question, in a way, Senator, has the advantage is that—and I want to be very careful about what I say on this because I do not recall the procedural history of it, as I said, in any detail prior to that opinion. But I think that if the petitioners had said to us, we don't want an appeal right now, what we want to do is to be able to raise claims below which we didn't in the first instance because we didn't have counsel, I think the court would certainly have considered seriously a request to go back. And the point, as I said earlier, that I simply cannot remember because it has nothing to do with the opinion as we wrote it, is the extent to which such a request was made before the court. The only thing I can remember is—if I remember this correctly, I think there was at least one remand for a clarification of the record, and whether there was an opportunity at that time to enlarge it, I don't remember. 

Senator, what left them out in the cold was a law passed by the legislature of the State which was not unconstitutional. One of the respects which the judiciary must have for the coordinate branches of the Government is that whether we do ordo not like or sympathize with the results that legislatures sometimes give us, if they are constitutional, they are legislative judgments and they are intended to stand.

I believe it was. 

Thank you, sir. 

Mr. Chairman, that is up to you. [Laughter.] 

Senator, the problem that they faced was a regulatory scheme in New Hampshire for the practice of law, which I think probably was characteristic of what would be found in a good many States. There were prohibitions against the practice of law in corporate form unless all members of the corporation which would be providing legal services were, in fact, attorneys admitted topractice. And the only exception to that rule was for the benefit of corporations, legal corporations, that would be providing services to the poor alone.

Well, we had to address it first on the level of statutory construction to see if, in fact, the New Hampshire statutes were as restrictive as they had been assumed to be. And to make a somewhat long story short, we found that they meant what they said. As a result of that, the Court was faced with a genuine first amendment challenge based upon the right to associate exemplified in cases like NAACP v. Button, and basically the claim that was made was that the New Hampshire statute was unenforceable because individuals, not necessarily all lawyers, were entitled to associate together for the purposes of advocating and, if appropriate, litigating the constitutional rights of their members. The claim was that the New Hampshire statutes, in restricting the Disability Rights Center from representing those who were not poor in such challenges and in restricting their membership, or purporting to do so, to those who were only lawyers, were, in fact, infringing on the kind of associational right which the Button case had recognized. Having confronted the issue squarely, it was, in fact, our judgment, expressed in an opinion that I wrote, that there was such an infringement. In the course of doing so, we dealt with some of the State's claims of countervailing interests necessary for the regulation of the practice of law, and we confronted the State's claim that, in fact, there had not been a demonstration; that in the absence of recognizing this associational right and without allowing the Disability Rights Center to engage in the representation that it proposed to do, the State argued there had been no claim that these people would be denied legal services entirely. What we recognized in the course of our own examination of the case, and expressed in the opinion, is that this simply was not a sufficient countervailing State purpose which was adequate to in any way trump the first amendment claim that had been made. We therefore recognized it. We declared the New Hampshire statutes regulating and restricting the practice of law to that extent unconstitutional, and we decreed that the Disability Rights Center could do exactly what it proposed to do. 

Thank you, Senator. 

They did; and I think it is probably also unquestionable that there is a further public benefit in a case like this. It is the same kind of public benefit that I alluded to when I was speaking on Friday with Senator Thurmond about the provision of legal services in the criminal area. That is, the result of allowing organizations like the Disability Rights Center to provide this kind of representation is to develop a body of expertise among a seg-ment of the bar that we would be unlikely to see if this kind of informal specialization were not allowed. And I think just as in the area of the criminal law, I think in the long run there is no question that the quality of advocacy on this subject will be better in very practical ways as a result of what the Rights Center is doing.

Well, Senator, as you know, I think one of the points of common ground from which all of the parties and all of those with strong opinions on that case begin is that when there is a stop for a sobriety checkpoint, there is, to a very limited degree, a search and seizure and inquiry subject to fourth amendment standards. In New Hampshire, and I daresay probably all of the State constitutions, the stop and the inquiry is subject to regulation under their search and seizure provisions.What we do not have in this kind of case is the sort of inquiry which is exemplified by the situation in which there is a search for evidence of prior crime, which, as you know, as a general rule must take place under the auspices of a warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate. Because at the point automobiles are asked to pull over for a sobriety checkpoint, there simply is not the particularized knowledge about what may be found inside which would support a warrant under the traditional probable cause standards of the criminal law.What, therefore, the court did—and what, indeed, I did in my dissent—was to engage basically in an analysis which balanced the State and the private interests involved to determine whether the stop and the inquiry could be regarded as a reasonable one within the standards applicable to search and seizures, both for State and national purposes.What we are particularly concerned with in these kinds of cases is that the discretion of the police be something other than an uncontrolled roving and inquiry covering no matter what period of time, no matter what elements of surprised and fright. The concern is to require a very tightly controlled discretion on the part of the police who may engage in these sobriety checkpoints which does not go one iota beyond what is necessary to satisfy the public interest in detecting driving under the influence before a tragedy occurs.What we found or what I analyzed in my dissenting opinion in that case is that the practices there under consideration were, indeed, consistent with the need for strict control of this kind of discretion. The searches, the stops, were not at random. They followed a particular set plan at the beginning. They were very short in duration. The intrusion of the stops was comparatively minor. And there was no discretion given to the police to go beyond what seemed absolutely necessary to detect the one significant fact which was of concern to them.The majority of the court in my case took what seemed to me a somewhat restrictive view of the demonstration of utility that was necessary. They were concerned that, despite the use of sobriety checkpoints, the great majority of arrests and prosecutions for driving under the influence still eventuated from routine controls and the kinds of police observation which, in the absence of checkpoints, would bring drunken driving to their attention. As you know from my opinion, I thought that they were taking an unduly restrictive view of what was necessary mathematically to justify these checkpoints.The third point upon which the majority and I disagreed was a subject which I think was well raised; that is, in allowing a sobriety checkpoint like this, is the court starting down the road which would then lead to the possibility of what I think someone described as shopper checkpoints, whereby the police could stop anybody on the street and look in shopping bags and so on to see whether the merchandise in them was accompanied by a sales slip. Was it, in other words, sort of the thin end of the wedge for watering down very important fourth amendment protections?My response to that was that we couldn't answer that question without attending very carefully to the kind of activity that was under consideration. And I contrasted the activity of driving an automobile which, simply because of the power of an automobile to harm, was a very highly regulated activity. The machinery was regulated; the people who operated the machinery were regulated; they had to pass tests of competence before they would even be allowed legally behind the car. And I contrasted that, as I said, with the kind of innocent activity of shopping, which, with the exception of things like pedestrian safety laws, is not a regulated activity.I said that in judging what is reasonable, we have to take into consideration the potential danger which the activity poses and the State's expression of that danger by its decision to regulate or not to regulate it. And what might, indeed, be a perfectly reasonable inquiry in a highly dangerous and regulated activity, like driving, would not be reasonable at all in an innocent pursuit like walking down Main Street and doing errands. And I therefore concluded that there was not a danger, that a sobriety checkpoint approval under the fourth amendment was going to be taken as thin end of the wedge for an assault on civil liberties. I think that view has since been recognized.

Yes, sir, I will. What the case on that particular point boiled down to was a question of whether the friend to whom the defendant has made his admissions was, in fact, acting as an agent of the State for the purpose of soliciting those admissions and, of course, passing them on to the police after he had received them. It, again, is common ground that if any criminal defendant makes a spontaneous admission or confession to a third party, as a general rule the third party, of course, is perfectly free to repeat that, and the State is perfectly free to use that as a matter of evidence.The difficulty comes when the State is using ostensible third parties to make an end run about regulations on confessions under the fifth amendment and under the sixth amendment. And the question, therefore, in that case was: Was the friend, in effect, acting as an agent for the State so that every activity of the friend in talking and, indeed, in listening to the defendant should be imputed to the State and judged as if the friend were, in fact, a police officer working on the case?At the time the case came to us, there was no law under the New Hampshire Constitution on that matter. And because the defendant raised both State and constitutional claims in support of his argument that the statement should be kept out, the first task that we had was, in effect, to read the New Hampshire Constitution to try to determine what was behind its provisions, providing the right to counsel as well as rights against compelled self-incrimination against the defendant; and to determine whether the princi-229 pies that the New Hampshire Constitution embodied were, in fact, being violated by the use of the friend, as it were, as a conduit for information in this case.What we determined was that the test that we should employ to determine whether an end run was being made around these constitutional guarantees was to determine whether the friend should be regarded as an agent of the police or as, in effect, a free third party who passed things along. And the test or tests that we came up with came down to the question: Was the friend acting at the behest of or under some kind of a contractual arrangement with the police so that he thought that he was doing an expected job for them or was doing something for which they had indicated he would receive some benefit?What we were doing was trying to find a basis to determine whether there was an agency relationship. In asking those questions, we found that there was none in the case before us. We didn't use the exact terminology that the Federal courts have used in discussing similar issues under the national Constitution, but I think we came down with a substantially similar standard.What the Federal cases ask for in these instances is whether there was such a substantial relationship between the third party and the police that, in fact, there should be really seen as an identity between the two of them. And applying that test, we likewise found that there was no agency relationship in the case, and we held that the statements had properly been admitted.

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, Senator Metzenbaum, there is, of course, no question that the Court does have that jurisdiction and obligation. Its obligation is constantly to search, to identify those rights which are fundamental, and to implement them. In my exchange with Senator Grassley last week when I made the remark about the constitutional vacuum, I was thinking, in fact, of a particular example, and I don't remember now whether I went on to that example or not. But I was thinking specifically with reference to the 14th amendment. I thought the case of Brown v. Board of Education was an example of what can happen, because the unusual situation in the case of the 14th amendment is that under section 1 there are provisions which are to be applied by the judiciary, following justiciable standards, and under section 5, Congress has its own specific enforcement power there. And as you know, for some time before the Brown decision came down,there were requests and hopes that there would be legislation to deal with the continuing problem of segregation in the schools. But no political solution was forthcoming.Therefore, that is what I had in mind when I spoke of there being a vacuum in which the responsibility to deal with a 14th amendment problem had to be faced, and the Court rightly faced it.

Senator, there is no question about it. If that were not the case, there would be no point in having a Bill of Rights. If that were not the case, there would be no point in having any substantive protection for civil liberties. We would leave the entire issue to whatever majoritarian impulse there might be at the time, and we would have a vastly different society from the one which the Framers of the Bill of Rights intended us to have.

Senator, those considerations to me point exactly to the kind of inquiry which the Court must make. As I said, in dealing with the question of what unenumerated rights may be regarded as fundamental and what require a lesser standard of scrutiny, the courts from time to time have tried different tests. One ofthose tests was the one that is identified with Palco v. Connecticut in which we asked whether the right in question is essential to or comprehended by the concept of ordered liberty.I think I indicated that my own view of the best approach to these problems is the one which is probably best identified with the late Justice Harlan. Justice Harlan said that we cannot approach these questions of weighing the value of asserted rights without an inquiry into the history and the traditions of the American people, in order to try to find on a historically demonstrable basis their commitment to a set of values which either do or do not support the claim that a particular right in question is fundamental.I think Justice Harlan, in taking that approach—I am convinced that Justice Harlan in taking that approach was, in effect, asking for a broader inquiry than we might be engaging in if we limited ourselves to the formulation in Palco v. Connecticut, the concept of ordered liberty, because, as was demonstrated in many other cases, there are many limitations upon what we regard as almost garden variety constitutional rights which still could be found in a society which we would not say was fundamentally unjust. Do we have a right to a jury of 6 or a jury of 12, for example?I think Justice Harlan, although he himself quoted the Palco formulation from time to time, I think he was clearly pointing to a broader inquiry into the history and traditions of the American people as being the basis upon which a fundamental valuation or a finding of no fundamental valuation should rest. And I think he was right.

I came to that conclusion, Senator, because, in fact, it is a subject which has received a great deal of attention within the courts themselves. Much has been said over the years about the proper way to interpret cases like Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v. Society of Sisters. But leaving aside the interpretive categorical problems that constitutional lawyers may come up with, one thing that is undeniable is that going right back to the discussion of those cases in the early part of this century, the courts have recognized a kind of core of what might be called marital or family liberty. And it has become so familiar to us that we can at least start with that core in any inquiry about the scope of unenumerated rights or their fundamental character. I don't want to rest this discussion on a purely ad hominem basis, but, of course, I have to come right back to the Justice that I was referring to before. Justice Harlan engaged in an examination like this, as you know, both in his own opinion in Griswold and in the opinion that preceded that case, Poe v. Ullman. So, in a way, it seems to me that the notion of a marital privacy and a privacy which takes into account certain basic familial values has got to be our starting point. I think we have plowed that ground well, and I think we do have a secure starting point there. 

Well, of course, I think it is very clear—again, there is no real dispute about this, I think, among people on both sides of this issue—that even marital privacy is not free from regulation by the State. A spouse is not entitled to assault another spouse. We do not build a sort of shield against all State intrusion. There certainly is an example of a subject which I suppose somebody could argue ought to be within the shield of scrutiny from State concern, and yet I think we would all agree that that was a reasonable subject of regulation, without which we would have an extremely barbaric marital society.

Well, I agree that Eisenstadt v. Baird engaged in an appropriate analysis. I didn't go back and reread it this weekend. I probably should have. But my recollection from reading Eisenstadt is that the case rested primarily on an equal protection analysis; and that having found in the Griswold case as they did, the Court then felt it was appropriate to apply an equal protection criterion going beyond the express due process concepts that they had come up with in Griswold. And I think there is no question that the area of privacy is not immune to this kind of equal protection analysis any more than any other subject of the law is.

I would just like to enter this caveat: that because I have not reread Eisenstadt v. Baird, there may be some things in there that I am just not adverting to. But on the basic proposition that I refer to, the equal protection analysis based on the point at which Griswold left off, I would see no basis to approach the problem differently.

I don't know the extent an answer to that question can be given in the abstract without the kind of Harlan inquiry that I'm talking about. It was not made and I have not made it. The thing that I can say is that if that question had come up before Griswold as you posit, exactly the same kind of analysis that Harlan would have used and did use in his concurring opinion should be used to address the same issue of nonmarital privacy.

I think, yes, I think it is wrong simply to draw that conclusion because as you, yourself, have pointed out in the analyses that go on, there is a two-part inquiry. The first inquiry is No. 1: Is there a liberty interest to be asserted and how may it be valued? The other inquiry that goes on is, when, in fact, is the weight to be given to the State interest which may be brought up as a countervailing interest when the liberty interest is, in some way, restricted? One of the questions, of course, that would have to be asked if we were approaching Eisenstadt first and not Griswold first, is not merely the weight to be given to the privacy interest to be asserted, but the weight to be given to the State interest in asserting the right to preclude people under those circumstances from obtaining contraceptive information and devices. I do not think that is a simple question to answer. 

No. I do not have a concern to raise about it at this point, Senator. What I was referring to, I think, in my remarks to Senator Thurmond, was probably an historical fact. It illustrates something in our constitutional history which is not just confined to the commerce clause. That is the sense of State autonomy which doubtless motivated the Framers, I think, probably got a jolt as early as the tenure of John Marshall when it came to commerce clause analysis.I think many of the Framers probably had not thought through the generality of the grant of power which Marshall recognized so early in our history. I think this phenomenon is probably paralleled in another example that we have been talking about in the course of these hearings and that is the effect of the powers granted to the courts, and indeed, to the Congress under the 14th amendment.I remember in our discussion the other day about the appropriateness of Brown as a decision. We all agreed, I think, that historically none of the Framers of the equal protection clause would have had the slightest inkling that that clause was ever going to be applied to school desegregation. They doubtless would not have had the slightest inkling that that clause was going to be applied to sex discrimination.Yet, the fact is they wrote a clause of great generality which they did not confine to the specific objects which they had in mind or had contemplated when they passed it. Therefore, as I was saying last week, the legitimacy of the application of the equal protection clause to school desegregation, to gender discrimination, and so on seems to me beyond argument.I think probably historically the same phenomenon has gone on with the commerce clause. They wrote more generally than they probably intended by way of application at the time that they wrote it, but they wrote what they wrote.

Well, that is true. I would repeat something that I have said before, but I don't want to leave any mistake on this.My approach to interpretation is not a specific intent approach. The approach has got to take into consideration the text of the provisions in question and it is not to be confined, the meaning of that text is not to be confined by reference simply to the specific applications that may have been, as it were, in the mind either individually or institutionally of the people who proposed the amendment.We are looking, when we look for the original meaning, we are looking for meaning and for principle. We are not confining ourselves simply to immediately intended application.

Absolutely not. 

I don't think in view of the understanding of the commerce powers you, yourself, have said since the late 1930's, since the NLRB, I don't think there is. I recall the analysis in McClung and it came down to a straight factual analysis. That is, would the segregation, if it were permitted in these accommodations have an effect on the flow of goods in interstate commerce; would it have an effect on the movement of people in interstate commerce? The Court, as you know, had no difficulty in concluding that it would have such effects, and therefore, that it was within the power of the, within the scope of the commerce power for Congress to regulate. 

Yes. In fact, I would like, if I may, Senator, respond to a couple of the specific points you made.Let me start, of course with that one. When I went back to check on this when the subject first came up, the only record that I could find—to begin with, I didn't recall the contribution at all—but the only record that I could find was the record of the action by the Governor and Council which I think was on June 30, when they had accepted or had on their agenda to accept the contribution of around 70-or-74-whatever it was, thousand dollars from the Public Service Company.I had not been aware of the Manchester Union Leader report on May 15, and you have seen a copy of the paper and I am sure that's accurate.The report was something I was not aware about, until you just told me now. But I think going to the issues of substance that you raise, I think there are two particular points that I do want to emphasize.The first is that at no time did I engage in a solicitation of the Public Service Company or, indeed, of anyone else, except the New Hampshire Legislature for funds to defray the costs of the law enforcement work and the prosecution.The request for those funds that were made came, as I recall and I think as has been reported here, from the Governor. The only consultation that I had with him that I have any recollection of is my preparation to go to the legislature, as I said, to ask for funds.I can state categorically that the Public Service Company had no consultation with me about what would be an appropriate response by me as a prosecutor or by what would be appropriate policy for me as a prosecutor in appearing before the courts. There was no238 consultation, there was no message going back and forth, and I would not have tolerated one.I made the decisions that I made based on what I thought were evenhanded law enforcement criteria, considering, among other things, other cases of civil disobedience which had been prosecuted, particularly in the State of New Hampshire in recent years.So, there was no opportunity and there was, in fact, no influence by the Public Service Company or by any other contributor of funds to the State of New Hampshire, in my position as attorney general.The second thing that I think it is important to say is something which you rightly raise, and that is when the State, regardless of who solicits the money, when the State receives funds in a case like this from what might be regarded as a party in interest, two dangers arise and they simply cannot be divorced from those situations.The first danger is that we are starting down the road, not as a particular attorney general's office which may not have been involved in it, but simply as a State, we are starting down the road of dependence upon people with particular interests in the specific subjects of law enforcement, which would tend to give them an opportunity for an influence which they should not have.The second concern is related to the first, and that is whether particular parties or groups in interest do exert that kind of influence. When funds are accepted in this manner, there is a risk of an appearance that they would have had this influence

And the appearance that justice can be deflected by this should be avoided. If I had been consulted as to whether or not these funds should be accepted or, indeed, solicited, if there was any specific solicitation, I trust that my answer would have been no, for exactly that reason.

Yes; I think that would have been an appropriate position to take and I wish I had taken it.

I am almost certain that I did not. I did not go through the preprotest meetings. The deputy attorney general did, Mr. Cruz did, so I am reasonably certain I was not at that meeting.

I can only say that I have no recollection of it whatever.

NO; I had not seen his deposition, again, until you referred to it now.

Senator, may I—I am sorry. 

I am sorry. I was going to say, I think in one respect I just misspoke inadvertently. I said I did not see his deposition again. I am not sure that I have ever read his deposition. 

We learn as we go along. 

I say we learn as we go along. There is one other thing, if I may, that I would like to add, not because I think I said anything that gave a contrary impression, but I think it should be put on the record, and that is that, in this kind of maelstrom of events surrounding the Seabrook protest. At no time, did Governor Thomson ever tell me what he wanted to do, as a matter of law enforcement, with the protesters.Despite his feistiness and his assertiveness, he was in this instance, and I think in our general relationship, he was respectful of my role as attorney general, and at no point did he tell me I think you ought to recommend this or recommend that. That issue was left to me, and the Governor was very careful to do that.

I think you are giving me a hint, Senator. [Laughter.] I certainly do not want to start my answer by saying that the last thing in the world I would want to be taken for is a politician. [Laughter.] But I think I had better go back, as I did a moment ago, to the specific context that I had in mind when I made that statement. Let me start it with a couple of general thoughts. The first is that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States, of the lower Federal courts, of every State court inAmerica is derived from the Constitutions that respectively create those courts. It is not derived from perceptions at the moment about what ought to be done.Courts do not self-define their jurisdictions and they do not have the authority to define them simply when they perceive what they think is a vacuum in the political process which leaves a problem unsolved.What I had in mind when I made that statement was the example of the 14th amendment example in Brown. There are a great many who argued at the time and certainly have argued since that we might have been better off if the Brown decision had been not that of the Supreme Court, but had been the

Certainly not. The Supreme Court's action in the Brown case was derived from the fact that it was charged with enforcing the Constitution, including the provisions of section 1 of the 14th amendment, not section 5. Section 5 is an empowerment of the Congress alone.But the situation that was presented to the American populace at that time was a situation in which Congress could have taken some action and which the courts, acting under section 1, had a responsibility to take some action.The fact was that for 58 years, separate but equal was the law of the United States, and no political branch of the Government responded to modify that, including the Congress under its section 5 power, and, therefore, it was incumbent upon the Supreme Court, when Brown v. Board of Education came down, to apply the equal protection clause as it thought right, and in my judgment, as I have said, I think there is no question, it applied it correctly.But there is an example of a case, and that is the one that I had in mind, in which there had been no action by the political branches and, therefore, sooner or later, there was no question that a justiciable issue would be brought before the Court and that the Court would say the time has come to act upon it.But let me leave no mistaken impression in your mind that the jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court to act in that case had nothing whatsoever to do, one way or the other, with what any other branch of the Government did or did not do. The Court's jurisdiction derived from the Constitution and from its obligation to apply section 1 of the 14th amendment, and vacuums do not create jurisdiction.

NO; the former is exactly what I mean. 

No. Section 5 of the 14th amendment empowers Congress to implement the provisions of the amendment itself and, as you know, Congress is moving these days to do exactly that.

I assure you, I would not regard it in that light. [Laughter.]

Yes. Judge GRASSLEY. This answer came right on the heels of your talking about filling vacuums, when the people's branches or the political branches of Government might be slow to act, so I would like some elaboration. Please give me an example of when you think the Supreme Court improperly created rights and one when you think they properly recognized rights. Judge SOUTER. Well, I do not want to over-use the example, but I think I cannot give a better example on the proper recognition of rights than Brown itself. The Court in that case recognized that the equal protection provisions of the 14th amendment were not confined to those specific problems that were in the minds of the Framers as the objects of its application in 1868. The Court recognized that there was as general concept of equal protection and it was just as applicable to school segregation as to other enterprises. If you simply read the text of the Constitution and somebody said, well, where does it refer to schools, where does it refer to school desegregation, of course, you would not have found anything there, but I think clearly implicit in the text of the Constitution itself and in the concept of due process was the proper basis for the Court's exercise of its jurisdiction. 

Well, in order to 

Well, in so doing, the Court had to recognize and did recognize that the right under section 1 of the 14th amendment, the right to the equal protection of the laws, was a right which applied to those particular plaintiffs and applied to the subject of school desegregation. So, in order to strike down the State laws, what the Court had to do was to recognize the right of the plaintiffs, in effect, to strike them down or to have them struck down. So, I think it was doing both, but in order to do so, it had to recognize the plaintiffs right. 

Well, take the criminal procedure area as an example. I think so much of the difficulty that the States had with some of the Warren court decisions came in part, came in large measure from the difficulty of administering them. One could, I suppose, perfectly well argue today—as many people argued in the 1960's—that there was not a warrant to impose the exclusionary rule, for example, on the States once it was understood that the fourth amendment standards applied to the States.But the difficulty that the States had under the exclusionary rule—and I can speak from experience here because I was in the trenches in those days. I was an assistant attorney general, and I was concerned with criminal administration. The difficulty that the States were having was the difficulty in learning how to do what the Court had held that the States ought to be doing.I can remember in those days lecturing at State police training academies on the requirements to demonstrate in applications for search warrants what was known as credibility and reliability of the sources of information, what people in the business refer to as the old twin Aguilar-Spinelli tests.It was very difficult for law enforcement officers and for judges in the field to engage in the kind of very close textual analysis almost of search warrant applications which seemed to be called for by Aguilar and Spinelli. A great many of those difficulties have been alleviated in the meantime as the Court has moved from the kind of the technicality of those two-pronged tests to a test which looks rather to the overall effect of the warrant and does not rely on that kind of technicality.The difficulty that we were having was the difficulty in understanding exactly what it was that the Court was requiring and how to go about satisfying it. One of the most telling experiences that I can remember having that illustrates this point was in the course of an argument in the Supreme Court of New Hampshire after the Spinelli case had come down. One of the justices on the New Hampshire Supreme Court said to me, "Do you believe that Spinelli has changed the law?" I said, "No, I don't." I said, "I think the standards are the same after Spinelli as they were before."And he said, "Well, that is my view, too, but," he said, "you know, not everybody agrees with us." And if you looked at the opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court in the Spinelli case, you would see, as I recall, that the Justices themselves could not agree on whether they were coming up with anything new in the Spinelli case or not. And that is why I say I think the great difficulties that we labored under some of the Warren decisions was in implementing them, in trying to understand what they meant, and that is why I think I said the other day that in the meantime we have learned to live with a great deal, and lived with them pretty well today.

Going to the latter part of your question, I think what I was referring to on last Thursday were the—I think we were talking—I don't know, but I think we were talking about the area of criminal procedure again. A lot of the decisions in that period were what I would describe as kind of pragmatic implementing decisions. I think probably everyone would agree that the Court could have gone on reviewing confessions simply on the basis of the voluntariness standard which was implicit in the concept of due process, which the Court had been doing for some time; and that it could have continued to do that without adopting the Miranda tests.What the Miranda tests were were intended to be a very pragmatic procedure that would cut down on the likelihood, cut down on the degree of possibility that confessions actually would turn out to be involuntary confessions. Was it right for the Court to say we have just reached the point where the judicial system cannot continue to go on litigating every case for voluntariness under due process? We have got somehow to have a more pragmatic approach to this that is going to cut down on the number of problems.People of good will could disagree about that, but the fact is, at the time the Miranda decision came down, it created a lot of problems for people who didn't know how to respond to it. Those problems are over and done with today. I think most law enforcement officers can respond to it, and anyone who wants to attack Miranda today has got, I think, the same kind of pragmatic burden which those had who argued for Miranda in the first place. What would be the effect of changing it? Was Miranda the creation of a new right, or was Miranda, in fact, an experiment by the Supreme Court in how to protect a right?People can argue back and forth on the terminology. I personally have looked at Miranda as a pragmatic decision intended to protect a right, and the only sense in which I think probably you can say there was an extension of a right was that sense which Justice Harlan referred to when he said that what Miranda had done was to extend the fifth amendment from the courtroom to the police station. But I think the reason the Court was taking the tack that it was taking was not merely for the purpose, or for the purpose of extending rights so much as in trying to find a pragmatic way to protect those rights. And it was a very difficult pragmatic way at the time the opinion came down, unlike the situation today.

Thank you, Senator. 

I think it was. But I will tell you, Mr. Chairman, I think the Harlan dissent was a very powerful dissent. And the truth is I don't have a simple answer to the Harlan dissent. I don't have a simple answer to it today. As you know, Justice Harlan relied so heavily on the provisions of section 2 of the 14th amendment for saying that that was an indication that any problem of the maldistribution of votes or the apportionment of votes was intended to have a congressional solution period. And yet on the other side, you would be facing the fact that there was less protection for this most fundamental right than there would have been for one of the garden variety economic rights. And that argument of his was a tough argument. 

I think I would have to have gone along with it, yes. 

Well, Senator, I think I can recall some. That test has a peculiar history. To the best of my knowledge, the first case in which the middle-tier scrutiny test, substantial relationship to important government objective, the first case in which that was mentioned was a case early in the century, and it was an economic regulation case. It may have been an antitrust case. It was an economic regulation case, in any event, and one of the parties was a corporation known as the Royster Guano Co. I don't remember the other party, but I will never forget Royster Guano.The issue in that case, as I said, was strictly one of economic regulation. It is the kind of issue which today would merit what we would call first-tier, rational basis analysis. And, in fact, that was exactly the kind of treatment that Royster Guano got. So this test which today is being used and has evolved into a middle-tier test began its life right down at the other end of the spectrum.Some of the cases that have applied it as a middle-tier test even since then have seemed to me, as I have read the opinions, to seem to slide back and forth as to whether they were applying middletier or first-tier. I think someone the other day mentioned the case of Reed v. Reed, which involved an issue of probate administration and the eligibility of a woman to serve under the same conditions or subject to the same conditions of eligibility as a man. There are portions of the Reed opinion in which they seem to be doing nothing but applying first-tier analysis.

And at the other end of the spectrum, I had a case in which I wrote a separate opinion on the New Hampshire Supreme Court this past year in which I know my colleagues did not agree with me, but it seemed to me that they were using the middle-tier test for the highest level of scrutiny. And so it is examples like that that have made me wish that we could come up with a less flexible formulation. That is a lot easier said than done. I hope you are not going to say to me, "OK, Judge, here is your chance, give us the word," because I don't have an alternative formulation written. 

I think the reason why we tend not to be quite so concerned about the flexibility in the highest tier test, the compelling State interest test, is that traditionally we have been working with classifications which affected rights of such fundamental importance that it was very, very difficult for anybody to meet the test. Therefore, there has tended, I think, just as a historical matter, to be fewer cases calling for third tier, the highest level of scrutiny, which have seemed to be debatable cases at all. And you are entirely right to say, well, compelling interest, that calls for an evaluation. Narrowly tailored, that calls for it. And you are entirely right. If you look at some of the recent cases that have come down on examining race-conscious remedial order by courts. They are being subject to the highest level of scrutiny.

And yet, for example, when you come down to narrow tailoring, there is undoubtedly room for maneuvering there in the kind of factor analysis that has gone into the narrowly tailoring analysis. 

It is a fact. There is no human formulation that is going to give you any kind of mathematical precision. And as I think I said when I first brought up the subject the other day, I am by no means convinced that I can do better at it. But the examples that we have been through, of which I gave you some 

I was referring to opinion polls about the rightness of their decisions or not. 

And I will stand by my answer there. I will say that I would be much more comfortable to look to what legislatures do, for example, in expressing the sense of the communities on matters of appropriate criminal penalties. So I would look at them very warily because I think we have better evidence. 

You know what Charles Evans Hughes said: "They read the papers."

I can tell you one nominee who doesn't unless he is visiting somebody.

Well, I'm not about to get rid of that set right now, if that's the case.

That is fair to say. 

I think that would be an insupportable decision under the Constitution and I say that, sir, with a recognition that there are members of the Supreme Court who disagree with me. But that is an opinion which I could not join.

With the hindsight of history there is an experimental cast to some of them. As you know, over the years, for example, on the exclusionary rule there have been calls within the Supreme Court to turn the Mapp decision around on the grounds that it has simply not worked out, and that that is a fact which the Court ought to face.I don't know of any theoretically satisfactory way of saying when a pragmatic experiment sort of crosses that line it is something that has to be condemned as activism. The courts have got an obligation to, in effect, enforce standards. In the Miranda area what the courts were concerned with was the amount of litigation which was going into the question whether given confessions or admissions had been obtained voluntarily or not, was simply placing such a severe burden on the courts themselves, that there had to be a better way to protect the ultimate interest which the 14th amendment was trying to protect without, in fact, tying the courts up in the kind of litigation which just seemed endless, fact-specific, and detailed.The idea was if the police can get the Miranda warnings right, they're going to obviate a large percentage of the voluntariness cases. So that in the long run, law enforcement and judicial administration are going to be more efficient. Well, that was not a very easy argument to sell to law enforcement when Miranda came down, as you well know.But the fact is the intent of the Miranda decision was an intent to provide better administration for the imposition of a standard which we all, on each side of the issue, recognize had to be enforced.

Well, it was its own problems and it was law enforcement's problems, too. Yes, it was experimentation.I remember 

I am sorry. 

NO, that is all right. 

Well, as I said a minute ago, I wish that I had a neat formulation for it. At the very least, in searching for the line we have got to keep in mind what I said in my discussion with Senator Thurmond. It is one thing to try to come up with a pragmaticapproach to the enforcement of a constitutional value or standard which is, itself, accepted. It is another thing to derive standards based simply on personal judicial views of what would be desirable in the world.I will grant you that when we get into the area of pragmatic experimentation, that can be a darn tough line to draw and I don't know of any theoretically easy way to tell you how we would do it.

Well, I don't think it should be seen as any peculiarly interpretivist issue. Regardless of what your view may be of the various schools of interpretivism, the fact is that the courts have got an obligation to come down with practical decrees that implement whatever rights and standards we do find in the Constitution.When we are talking about decisions like Miranda, we are talking about the best way for a Court to exercise its—I guess you might call its prudential power, to get to the right result, to enforce the appropriate standard with the least amount of damage to the body politic—because there is a price to be paid when confessions are thrown out—and with the least damage to the judicial system, which is constantly overwhelmed with litigation. I guess I tend to look upon that as an issue more about the appropriate scope of the Court's power to fashion remedies than an issue of interpretivism about constitutional meaning as such.There is, of course—and this was true of the 1960's and 1970's and it is always in the background of our thinking today that when that kind of pragmatic experimentation does go on, it has an effect on the Federal balance in the country, too. I think it is safe to say that that is a value which the Court has also got to bear in mind and that is not merely prudential.

Let me, if I may—let me approach it this way. I do not rule out the possibility of that coming back before the Court, but I think what I can probably say to it is that—and I have said similar things from the bench in New Hampshire—that if that issue does come back or one similar to it, I think there is an obligation on those who want to raise it to address the pragmatic issues. How is it working today? How do we assess, if you say the price is high, how do we assess that price? What do we really know about what is going on?I think we are engaged in significant measure if such an issue comes up in a very pragmatic weighing, and it must be addressed that way.

Well, I think that is a way of expressing, Senator,a conclusion that you have to approach on what I call the thresh-old question of the matter of precedent, and that is, was the deci-sion wrong or not?

Well, as you know, Senator, that is an issue thatno matter how things turn out the Court is going to be revisiting.The scope of the decision of last term is subject, as you know, togreat debate, and I think I have got to be very careful about what Iwould say on that.

I think I would start by addressing it, by askingwhether, in fact, that question really has to be raised? I do not saythat lightly.One of the peculiarities of last term's case was the fact that thecase came to the Court in almost a friendly posture. A decree wasbeing worked out in that case on a cooperative basis and, in fact,the school administrators were apparently very well satisfied to in-clude a great many extremely expensive items in the decree whichthe Court was being asked to enforce, as you know, as a remedy toa school segregation issue.The case seemed to come to the Court in the posture that wecan't afford all of the other things that we have got to spendmoney on and fund all of the very expansive details of this consentdecree consistently with the tax rate that we can impose, subject tocertain State restrictions on the raising of school taxes.The case was presented to the Court in that posture. It seems tome one of the issues that ought to be faced before the question ofthe Court's remedial power is finally decided is whether that is theposture in which such a case should come before the Court?For example, shouldn't the issue be phrased in these terms, thatonce a decree is ordered by the Court, the question is not whethernecessarily taxes have got to be raised and, if so, under what au-thority they may be raised to do it, but whether, in fact, the politi-cal branches of the Government responsible have made a decisionthat they are going to put the implementation of this court decreefirst. They are going to give that its highest priority in funding.Because if that is the appropriate way to go about it, if there is,as it were, a primacy of obligation to obey a court order, then thereal question that is going to face the local taxing authorities is not whether they have to raise taxes to fund the court order on top of everything else, but whether they are going to continue to fund everything else in addition to the court order?It seemed to me that one of the difficulties of trying to focus the issue in last term's case is that the political priorities at the local level simply don't seem to have been addressed. If they are addressed, there is a real question in my mind as to whether or when the Federal courts are going to get to the point of having to rule on the question that so many people take that case of last term as really standing for, and that is the right to impose or order the imposition of a property tax.

Ultimately we will. I say we, we on the judiciary will, where I will be on the judiciary, I will not say. 

I think you are going to have a fight on the committee here, Senator. [Laughter.]

Thank you very much, sir. 

I appreciate that, sir. [Laughter.] 

I think I can claim privilege on that, Mr. Chairman. [Laughter.] 

Thank you, sir. [Short recess.] 

Senator, I think the approach to that question is a two-fold one. The first is, I know certainly from my familiarity with my own 1784 constitution in New Hampshire, and I can speak with equal certainty of the national Constitution, that the taxing power in the sense of the Framers understood that is a power subject to the separation of powers was legislative, it was not judicial.The difficulty in the question that faces us and that was facing the Supreme Court and, I presume from what I have been told this morning, will definitely face the Supreme Court again, is in drawing a line, if indeed a line is to be drawn there, between the appropriate scope of the judicial power in enforcing its own decrees and the point at which those decrees cannot be enforced without a tax increase.When I spoke earlier of what seemed to me the failure or uncertainty of the means by which political priorities had been addressed at the local level, what I was trying to get at was that we never take on a constitutional issue if there is a means of adjudicating on a nonconstitutional basis. And it seems to me that the question of how far the court's remedial authority goes, when it runs smack up against a lack of money in the local treasury, should be posed in this way. I do not think it should be posed by saying will this judicial remedy exhaust the treasury; it should be posed by saying can this judicial remedy be enforced within the money available to government, bearing in mind that government may have to put the judicial remedy first and decide that there are other priorities for which it would like to spend which it can no longer spend for, without raising taxes.

Well, I do not think the court has the authority to establish the priority as such, but I think that the constitutional issue does not really arise, unless the priorities or it does not arise in a way which requires adjudication, unless those priorities have been addressed at the political level, the local level. In other words

I would suppose that the answer to that is clearly no, because the Senate of the United States is not going to be the party to the kind of litigation which the Yonkers litigation produced. In other words, the Senate of the United States, I presume, is not going to be a defendant in a civil rights action.

Of course, the 

Of course, the difference is that the city council of Yonkers, NY, is bound by the supremacy clause of the Constitution, so that there is an entirely different structural relationship between the two. The second difference, it seems to me, is that the suit, even if in fact there were a Federal action, the suit would not be against the Senate of the United States, it would be against a subordinate branch, a subordinate contingent of the executive branch. The third difference would be that the Court in those circumstances, if the executive branch could not get the funding to do the construction and so on, would have an alternative, not merely the alternative of ordering relief as in the Yonkers housing case, but it would have the alternative of nonappropriation or nonfinancial relief under the habeas power over conditions of prisoners, so I do not think the Senate of the United States could ever possibly be in that position. 

I accept as a general rule, just as you said, Senator, that statutory interpretations are entitled to the highest claim to be followed for the very reason that as statutory interpretations, if there is anything wrong with them, legislatures—in this case, the Congress—can take action to change them.One of the kinds of facts that I don't know about the controversy over Griggs and Ward's Cove goes to an issue of precedent that I got into to some degree last week. We sometimes raise it under the term of "acquiescence." I was speaking of it, to a large extent, under the rubric of reliance. That is the extent to which in the period between Griggs and Ward's Cove the Congress had specifically in one fashion or another addressed this problem and had expressly chosen to leave the law as it understood it to be following the Griggs case.What we can say is that to the extent that the record shows that the Congress has not merely sat passively, as it were, in the aftermath of Griggs but has specifically addressed the question and has made choices to leave the law as it is, a record of that fact would, of course, present an even stronger argument for leaving the interpretation as it stood. And I don't know whether there are facts that could be adduced in this case or not.

YOU have a very strong argument for leaving the precedent as it is. I think the point that—and this has come up from time to time in cases when I was on the New Hampshire Supreme Court. I do not accept the position that never under any circumstances can a statutory interpretation be reexamined. I think "never" is a pretty strong word. But there is a very, very strong claim of precedent to be followed in those circumstances.

Well, except that I am not sure, as reviewing courts, we always have the luxury to consider that interpretation simply in a vacuum by itself. What I am trying to leave the door open for are situations in which, in fact, in the time, let's say, after the first decision the Congress itself has taken legislative action, which if not directly contradictory, is at least arguably inconsistent with the principle.If we get to a point on the issue of statutory interpretation where the earlier statutory interpretation has become a kind of isolated fluke, and we know that the Congress has, in fact, contributed to this process by its own subsequent legislation, then I think we ought to leave the door open for the fact that some coherence in the law would justify a reexamination of it.

I don't know one way or the other. That is right. 

OK. 

I won't touch that one, Senator. [Laughter.] 

I think the answer to that, Senator, is that to the extent to which the Court is perceived, reasonably perceived as acting as a superlegislature, to exactly the same extent the rules against getting into ultimate questions are going to weaken. You know, as you well know, the judgment about what is an appropriate question to ask, the judgment about what is an appropri-ate answer to that question, has ultimately got to be your judgment. The American people have their views. I have mine. But the responsibility for making that judgment rests on this committee. And I understand what you are saying.

My response to that, Senator, is that that does not raise, it seems to me—you raise a very serious issue, but you do not raise a justiciable issue. You are raising an issue of the self-definition of the Senate in relation to the President, and it is a matter which should not and cannot come before the Courts. 

I don't necessarily have that feeling as I sit here in the well of this room, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Sometimes they have to work at it, Senator. 

Thank you, sir. 

I won't forget this one. 

NO. I think it was not. 

NO, sir. 

I think that—I'm sure that is, yes. 

Well, I think by the use of the public funds or the use of the stores, in effect, as a forum, in effect, implicates a first amendment right. 

The State, in effect, had designated that as a forum, at least, for the collection of views, for expression; to that extent, yes. 

I think the appropriate place to go is to the legislature and as I think you kndw, that is where I went. 

They did in the instance of the 70-some-odd-thousand-dollar payment. Something was said earlier this morning about the possibility of a second one. I'm not aware that they made a second one, but I think $70,000 is a lot of money.

Yes. What I don't know offhand and certainly have forgotten is the proportion of protesters who were members of the Clam Shell Alliance and those who belonged to other affiliated organizations. But the Clam Shell Alliance was certainly the central organization, as I recall.

I was not aware that they were. That was the subject, I was reminded last week, that was the subject of a question to me in a deposition. To the best of my knowledge, no one in the attorney general's office was aware of any activity of that sort. I am not aware now what there was but nobody in the AG's office, I think, was aware of any activity of that sort until a year or more later.

NO; there was not. My understanding 

Well, it didn't occur to me to ask, I guess, any more than it would occur to me to ask in serious criminal cases whether they were using informants. My understanding is that what the State police officer was referring to was the use of members within the organization who would report to the State police. There was no wiretapping going on; there was no surveillance by police officers, as such. There was, apparently I gather from the response in the other deposition that you alluded to, that there was someone or some persons who were reporting to the State police on what the plans were. So that there was nothing that required the State police to get my permission, as for example, there would have been if there had been a wiretap involved or electronic eavesdropping. 

No. In fact, as I said a moment ago, the only thing that even to this day I thought they were referring to, in the period in question in the Seabrook demonstrations, was the passing on of information from somebody within the organization. But, in any event, I do not know of it.264 

Well, I don't know whether—I am taking that deposition just on its face; that's all I know and I guess just to be careful about what's in the deposition—I don't know whether anybody from my office discussed it, but if it was mentioned at that meeting, then he heard about it. 

Well, that private company did not become my client. The difficulty that has to be faced is there is a question raised. Hence, as I was saying in the discussion with Senator Metzenbaum, the appearance of justice is an independent value in its own right. 

Well, I hope it doesn't give the appearance of bribery. The appearance that I am concerned with is the appearance of influence. The fund, as I understand it, both what the Public Service Co. contributed and what other people around the country contributed in small contributions went into the general fund of the State so that there was no, I think, there was no question of anybody being bribed with the money. But the question that is properly raised with respect to the Public Service contribution is does it give the impression that theywere thereby in a position to exercise undue influence over what should be independent law enforcement decisions?

I do not recall ever discussing the subject with the Governor. As I said, the only recollection that I had which I mentioned last week was the—well, it wasn't, in fact, even a recollection—the only record that I found last week was on June 30 there was a reference in the minutes of the Governor and counsel that the acceptance of the funds had been proposed. I didn't otherwise recall the incident.

What I said was that if the law were called into question, in a lawsuit, that I would defend the law. Quite frankly, I think if we had reached the point, which we never did, I think probably I would have had to state to the court, that following Lemon, that the law couldn't be enforced.

That's correct. 

Well, I think it's not a matter of attitude, it's a matter of reflection and research. I think if, in fact, the law had been called in question and it had become incumbent upon me to file a brief with the court on the State's position, quite frankly, I don't think we could have found a defensible basis for it. I think we would have confessed constitutional error. I was ready to do everything I could to defend that or any State statute. But I think if we had gotten to that point, I think we would have to have admitted that there was a constitutional deficiency. 

I have no reason to say that the quote isn't accurate and I assume it is accurate, but the standard for any action by an attorney general and my standard was that I would uphold, I would act as an advocate to uphold State action if I could do so in good faith and without taking a frivolous position before the courts. I think when we had finally gotten through analysis and reflection I don't think we could have found a basis to uphold it and Ithink I would have been forced in that situation to say, no, we have got a constitutional defect here.

No. 

It would lead me to raise the question but it would not give me the answer. There are basically two other considerations. The first in this, as in any such case, is the claim of precedent. The second consideration which may fall, to a degree, under the claim of precedent, which is, at least, I think worth stating, stating separately, is whether, in fact, assuming that was the view of the Framers, the best way to affect it today is the way that the Court has, in fact, already taken.So that I do not regard the issue in this or in any other case as simply being a simple issue of what exactly was the original understanding because we are not being asked to adjudicate on a clean slate.

Yes, sir. 

AS I think I said, in any case, say now, I do not approach the Court with any inclination or agenda to do so. I will listen to that argument if it is made before me and I will listen respectfully as I would to any argument that is made before me. 

NO, I appreciate that. 

I think it would be better for me to say that I do not have the view, if I were to go on the Court, that that doctrineshould be changed. I am not approaching it with an inclination to upset the law in that respect.

Not a personal view. I have read the opinion in which that view was expressed. I have not done research on it myself, and I do not necessarily adopt it or reject it. I realize that it is there, and it has been put forward by some members of the Court.

Well, I think any such conclusion as that would make the claim of precedent an extremely crucial one. I mean, I think you are saying is, well, let's assume that we found that the establishment clause had a very narrow intended meaning. Do we ignore, essentially, the development of the law for the last 40

And as particularly embodied in the precedent which exists. 

Certainly. 

Given its recognition in the Constitution, I don't think we can start with that, no. 

That is correct. 

No. I think I could deal with those issues. 

Senator, may I just make one word? 

I don't mean in answering your question in the short way that I did to give any indication of the strength or weakness one way or the other of my feelings. What I mean to say is my feelings are such that I could still deal with those issues. 

That is right. And I think what I was referring to in the several cases that you have alluded to are situations in which judges recognize that their feelings are such that they simply cannot deal dispassionately with those issues or that they cannot do so without breaking their own moral codes. 

I don't ever recall being asked for legislative advice on that. I may very well have done it in the course of testimony, but I don't remember it. I do remember one specific instance in which the Governor discussed proposed action with me and asked for an opinion as to whether it was constitutional or not. I gave him an opinion, and I cannot break into the attorney/client privilege, but I can tell you that he took my advice on the subject. There were other instances—and these weren't during my tenure as attorney general, so they may be outside the scope of your question. You tell me if they are. But I can recall times during Mr. Rudman's tenure as attorney general when we were asked to give advice on that sort. The one that immediately comes to mind was the limits on permissible State action under the doctrine of Brandenburg v. Ohio. Advice on that score was requested by Governor Peterson, who was Governor I think in 1969, as he anticipated a visit of what was called the "Chicago Three"—those were three of the Chicago Seven—to speak at the University of New Hampshire, which was not universally popular. I worked on the memorandum which discussed the constitutional limits of State action in that case, and that advice was taken. 

Well, I have been careful not to endorse the specific holding of Griswold or its opinions, but I think I have been very clear in saying that I believe that there is a marital right toprivacy. And we have discussed some of the incidents at its core, including the reproductive right to determine whether or not to conceive a child as certainly being right at the center of it.

Well, it is clear to me. I think the only point at which I will quibble about the settled law is, as I think I said in one case last week, I suppose that everyone assumes that if there were a successful attack on Roe v. Wade, that would then call into question prior privacy cases. So I suppose one simply cannot say that it is settled in the sense that it is inconceivable that it could be challenged.

Well, with respect, sir, I think that is a question that I should not answer because I think to get into that kind of a comparison is to start down the road on an analysis of one of the strands of thought upon which the Roe v. Wade decision either would or would not stand. So, with respect, I will ask not to be asked to answer that.

Well, I have drawn a fine line on Griswold. I have said that I believe there is, in fact, a marital right to privacy which is at the core of any privacy doctrine. I have not endorsed the Griswold decision as such. It is a fine line to draw, Senator.

Yes, it is. 

With respect, I do not think I can answer that question.

There would be the obvious practical immediate political consequence that the issue would become a matter for legislative judgment in every State. I think it is safe to say that those legislative judgments would not be uniform. There would be, I daresay, a considerable variety in the scope of protection afforded or not afforded. The issue of federalism would be a complicated issue.

I appreciate that. Thank you. 

NO need to, sir. 

NO, I wish I could have said it that well. I think one of the points that I was trying to make this morning is that in deciding the degree of weight to be given to a longstanding statutory interpretation, we cannot make that decision without looking not only to the time which has elapsed since that first decision, but to what else both the legislature and the courts have been doing. And the vitality of an earlier interpretation depends in part upon its coherence with what has passed since that time. We simply cannot divorce that possibility from our thinking.

Well, in the civil law, for example, the rule on future interest recognizes the possibility of inheritance by an unborn child who is born alive and able to take. 

With respect, that is an issue which is capable of varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and I will be candid to say to you that I don't recall a specific decision on it in the law of New Hampshire, which is the jurisdiction I would be familiar with. 

Senator, I really cannot take up the task of reconciling that. As I said a moment ago, I am not sufficiently familiar with the specific body of civil law that you refer to, and the only thing I can say, as you know, is that Roe v. Wade is discussing a constitutional issue. One of the elements in the equation to which it speaks is the right of the mother. And the kind of inconsistency that you pose is, in fact, in the terms in which you pose it, an apparent reflection of weighting different interests of differential potential parties. But, beyond that, there really isn't anything I can say about reconciling it. 

Well, Senator, I think with respect that it is necessary for me to take the same position in response to your question that I have in response to the questions from some of your col-leagues; that a dissection of Roe v. Wade is simply a step, and a significant step, in the direction of an evaluation of that case which, in view of its likelihood in some form or another on the docket of the Supreme Court, if I were to be confirmed, is just a subject that I cannot discuss without giving misleading suggestions.

Again, in the abstract, we really can't answer that question. We have to know exactly what the context is. Weknow, for example, that in civil law corporations may be parties to litigation. We know that corporations can be defendants under the criminal law, and that probably is in your mind if you asked the question.

I regard myself as within the broad umbrella of interpretivism, and I have tried in response to a couple of questions to explain that the search that I am engaged on is a search for principle as opposed to specific intent when I approach a constitutional provision initially.

I said when I am approaching a constitutional provision, leaving aside entirely the question of precedent that may have accreted around it, what I am searching for is the meaning, which in most cases is a principle, intended to be established as opposed simply to the specific application that that particular provision was meant to have and that was in the minds of those who proposed and framed and adopted that provision in the first place.

Yes. 

I think the only thing that can be said, Senator, is we know that one distinction is drawn in the language of the first section. Whereas privileges or immunities refers to citizens only, the other guarantees refer to persons. And the issue that must come up and I think the issue that is implicated by your concern is whether that concept of person extends, as you have put it, to an unborn child.

Well, Senator, again, I think that is the kind of definitional issue that can only be discussed in the specifics of the kind of litigation which I cannot get into this afternoon. 

The case involves, really, two separate concepts. It involves the concept of federalism, and as Justice Kennedy's opinion pointed out very explicitly, it involved the question of whether, given the separation of powers as we recognize it, the judicial power can be construed to include the order in question, the inevitable result of which was that State officials raise taxes, so there is no question there is such an issue in the case. 

I think, again, that was a distinction which I know Justice Kennedy felt was a specious distinction.

NO doubt, of the case or its aftermath as the result of any congressional legislation is before the Court, that will be a distinct issue. 

Well, we have had several discussions on the problems which focused on 14th amendment enforcement. I think that has probably been the subject of our discussion on the matter up to this point. 

I think as far as I can go on that subject is what I have indicated so far, that, of course, I recognize that, as a simple matter of the text, the Constitution of the United States recognizes capital punishment. Beyond that, given the fact that there will be capital punishment cases before the Court and I believe are on its docket now, I do not think I can go very far on a discussion, without getting into something that is going to be before the Court. 

It does so by express preference. 

Well, I think where they begin is in the several textural references in the Constitution to the assumption that there are some rights not expressly enumerated. As I said to you, my thinking on the subject goes back to the State constitutions which form a preface to the National Constitution of 1787, including our own, with its recognition of unenumerated liberty interests. It includes the express reservation in the ninth amendment. As I said, I have found as a matter of our constitutional history that, given the other interpretations that have been placed or interpretations that have been placed on other sections of the provisions of section 1 of the 14th amendment, that the appropriate place to focus a question about the existence of a particular unenumerated right is with reference to the liberty clause of the 14th amendment or of the fifth amendment. What we have to find, what we are looking for, when we raise a question as to whether a given right is protected as fundamental liberty, is the kind of question on which I said I preferred the approach of the late Mr. Justice Harlan above all others, and that is we are making a search on his approach into the principles that may be elucidated by the history and tradition of the UnitedStates, and ultimately the kind of search that we are making is a search for the limits of governmental power, because it seems to me if there is one point that is clearly established by both State and National constitutional history, it is that the powers of the Government were not intended to be unlimited, that the grant of legislative power was intended to have limits, and those limits are reflected in the liberty concept.

Well, as I said, I think the first time the subject came up, I would not adopt as a kind of personal view any of the particular opinions in the Griswold case. My preference was for Justice Harlan's approach, rather than the approach that Justice Douglas embodied in the opinion that most members of the Court joined in.

Well, Senator, let me say two things: In the search for a content to the concept of privacy, we are not really looking for something new, as opposed to something which the constitutions assumed. We are looking for the principle that was intended to be recognized.The material on which we are going to base our conclusions is basically the corpus of material that we regard as reliable evidence about the understanding of the limits of State or, in appropriate cases, national power. Those limits in those materials include everything from things like Federalist Papers, debates, philosophical treatises of the times in question, which reflected a concept of limited power, and we certainly do not ignore the precedents of the Court that over the years have tried to treat with the subject.

Well, I guess I would use the term "care." The sound is of profound importance, it is not something that we are going to approach by winging it. We have to recognize that what we are searching for is a meaning which is independent of our personal predilections, and we have to guard against reading our predilections in what we find. I do not know of any other way to say, except that we would use great care in that enterprise, as we would in any interpretive enterprise on anything as of profound39-454—91 10and ultimate political importance to us as the meaning of the Constitution.

Well, I am not going to—as I said, I do not necessarily adopt the penumbral emanation terminology in my approach to things, but there is no question that, over the course of the next decade or decades, the scope of privacy will be explored in Court decisions, but we do not know until we have done the exploration. We cannot sit here with kind of an easy theoretical premise which is going to give us answers.

I appreciate that, sir. 

Contemporary. 

I think that is what I said. That is what I recall saying. 

Senator, I am afraid that I see that as really a question that cannot be answered, without throwing a suggestion on the Roe issue, and I will ask to pass on that. 

The Declaration is certainly one of the sources that we look for meaning on disputed issues. Some of the language, as you know, that is contained in the National Declaration oflnde-pendence is mirrored in our own State constitution, in its reference to rights which are not only inherent, but some of which are indeed inalienable.

There again, Senator, I think you have passed that point with me. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, I was referring to the rule that an unborn child may take a contingent remainder, if the child is born alive. That is what I was referring to. 

That an unborn child, a child who was unborn at the time a prior interest terminates may nonetheless take a remainder interest, if the child is born alive. 

Well, on the rule that I was referring to, the child must be born alive in order to ultimately take the remainder, and the question is the remainder will simply remain in abeyance until the law find whether a child comes along. 

That is right. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes, Senator. One of the issues that was raised by that case was whether—or the issue I guess that was raised by that case—was whether the defendant was bound by his own counsel's expression of approval, when the judge decided to excuse the juror.What happened in that case is what does happen from time to time, and that is between that moment and the moment at which the case was argued before us, the defendant had obtained new and different counsel and that counsel was then claiming that the defendant was not bound by his first lawyer's decision to accept the judge's determination that the juror should be excused.The issue that we had to confront in that case is whether to recognize that there are certain constitutional rights of a defendant, which are indeed so personal and fundamental that they may not be waived by someone on the defendant's behalf, that they would be exceptions to the general rule the defendant is bound by decisions of counsel, and we held in that case that the right of a trial by a full jury was indeed just such a right, and because the defendant had not on the record indicated a waiver of his right to 12, we reversed the conviction.

I believe that is right, yes. 

Yes, sir. 

Well, we decided on the basis of the New Hampshire Constitution, because the New Hampshire Constitution was extremely clear on the right to a 12-person jury. That was an issue which had been litigated in the past, I think around 20 to 25 years ago, prior to the time that we were writing. So that we were in a situation in which there was extant constitutional law in the State that was clear and explicit on one of the fundamental issues in the case. We took the position that where the State constitutional law was clear on a very significant issue, that it was appropriate to rest the decision on a State constitutional basis.

Well, my feelings are very strong on their value. I think I said earlier, when I was referring to some of the experiences that I had had as a trial judge, one of the best of those experiences was simply the continual exposure to jurors. I watched what they did in hundreds of cases. I talked with them after the cases were over. I left virtually every trial with an enormous respect for the jurors and the jury system.If there are two kinds of cases that I would emphasize that I found the jurors just indispensable in and dependable in, it was in criminal cases and in civil damage actions where the determination of an appropriate damage remedy was a reflection and should be a reflection of community standards.Let me just say a word about my feeling about the soundness of the jury system in criminal cases. I have heard lawyers, from time to time, wonder cynically whether, in fact, in front of a jury a defendant really does enjoy the presumption of innocence when that defendant does not take the stand and testify?One of the happy conclusions that I can report after presiding over hundreds of jury trials in criminal cases is that the answer to that question is, yes, juries do take that right seriously and they are, in my judgment, scrupulous and capable in following instructions.I had a number of instances, over the years, in which I would speak with jurors after a criminal case was over, in which jurors have said to me—cases in which there had an acquittal, in a criminal trial, and the defendant had not taken the stand—and I have had jurors say to me—I never ask jurors questions, by the way, about their views on the case—but they would often volunteer them, and they would say to me, Judge, we thought the defendant was guilty but not beyond a reasonable doubt. We weren't that sure.Those were cases in which the defendant had not taken the stand. I came away with an unbounded respect for the jury system in those circumstances.I think if I were giving advice to any party, in any case and certainly to a criminal defendant in a criminal case, my advice would be, at least in the State I'm familiar with, you may depend upon the jury's good faith in applying the instruction on the presumption of innocence even if you do not testify. But the one thing you must not do is take the stand and lie because jurors have an extraordinary capacity to perceive untruth.That is advice that I would never hesitate to give. When you have had the kind of experiences that I'm alluding to there, you come away a great champion of the jury system.

Well, Senator, I'm going to have to make a confession. I remember the case of Richard v. McCaskell and I remember the circumstances from which it arose, but I did not reread that case in the last couple of weeks and I'm shaky on it. Could I look at the opinion when we take a break and perhaps address your question afterward?

My recollection is that in that case the police officer was in the grand jury room contrary to the instructions of the Court. No issue was raised, as I recall in the case, that the police officer had acted in any affirmatively inappropriate way. The question was, whether the integrity of the grand jury system was best served by quashing an indictment with respect to which there was no indication of prejudice to the defendant, or whether the grand jury system was best preserved by, in effect, requiring the Court to enforce its own orders, and to keep tabs on what was going on in the grand jury room. My view was that in the absence of any indication of prejudice by misconduct by the police officer that the social balance was best served not by quashing an otherwise valid indictment, but by depending no the trial court's authority over its own proceedings, including the conduct of grand jury proceedings, to police the grand jury room in that way. 

Yes, sir. 

I do. That is or was a function of the Supreme Court that I was most reluctant to undertake. There was no question that I had a constitutional duty to do it, and I did so. But the faults of the system are exactly as you describe them. We are asked to give opinions on subjects where we have no benefit of any factual record. I don't know how it works in your own State, Senator, but in mine it is rare, and perhaps—I'm not sure it has ever happened in my experience—that we have oral arguments in those cases. They are submitted on the basis of memorandums, and frequently it's the case that we are faced with the constitutional duty to give an advisory opinion in which one side of an issue is not even represented by memorandums, and let alone, resting on a factual record which is necessary to sharpen any issue. So we find ourselves giving opinions and we do it sort of with our hearts beating fast because the fact is we need the help of oral advocacy. Courts do not do well or would not do well to sit by themselves and decide cases without the help of lawyers, and indeed of pro se parties, and we don't have that kind of help in any systematic way in those advisory opinions. If you were going to poll, I think, the New Hampshire judiciary on the article of the Constitution they were most likely to amend, that one would win. 

Well, the distinction turned, well, the issue arose on the question, whether there was, in fact, a legitimate State interest which would justify the legislative decision made in that case. The reason the court drew the distinction that it did, saying that the prohibition against the operation of daycare centers would not pass constitutional muster, but that the prohibition on adoption would, turned on their being an evidentiary basis for the legislature to hold that there was a role model function served by adoptive parents, but conversely that we did not see that there was a strong argument or an indication of evidence that the same thing could be said with respect to those who operated daycare centers. In fact, as the bill was written—a daycare—an individual would be prohibited from operating a daycare center even if there were no contact between the individual and the children, and we found that that was just outrageously too broad. There is no question that I think that case probably illustrates one of the difficulties inherent in any advisory opinion of the sort that we've been talking about, and that is we did not have, as a record behind us, a developed evidentiary record on the role model theory. The most that we could say is, yes, there were thinkers and child psychologists who believed that that was, in fact, a proper analysis. We realized that it was a disputed point, but we believed it was within the legislative power to make a judgment on that. But there is no question that in that case, as in many others, we might have had a very different record if we had had an actualpiece of litigation coming to us, instead of an advisory opinion request.

Well, I do, without question. As you know, Senator, the threats to the State judiciary, to the independence of the judiciary are less probably in an injunctive situation than they would be in a situation in which monetary fines could be recovered and monetary damages could be recovered. There is great concern throughout the country about the susceptibility of actions to monetary awards based on actions by the courts which are administrative in nature as opposed to the exercise of core judicial functions.The judges, in the aftermath of those decisions, have had to exercise great care in trying to draw the lines between what they deem as the exercise of a core judicial function, as opposed to administrative functions. But there is no question that there is a threat which is felt. Whether ultimately that threat is justifiable or not I suppose is an issue that could, indeed, come before the Court again in my time, but I understand the argument on the side that you refer to.

Yes. 

What led us to that belief, Senator, was the fact that the people of New Hampshire had already amended the New Hampshire Constitution to provide that in cases in which there had been a commitment based on what we generally call insanity arising out of a criminal case, the burden of proof would be clear and convincing. Now, that constitutional provision was adopted in the train of a series of New Hampshire decisions going back before the time thatI was on the supreme court, in which the court had held that, both with respect to commitments based on mental illness and dangerous propensity arising out of purely civil proceedings and the same kinds of commitments arising out of criminal proceedings, the standard of proof required for the State to prove the probability of dangerousness, if the subject were allowed to go at large, would be the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.In those prior cases, the court had taken pains basically to say that although the proceedings from which these commitments arise are different kinds of proceedings—one is criminal, one is civil— the justification for State action is essentially the same in each case. It is a concern with safety, both for the public and for the individual committed.What those prior cases had done, in effect, was to put the civil and the commitment cases on the same footing so far as the factual and, in fact, constitutional justification for commitment. When, therefore, the New Hampshire electorate amended the constitution to provide that in cases arising out of criminal proceedings, the standard would be reduced to clear and convincing—when, in effect, they overruled the New Hampshire Supreme Court with respect to the criminal commitment cases—it was necessary to follow the same rule with respect to the civil commitment cases because in each case the justification was the same. It was a kind of selfpolicing of equal protection, in a way. And so, therefore, we believed that we were compelled to adopt the—in effect, to take the constitutional change in the criminal area as a mandate to change the standard in the civil area as well. It, in fact, was probably inadvertence that the drafters of the constitutional amendment had not expressly referred to both. But, in any case, we had a very simple question of evenhandedness.

Well, Senator, I have never done any research on the question of whether it could be limited. I have tended to assume that it would not be if it was called. And I would not in my present position give advice to the Congress or to the Nation about what they should do. But it is instructive to remember on the assumption that I have made that when the Convention of 1787 was called, its charge was to revise the Articles of Confederation. And we all know what happened. That was a magnificent departurefrom the intent of the Convention. Whether we could expect such happy results another time is a question I think everybody had better face.

No, it is not that I got tired or took up another activity. I would like to think that I probably got a little bit more persuasive with my colleagues in conference. [Laughter.] 

Senator, I would recognize that I was not sitting there with the power to revise the decision of Congress; and that the only power that I was sitting there with was the judicial power; and I would look to the Constitution of the United States.

I believe I have done the best I could, and I think I have done reasonably well. One is never perfect.

Yes, sir. 

We try and we work at it. 

I don't know how you press a legislative body. I think you do it with the same respectful assumption that you would like to be given by the legislative body itself. That is the assumption that when an obligation to act is clear, people who have taken the oaths that we all take will follow them and will act. And289 I think probably I would not regard it as my business to lecture so much as my business to record that in a given instance I think the appropriate time to act is there. And I would, beyond that, rest on the sense of obligation of the legislative branch itself.

It is certainly the judicial aspiration. I admit that I have read some opinions of my own sometimes, and I have wondered just how much guidance they gave. But that is our aspiration, and it is an aspiration to a very respectful guidance. We are not there to tell legislators how to legislate, but we are there as judges, whatever the court may be, to try to tell legislators and the rest of the State and the rest of the Nation, as best we can and as comprehensively as we can, what we believe the law to be.

Well, I have had cases of my own in the past in which I have called the legislature's attention to what seemed to me an unresolved statutory problem which the case before us touched upon but which didn't require a solution. The effect of opinions like that is to direct the legislature's attention. But I think what the court has to be very careful about—again, whatever the court may be—is in observing the line between doing that, crossing over the line and start laying out substantive options, because then I think we are beginning to tread into the legislative arena. You can't lay out options very well without somebody thinking that you are winking on one of them. And that is where we have to draw the line.

I would try to respond, I would try to make that kind of a suggestion, so long as it did not cross that line, in effect saying to Congress what it is that Congress ought to do. I think the courts can address the fact that there is a problem without trying to tell the legislature how it ought to solve that problem. 

I think the only way it can balance it is simply by keeping in mind that there are constitutional values ultimately to be served and constitutional limits ultimately to be respected. And I will not this afternoon personally adopt the Federalist language on that point, but I will say that for anyone who shared that concern, Marbury v. Madison is a happy answer because, by and large, at least there is a judicial reviewability on the question of constitutionality, and it is our obligation to make sure that that, in fact, is the extent of the scope of review. 

I hope you are not going to ask me to define all of those. 

Well, the answer is relative, but I think probably I would sum it up by saying that I have learned something about the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin's advice. When he was addressing the Constitutional Convention and asking them to accept the draft, he said, if I remember him well, he said, "Join with me for a moment in doubting a bit your own infallibility."Well, I have learned to do that. 

"Join with me in doubting for a minute your own infallibility."

Thank you, Senator. 

I have. I don't have an itinerary to lay out, and I know that that is not what you were expecting me to do. But the one thing that was so clear to me when I was thinking about your question afterward is what you yourself suggested when you asked it. You said in so many words that when you had come to the Senate, you didn't know what those things are that would be sort of the objects of your own growth. But suddenly you were presented with them, and it was clear to you that there were blank spaces in your life which you had never concentrated on before. And once you knew that, it was obvious how to go about filling them. I have had that same experience. I never knew when I started practicing law what I was going to see as problems in society that would occupy a great deal of my time, but suddenly they were there. And without any expectation, you knew what you needed to know or you knew what you didn't know and what you should concentrate on. I have no doubt that if I should go on the Supreme Court, the stimulation of my colleagues and perhaps even more importantly the stimulation of the issues and the cases that come before us will make the path of what I think I would call an organic growth as clear to me as it has been to you. That is the way my life hasworked up to this time, and I have no doubt that it is going to continue.The one thing I do know from just my experience on the New Hampshire Supreme Court is that one of the fears that we really do have to fear is the fear of isolation, which the disciplines of the judicial power force upon us. And we have to be constantly aware that we cannot seal ourselves away.

Well, it is. You know, you refer in a way—you speak of the country. It is only natural when you have been a State court judge to have that kind of sense of your State as a whole. You know where all the diversity fits in it. And I would assume and hope and expect that the kind of same imperative within ourselves would apply if in your judgment I should face a national jurisdiction.

AS part of the remedial power, yes. 

Yes, to a degree. One of the things that it was difficult for me to understand—this is one of the subjects of my own growth, this is really a growth question, I think, that you asked me—is the entrenchment and the commitment in places other than the places where I lived to the perpetuation of a discriminatory and unjust system. I had grown up, as you know, in an atmosphere in which the kind of institutionalized discrimination that was of concern to us in those days did not exist on my street or in my town, and you neverreally do face those facts of human nature until they are forced in front of you, and they were forced in front of all of us then.I remember the—I suppose no one in New Hampshire could forget it, but I remember if there was ever one thing that brought that home to us, it was when a boy from Keene, named Jonathan Daniels, was killed one summer, when he had gone I think to Mississippi on a voter registration drive, and suddenly we realized, in the most particularized way, what the Nation faced, and I think we could not have realized it before that time.

Going back to the news account that you referred to, Edward DeCorsi is a person for whom I have unbounded respect, and I appreciated his reference to me in his column.295 The only thing that I might question and would question is the possibility of having left the suggestion that in respect to these three subjects, Congress had no constitutional power. Congress does have constitutional power in it. I know what was on my mind back at that time 12 years ago, and it was pretty well suggested by the remainder of the quote that you referred to, and that was that, because we on the local level simply are not able or willing to face the problems that are in front of us, those problems, in fact, will be faced by someone else and our control, our ability to kind of do our best at home, perhaps with the least amount of money, is simply an ability which we are allowing to be taken away from ourselves, because if we will not solve our problems, Congress will and Congress should. I am afraid that that rule, if you will, that rule of dwindling responsibility is just as good a rule today as it was back when I first spoke of it. 

I stayed away from that word, believe me. [Laughter.] 

The second one, because I would rather have the right to do something than a right to stop somebody else from doing something. 

I am not ready to agree with that. I do not think the—I know the criticism that is being made and I know that Congress has been very well made aware of its power, as we were saying earlier, under section 5 of the 14th amendment, but I would simply be reluctant, on the basis of the evidence that is in at this point, to say that the Supreme Court is trying to wash its hands of protection. I trust that is a day we will not see. 

I think the Nation is served well by seeing me and by seeing you. Naturally, not every moment in this process has been totally much to my liking as some, but what I am appreciative of is in being part of a process and a visible one. You are right, the afternoon, it is afternoon and I have been sitting here for a while and I will be here for good while longer, and perhaps I will be back tomorrow, but the fatigue at the hour has nothing to do with the value of the process and I am glad that you have had me here.

NO, because the committee has been very respectful, even in cases in which it may not have agreed about the point at which it has seemed to me necessary to limit my answers for the sake of the integrity of the judicial process, and I have been grateful for that respect.

I would like that, even if I do not go to the Supreme Court.

Well, as you know, Senator, I do come from a tradition that involves Senator Rudman, and it is a tradition that goes back to the days in New Hampshire when Senator Rudman was establishing a consumer division in the State of New Hampshire, with jurisdiction over the State antitrust laws and was bringing about the passage of a Consumer Protection Act, which I later, as attorney general, had the responsibility to administer. I also have been well educated by Senator Rudman over the years in the value of small business. Small business has no better friend than he has, and I think one of the lessons that I have ab-297 sorbed from a long period of my professional lifetime with him, if I needed to absorb that from anyone else, is the importance of a degree of competition which will allow small business to emerge and allow for diversity in the American economy, which it is the object of the antitrust laws to secure, as much as that is possible.

There is simply no question about it, either as an historical matter or as a strictly legal matter, as one examines the precedents. The ultimate object of the system, it seems to me, has to be judged on its systemwide effects. I do not think the antitrust laws should even be seen as merely consumer laws or as antibusiness laws, but as laws intended to assure a free and open and competitive economic system for everyone.

Well, I know I was attorney General at the time of Illinois Brick, and so perhaps my reactions go back to those days. By the same token, I suppose I should be weary of making predictions about who is an appropriate plaintiff in an antitrust action, because issues of that sort are going to be before me.I think the most that I can say is that I do remember the days of Illinois Brick and I remember when that decision first came down, and I think you may safely assume that I am sensitive to the concerns that you have just alluded to.

Well, I am afraid we would be ships without anchors, if we tried to do that. In perhaps the more garden variety cases of statutory interpretation, we are used to looking to legislative intent to resolve questions of ambiguity and vagueness, when the statute is not clear on its face.But when we are dealing with the antitrust laws, we are dealing with one of the most spectacular examples of delegation to the judiciary that our legal system knows, and if that delegation is not going to be, as it were, sort of a delegation of totally free choice to the judiciary, certainly a respect for the legislative intent has got to be our anchor in interpretation.

Well, I do not start with that presumption. To begin with, of course, with the repeal of the fair trade laws, Congress has indicated its more plenary acceptance of Dr. Miles than was true before, so I think we have an expression of congressional philosophy on the issue.It is perfectly true that, in theory, any manufacturer could also be his own distributor and run his own retail outlets, in which case the price-fixing issue would not arise, but that does not seem to me to be a basis for saying that it should not arise in the economic world in which we live.I will be candid to say that I do not set myself up as an expert in antitrust matters, as much as I think in some other fields of constitutional law or in statutory law, in which I have a greater background, and I am certainly going to be willing in an appropriate case to consider the economic testimony in determining what cases should be adjudicated on rule of reason basis and what should not.But I certainly cannot start with the assumption that, in fact, there should be no restraint, no limitation on vertical restraint because it seems to me, as I said, that the congressional expression of policy is otherwise.

Well, of course, as you know, Senator, we are familiar under title VII with the discriminatory impact concept. And I think the best respond to your question is that it is an obviously inappropriate concept for Congress to adopt, and we will administer it.

Well, I have a weakness for history in my reading. I think oddly enough—and it wasn't planned with this appearance in Washington in mind, but I think the last two history books that I read were Joseph Lash's book on the New Deal, "Dreamers and Dealers," and Katie Lockheim's book on "The Making of the New Deal." And I didn't realize I would be in Washington quite so soon after I read those books.I have gone through sort of periods of reading kicks in both American and English history, too. I can remember there have been a couple of summers which I have just sort of set aside and really bored through things. So there is an awful lot of history books on my shelves. Unfortunately, the trouble that I find, as I have spent more and more time on the bench, or at least more and more time in judicial writing, more and more books don't get on read, do not get read. So if the day ever comes that I retire, I am going to have one of the most magnificent unread libraries in New Hampshire. The stuff is all sitting there. And the only consolation I have got is I was reading a life of Lord Melbourne, Philip Ziegler's book on Lord Melbourne a couple of years ago, and he said Melbourne had that problem. He just couldn't stop buying books, and they piled up, and he didn't have time to read them. And Ziegler said that, "Defensively, Melbourne became a believer in the osmotic power of literature to seep through." So I can only hope that he is right.As I said, I probably read more history than anything else, but I go on novel kicks. I went through a period in which I read everything of Faulkner's, everything of Fitzgerald's. I haven't read everything of Hemingway's. That is one of the things that is sort of there in abeyance.And then I read sort of whimsically unrelated stuff. My law clerks from time to time think I lead too sheltered a literary life. One of them got me to read "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" a little while ago. [Laughter.]So there are some wild cards on the book list. 

Thank you, sir. 

Yes, the principle being you have got to prove your harm, and the burden of proof is the highest known in our constitutional law.

I think that level of protection reflects the significance of the libel laws in modern society. I take that decision as a judgment by the Court that that was the only appropriate way to effect the freedom of the press, given the economies of the modern society that the first amendment protects. And I have no reason to gainsay that or second-guess it.

Yes, I have no reason to call them into question. And as I think you may recall from my answer to one of your colleagues today, I have been in the position of giving advice to the executive branch on the implementation of Brandenburg.

We had three. 

Yes, they did. There is one subchapter of that story which I wasn't personally involved in and on which I am a little vague. But, apparently, as I recall it best, late in the day when they were going to speak, some concerns with an evidentiary basis were raised about security, and my best recollection is that both the State and the sponsors of the speech and the speakers ended up before the U.S. district court. And I think the judge of the U.S. district court actually issued an order restricting the time within which the speech should be given for some security reason that I do not now recall. But they did speak. 

That is correct. 

Yes, and I mentioned that when I speak of original intent, or the intentionalist school, I am talking particularly about that view that the meaning of the provision or the application of the provision should somehow be confined to those specific instances or problems which were in the minds of those who adopted and ratified the provision, and that the provision should be applied only to those instances or problems. I do not accept that view. 

I think the best way—you know this is one of those difficult issues to talk about only because as you, yourself, suggested at the beginning, it is difficult to state the problem the way we want to. I think the best way to describe it is this way. Principles don't change, but our perceptions of the world around us and the need for those principles do. I wonder if we do not have, as a good example, and I know we keep coming back to this, but I wonder if we don't have, as an example of how this evolution takes place in Brown v. Board, itself? 

The majority who decided Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 accepted as a matter of fact that in the context in which they were applying the 14th amendment there could be separateness and equality. Whatever else we may see in Brown v. Board, there is one thing that we see very clearly and that is that the Court was saying you may no longer in applying this separate but equal doctrine, ignore the evidence of non-tangible effects. When you accept that evidence, then you see that you cannot have separateness and equality. In 1954 they saw something which they did not see in 1896. Now I will say, as I have said before, that I think Plessy was wrongly decided, but I also understand that there was a perception which the experience of 58 years had allowed the Court in 1954 to make and they saw an application for a principle which was not seen in 1896, and they saw the factual impossibility of applying the terms of 1896 in 1954. I would like to think, and I do believe, that the principle of equal protection was there and that in the time intervening we have gotten better at seeing what is before our noses. 

Yes. 

I want to say 1964. 

I think that is a fair statement. As I said to you when we were talking in kind of a short-handed way earlier today, the hurdle in Baker was the argument which Justice Harlan raised. One cannot deny the power of Justice Harlan's argument, that section 2 of the 14th amendment indicated an intent not to apply the principle to the situation at hand. As I said, without underestimating the power of that argument, if I had been on the Court, it seems to me that ultimately I would have had to have rejected it. But once that hurdle was passed, then the principle of equal protection or the applicability of it, it seems to me was reasonably clear. 

I am sorry. 

That is correct and it's also the case that I suppose there is no provision in the original Bill of Rights that has been sort of any more modified in its understanding than that one has been. We recognize that as a starting point.

Well, I think there are two things. 

I'm sorry. I think there are two things to be said about that. The first is going back to the time of Holmes. Holmes said, look, it is too late in the day for us to take a strictly originalist view—he did not use the term originalist view—of the due process clause. He said there is, at the very least, or there is a substantive component to due process. He would have or did express it in terms of the principle that the State must demonstrate a rational relationship between the substance of what it legislates and the obtainment of a legitimate governmental object. Holmes said that is something other than pure procedure and we accept the fact that that is the way the clause is being interpreted. We don't turn the clock back. We accept it. So do we all. So do I.The second thing that to me is interesting about Boiling and trying to find the correct application with the principle starting, let's say starting at the Holmes point, is that Boiling is so often described as a case which held that due process has an equal protection component. In point of fact, that description of Boiling came later. What Boiling was doing was, in the first instance—as you said a minute ago let us all be realists—in the first instance, the Court was saying, look we can't have Brown here and do nothing about the question of segregation in the public schools.What the Court did in Boiling was not simply to say, look, all along there was an equal protection component in due process. They said something very different. They went through a kind of fairness analysis and ultimately I have always read Boiling as coming down to this question. We are going to apply to segregation in the Washington, DC schools the old kind of, the accepted kind of substantive due process analysis that even the conservatives accept. We are going to say is there, at the present time, a legitimate governmental object which is being served by this particular restriction, that is, the restriction on total freedom to attend schools in an integrated basis?The most interesting thing about Boiling is that the Court said, no, that is not a legitimate governmental objective. Hence, the Court solved the problem of segregation not by pretending that due process simply means equal protection but we never noticed it before. They solved it by doing a kind of due process analysis. They said there is no legitimate governmental objective to be served here.I have sometimes taken, in my own mind I have taken Boiling as an example of a general rule that I sometimes invoke and that is a lot of equal protection cases don't have to be equal protection cases. If somebody is being discriminated against on first amendment rights, why don't you go right to the first amendment? Don't worryabout equal protection. Say is there any justification for restricting this person's first amendment right?Well, something like that was going on in Boiling v. Sharpe. As you know, subsequently that has been kind of transformed in a way and has been put in this short-handed way saying, oh, well, Boiling v. Sharpe says there is an equal protection component and that is the accepted view today, but the Court, I think, was more subtle than that in Boiling.

I don't believe that judgment would have been regarded as correct, and it would not have been rendered at that time.

I am sorry, the 1964 judgment?

I accept the 1964 judgment as correct. Whether I would have been as prescient in the 19th Century as I think I am post-1964 is something I will make no claim to.

Sure. 

I know. 

Yes, and we understand the significance of facts that bear on it in a way which we or our predecessors did not understand a century before. Dionne—well, this is beside the point. I was going to say Dionne is a slightly, I suppose— 

Of course, it is. 

I think that is a good way of putting it. 

I think there is only on comment to make, Senator—maybe there are two. The first is a personal one. I have made it before, but I think I should make it to you, too, that I appreciate what you said a moment ago about the fact that we cannot, by legislation, erase all discrimination in our society, but we can try. We can go as far as we can.In this process, there is no question that when a legitimate issue of the scope of protection or the scope of remedy arises, that it is indeed the intent of Congress, which is the touchstone for determining what the results should be, not a crabbed intent or, on the other hand, a speculative inquiry, but a fair reading of Congress' intent placed on the record, and if I am in the position to do it, I will engage in that process.

I think, as I understand your question, you are asking can anything but a free choice system, in fact, be enforced, a right to choose is anything but a right to choose system, as a practical matter, enforceable in this country, and the fact is I do not know the extent of its enforceability, but I recognize the problem that you raise by your suggestion.

I do not suppose, Senator, that there is any more moving example of the application of what I did try to say the other day, that whatever the Court does, someone's lives, and indeed thousands of lives, will be affected, and that fact must be appreciated.

Thank you, Sir. 

Thank you, sir. 

Yes. 

Yes, sir. 

We followed it because we agreed with it. The case in Valenzuela, and that is the way I pronounce it too, was a case which was—or an issue in this respect that was raised under the State constitution because the defendants who raised the issue knew that Smith had been decided, so that so far as their Federal grounds were concerned they realized that they did not have any possibility of obtaining relief. The peculiar aspect of the Valenzuela case was that in raising the issue under the State constitution of whether or not a pen register recording was a search, they made the assumption that the New Hampshire Supreme Court had accepted as its sort of framework for analyzing search and seizure problems the same basic premise that the U.S. Supreme Court had adopted in Katz v. United States, which was the reasonable expectation of privacy theory. In point of fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court had never adopted that theory as its kind of unifying search and seizure theory. But, in any event, there being no disagreement, we simply took the case on the assumption that assuming arguendo that a Katz reasonable expectation of privacy analysis is going to apply, is there any good reason to come out differently under the State constitution on that theory from the way that the U.S. Supreme Court did under the fourth amendment on Smith v. Maryland? 

Well, I don't know whether we could have reasonably or correctly done that, but the issue is, in theory, open in New Hampshire, so that I suppose that as a theoretical possibility, yes. Whether it would be a sound decision when and if the Court reaches it is not something I would make any suggestion on, but in theory, yes.

I think I would draw this distinction, Senator: the supremacy clause would not require us to construe the State constitution as broadly, but if we construed it in a way that, in fact, afforded less right to a defendant, the New Hampshire Constitution would, in that respect, be inoperable because under the supremacy clause the fourth amendment standard would always be the one that would apply and would govern.

I have not reread it, but my recollection is that Justice Black said when you are trying to carry the fourth amendment to intangibles like conversations you are carrying it beyond its terms. Justice Black was a very strict textualist, and my recollection is that was the basis for his decision in that case, although I have not read it in a long time.

Well, Justice Black was saying that you cannot have a search without some tangible to be seized. I guess I do not think that is a self-evident proposition.

Well, we didn't agree with it, but we were not asked to agree with it. The issue was not placed before us.

I picked it out simply because we were signaling the bar of the fact that a unifying principle in a decision that would indicate the ultimate scope of the article had never been rendered, and we simply said that when and if the time comes that the Court is asked to adopt, let's say, the reasonable expectation ofprivacy analysis, there are competing views. Therefore, those views are going to have to be considered before we make a decision.But there was no intention there to indicate that the Court was likely to agree with Justice Black or to go in any particular direction.

I was going to say that I think there was nothing in the opinion that was meant to indicate that the Court was likely to agree with Justice Black and to go in his direction if the issue was raised. We simply said that the issue has never been raised and there is disagreement about it.

Well, as I said, I haven't reread it before coming in here, but I don't necessarily accept the proposition that you can't have a regulated search without an intangible to be seized. That was Justice Black's premise.

Yes, if you found an interest subject to potential protection. As you know, in the Eisenstadt case, because it was an equal protection case, the Court did not go through the kind of due process analysis that would inform sort of your first premise there, and I have not gone through it, either.

The case has not been decided. Senator Leahy [continuing]. Aside, the State could ban the sale of contraceptives to unmarried adults? Judge SOUTER. The case has not been decided and the privacy analysis that would be its first step simply has not been done. I have not done it and the Supreme Court of the United States has not done it. That is an open question. Eisenstadt, as I recall, and I think I said before, I did not reread Eisenstadt before coming in here and I wish I had, but my recollection is that Eisenstadt went on straight equal protection grounds. I could be wrong on that, but I thought it did.

Yes. 

Without getting into a long analysis, anything that I could conceivably say could conceivably read as an indication of not only what that advice was, but what I was being asked to address, and I think that would be unfair to the student involved. I think the possible answers to that question could be a revelation of some of the things that the student may have said to me and I think that would be wrong for me to reveal.

Well, I do not know whether that is so or not. 

Thank you, sir. 

Senator, I have been so short of time on the Federal bench that I really have not, although I have made one observation and I think it may be much more specific than you had in mind, but I will pass it on for what it is worth.I know that I have been living in temporary chambers since I went on the court of appeals, the temporary chambers are in the U.S. District Courthouse in Concord, NH. I was talking one day with the clerk of that court, who told me that his criminal caseload had increased I think threefold or fourfold in the past, oh, 12 to 18 months. I said why is that, and he said as a result of the drug prosecutions. He said what I have been telling counsel is that you are coming down in volume, you are coming down a 4-lane highway and then you are going to get to the U.S. district courtroom and it is not a 4-lane highway, because there are not enough judges here to absorb that kind of increase, as a result of the prosecutorial ac-tivity, and the expectation is that there is going to be a very serious administrative problem in handling the volume of cases.What I hope will not happen is what I have been seeing happen on the State level, and I alluded to it the other day, and that is that the demand, the constitutional imperative for the trial of criminal cases in a speedy fashion is squeezing the civil caseload off the dockets of those courts. And if they stay off the dockets long enough, we are going to see, and we are in fact seeing now, the development of an alternative and private system of civil justice in this country.And while there may be some people—there are undoubtedly are some people who will say fine, if that can simply be passed on to the private sector, let the private sector pick it up and operate it on an entrepreneurial basis, but the price that will be paid for that is that, in my judgment, part of the glue that holds us together as well as we do as a society is the fact of a common system of justice, criminal and civil, and if that common system is lost, then I believe part of the coherence of American society will be lost, too, and I hope that is not what we are going to see down the road.

I will, sir. 

Yes. Judge HEFLIN [continuing]. It was a case where a person was being tried for the fraudulent use of a credit card and entered a nolo contendere plea, and later it was challenged by habeas corpus proceedings and, as a result, the issue came as to whether or not there had been a waiver. Would you explain that case and your reasoning in reaching the decision?321 Judge SOUTER. Yes. Thank you, Senator, I did refresh my recollection of that during the break. Richard v. McCaskell was a State habeas corpus case. The facts were that the defendant or the petitioner, actually, had been convicted of fraudulent use of a credit card or shoplifting, on a previous occasion had entered a plea of nolo contendere and had been given a suspended sentence. She had then been arrested and charged against, and when she was found guilty of a second offense, the district court brought forward the first conviction and the suspended sentence and moved to impose that sentence. She then challenged the validity of the sentence in the first case by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus, and her claim was that she had not entered a valid waiver of her rights to trial at the time she entered the nolo contendere plea in the first case. What her request for relief turned on was the need for courts to make a record of the waivers of rights which are implicated by a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. In the absence of a record of such a waiver, the burden is on the State to prove affirmatively that the waiver in the first case was, in fact, a voluntary waiver. Whereas, conversely, if there is an adequate record that the defendant did waive the rights knowingly and intelligently, the burden would be on the petitioner to prove that, in fact, the plea in the first instance was not a voluntary one. In this case, there was no such record indicating that the court had canvassed the defendant and had obtained from her a personal knowing and intelligent waiver of rights, and, therefore, the court held, in the opinion that I wrote, that it had been error for the trial court in this case to dismiss the petition for the writ. Now, the State claimed that it could present evidence that there had been, in fact, a voluntary and knowing waiver, but we held that there was no evidence on the record before us from which the trial court could have found that, and we therefore vacated the trial court's order dismissing the write and remanded it. So, to sum it up, it was as case that recognized that when there is not an adequate record of a waiver of these very fundamental and personal rights which must precede the entry of anything but a plea of not guilty, the burden is on the State to prove that there was such a waiver and, without such proof, the defendant would be entitled to withdraw the plea. 

I only remember that there was a speedy trial issue in that case and that we found that the speedy trial right had not been infringed, but, quite frankly, I do not remember the facts in sufficient detail to know exactly how we analyzed it. 

Yes. 

I hope they will never be regarded as mutually exclusive. 

Close in time, yes. 

Yes, sir. 

I would be willing to go on testifying. Thank you very much.

Because that case struck me as a classic exampleof the kind of case in which there has got to be an opportunity forreliance upon what the court does. We were dealing in that casewith the issuance of insurance policies. We have obligations to bothparties to those policies to come up with a coherent body of lawwhich can be understood and which those parties can rely upon inmaking their business arrangements.We simply cannot go back and forth in cases of that sort everycouple of years, and, therefore, I believed we were in a situation inwhich the demand for a reasonable reliance certainly outweighedmy concern to go back and sort of rewrite the history of NewHampshire precedent in the way that I would have done, if I hadbeen able to do that in the first place.

With respect, Senator, I am going to ask not toanswer the application to Roe v. Wade, but I can certainly tell youthat the issue of reliance is not an issue which is limited to com-mercial cases.

Yes, sir.

Well, of course, the most prominent feature ofthat case was that it was a statutory construction case and I be-lieved that if, in fact, the legislature had disagreed with the statu-tory construction that the court placed on it, as erroneous as Ithought it was—of course, any judge who ever gets overruled islikely to think that the case that overrules him is erroneous, but I really thought it was in that case—I believe that if the legislature had any disagreement with the court's construction, it would have amended the statute. It had not done so.I also believed, as I said there, that the consequences of the erroneous ruling were not of cosmic significance, so that it was perhaps an easy case in which to follow stare decisis.

I do not. I have never done the research, but I do not.

SO far as the issue raised in Roe v. Wade is concerned, the answer to that is correct. Whether there is any basis that could be raised in different litigation, a different claim, based on the rights of the fetus, rather than on the rights of the mother, that, of course, is a totally undecided issue.

Yes, if we assume that the subject matter of the rights are the same in each case, whichever gives the greater protection is the one that will prevail.

I would prefer not to comment on it, sir. 

Yes. 

The reason I took the position that I did was that I felt the way the majority opinion had been written, that it was inevitable that this question was raised, and my position was to note that, in fact, the possibility that I pointed out was indeed not foreclosed by the court's decision.It seemed to me that if we said absolutely nothing on the subject, we had, as a court, raised a moral dilemma and that it was a moral dilemma that was inherent in the effect of our decision and that we should at least point out that there was nothing in our decision which foreclosed the particular course of action that I mentioned in my concurrence as a means of responding to that moral dilemma.So, I guess the answer boils down to this: It is not that it was an issue that was expressly raised, but it was an issue which seemed to me inherent in the way the court had decided the case and we ought at least to say something about it.

Well, there is really an—I will not say an alternative, there is a complimentary principle that we frequently point out, issues which we are reserving or not deciding, for the very reason that we do not want our decisions to be read too broadly and we do not want them to mislead, and I think that is what I was doing in my concurrence there.

Well, I think it is inevitable, to this extent: What we are dealing, as you know, in the Metro—let us take the contrast between Metro and Croson—we are dealing there with a contrast between the treatment to be given the congressional power, whether it be under section 5 of the 14th amendment or under its article I power in the case of Metro, and in Croson the court was dealing with the authority of a lower unit of government, in that case a city council, to take rate into consideration.The proposition which Metro stands for is that the congressional power to engage in this kind of limited remedial action, which does indeed take some account of race, is to be judged under the middletier standard of scrutiny, whereas, the power of a lesser unit of government, State, local, county, is to be judged under the higher standard of strict scrutiny.Therefore Metro is one step in what I assume will be a long line of cases that is going to result in the definition of the scope of congressional power over remedial and race conscious with—of remedial legislation with race conscious references.Bakke of course was a case which struck down the use by the State of California of a strict quota but recognized, at least through Justice Powell's swing opinion, recognized the possibility of taking race into account solely for the purposes of creating diversity.So, I think for present purposes the most instructive contrast right now is the Metro v. Croson contrast.

Yes, sir. 

Senator, I have thought about it. I will be candid to say that I did not try to do special research on it, because I did not think that was the point of your question. I am going to give you an answer. I have thought of this carefully, and I am going to give you an answer which is different from any other answer that I have given here; but it is the only honest one I can give you: I do not know. I could go on at great length about where I reach the point of not knowing, but the truth is I do not know. There is no law on the subject that I am aware of that is helpful to me to work from, and I do not know the answer. 

Senator, the problem which your question raises is what article III means when it speaks of not only regulation but exception by Congress to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. As you know, there have been two cases on the subject really, and they do not answer our question for us. One seems to go one way, and one seems to go the other way.The most that I can say, and perhaps this is saying a lot, is that we do not have to argue about the—we have been using the word fundamental, and I will use it here—the fundamental importance of Marbury v. Madison as establishing basically the structure of the Government of the United States. And the consequences of assuming that the power to except from the jurisdiction is a power which Congress in effect can exercise in any way it sees fit is basically to deny the possibility of national unity in constitutional interpretation.I do not—I can only say this, that I do not at this point understand how such a result could be justified.

I do not think I can put it that way, because I do not know what distinction I would then draw in refusing to go down the rest of the amendments.

But, no, I think I have gone as far as I can go on an issue which is always theoretically lurking and is perhaps lurking with more than theory at times, when Supreme Court decisions are subject to vigorous challenge. But the significance of the issue is one which I hope you will leave these hearings realizing that I do not underestimate. 

I do not think that as a per se kind of rule we can make that assumption, simply because of the recognition within the document itself that capital punishment exists and a recognition which implies the assumption that the drafters accepted it as legitimate.

The answer is yes, for this reason. And I think this reason indicates the point at which you and I have sometimes parted company in the discussion of the consistency of my views. When you are speaking of original intent, as I understand it, and as I understand what you have just said, you are referring to original intent in the sense of the specific intent of the drafters to deal with specific problems and conversely their provable intent not to deal with other specific problems by the application of that particular provision of the 14th amendment. And I do not believe that that kind of specific intentionalism is a valid interpretative canon.I believe, that is why, as I have said, that is why I have used the terms original meaning or understanding to get away from that sense of specific intentionalism. And once that is done, then I think I have a perfectly consistent position.

Excuse me. I just do not mean to shift. I mean, I start with a sense of original meaning. It is not a retreat from something.

Not if you have established a meaning which is different or which establishes a different principle from the one that you are applying. But I think once again the reason that there is some perplexity in our exchange is that you say, as you did a moment ago, Senator, you are accepting the view that the equal protection guarantee means more—I think that was your phrase— than it meant at the time it was adopted, than it was intended to mean by the drafters. And what I am saying is not that it in some sense means more. I am saying that its application was not restricted and cannot be restricted to just those specific instances that the drafters intended to deal with at the time they drafted it.I do not think the principle means more. It is simply that its application is not restricted to the immediate problems that they had in mind to deal with when they adopted that and when they drafted it.

Senator, it depresses me that you may think that I am in this inconsistency. I think, in the narrowest compass, the reason that you are sort of reading me out of interpretivism is that you are making the assumption that the only brand of originalism, if you will, that is a genuinely interpretist brand is the brand of specific intent. And with respect, I think that is not, I think that is not so.I think the brand of original meaning or original understanding is in fact a valid interpretivist position. And the only point at which that comes in in any way in conflict, if it is in conflict, with what you describe as the intentions of the framers of the amendment is at the point at which we say, when they drafted a provision which was broader than necessary to perform the specific functions they had in mind, they really meant what they said and we have a broader principle.

Thank you, Senator. May I just say before you leave that I am very proud to have been a part of a process in which you participated. 

I would like to rephrase my statement of objective just slightly. I think you will appreciate it. I wish I knew whom I am quoting; I should know but I do not. But I would like to say that 

If there is a direction to err in, it is the direction that is summed up in the phrase that looks to our law for what was described as the just restraints that make people free. That is the direction that I should like to err in. That is what I shall seek. 

Yes. 

Well, I think it is fair to say that you look at the whole continuum for whatever the evidence may be worth. The whole continuum may tell you something about what you can extrapolate from it as a principle which either is or is not continuous through our history. I do not think there is a point at which you can say, well, I draw the line and I will consider no evidence after this point or no evidence before this point. But the point is, at whatever historical period the evidence may come into existence, what we are really looking for is a principle of liberty which can reasonably be said to have been assumed in the Constitution. 

Well, I guess my only cavil is, I do not, I do not think it is, it is probably right to phrase it by saying that is a sufficient amount of time. That is certainly indicative of the acceptance of a principle during that time, and that is good evidence. The question is, is there any other evidence? Is there evidence to the contrary? Is the evidence of whatever principle may be behind the 30 year or the 50 year or whatever year tradition, a sufficiently reliable indication of an enduring principle of liberty.

I promise you, Mr. Chairman, I really will be brief in what I have to say. There are two things that I do want to say.The first I will address to you, but I will address to you as the chairman of this entire committee. It is one of those things that goes without saying, it would go without saying, but it must be said. And that is you have treated me with such consummate fairness, and the whole committee has, that in whatever court I may sit I hope I will always be able to do as well when I am presiding.The second thing is to thank you and the committee for something broader than that even. That is, I realize there are many alternatives that you may have or some alternatives that you may have in considering a nomination like this. What I am most grateful for is that you have not only, and you are now not only considering my nomination, but you have made me a part of that great process. I am very proud to have been here. I am very grateful to you for having me, every one of you. Thank you.

Thank you, sir.
