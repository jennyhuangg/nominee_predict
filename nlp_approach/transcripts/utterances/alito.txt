I do. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am deeply honored to appear before you. I am deeply honored to have been nominated for a position on the Supreme Court, and I am humbled to have been nominated for the seat that is now held by Justice O’Connor. Justice O’Connor has been a pioneer, and her dedicated service of the Supreme Court will never be forgotten, and the people of the country certainly owe her a great debt for the service that she has provided.I am very thankful to the President for nominating me, and I am also thankful to the members of this Committee and many other Senators who took time from their busy schedules to meet with me. That was a great honor for me, and I appreciate all of the courtesies that were extended to me during those visits. And I want to thank Senator Lautenberg and Governor Whitman for coming here today and for their kind introductions.During the previous weeks, an old story about a lawyer who argued a case before the Supreme Court has come to my mind, and I thought I might begin this afternoon by sharing that story. The story goes as follows:This was a lawyer who had never argued a case before the Court before, and when the argument began, one of the Justices said, ‘‘How did you get here?’’ meaning how had his case worked its way up through the court system. But the lawyer was rather nervous, and he took the question literally, and he said—and this was some years ago. He said, ‘‘I came here on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.’’This story has come to my mind in recent weeks because I have often asked myself how in the world did I get here. And I want to try to answer that today and not by saying that I came here on I– 95 or on Amtrak.I am who I am in the first place because of my parents and because of the things that they taught me, and I know from my own experience as a parent that parents probably teach most powerfully not through their words but through their deeds. And my parents taught me through the stories of their lives, and I don’t take any credit for the things that they did or the things that they experienced. But they made a great impression on me.My father was brought to this country as an infant. He lost his mother as a teenager. He grew up in poverty. Although he graduated at the top of his high school class, he had no money for college, and he was set to work in a factory. But at the last minute, a kind person in the Trenton area arranged for him to receive a $50 scholarship, and that was enough in those days for him to pay the tuition at a local college and buy one used suit. And that made the difference between his working in a factory and going to college.After he graduated from college, in 1935, in the midst of the Depression, he found that teaching jobs for Italian-Americans were not easy to come by, and he had to find other work for a while. But eventually he became a teacher, and he served in the Pacific duringWorld War II, and he worked, as has been mentioned, for many years in a nonpartisan position for the New Jersey Legislature, which was an institution that he revered.His story is a story that is typical of a lot of Americans, both back in his day and today, and it is the story, as far as I can see it, about the opportunities that our country offers and also about the need for fairness and about hard work and perseverance and the power of a small good deed.My mother is a first-generation American. Her father worked in the Roebling Steel Mill in Trenton, New Jersey. Her mother came from a culture in which women generally did not even leave the house alone, and yet my mother became the first person in her family to get a college degree. She worked for more than a decade before marrying. She went to New York City to get a master’s degree, and she continued to work as a teacher and a principal until she was forced to retire. Both she and my father instilled in my sister and me a deep love of learning.I got here in part because of the community in which I grew up. It was a warm but definitely an unpretentious, down-to-earth community. Most of the adults in the neighborhood were not college graduates. I attended the public schools. In my spare time, I played baseball and other sports with my friends. And I have happy memories and strong memories of those days and good memories of the good sense and the decency of my friends and my neighbors.And after I graduated from high school, I went a full 12 miles down the road, but really to a different world, when I entered Princeton University. A generation earlier, I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton, but by the time I graduated from high school, things had changed. And this was a time of great intellectual excitement for me. Both college and law school opened up new worlds of ideas. But this was back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was a time of turmoil at colleges and universities. And I saw some very smart people and very privileged people behaving irresponsibly, and I couldn’t help making a contrast between some of the worst of what I saw on the campus and the good sense and the decency of the people back in my own community.I am here in part because of my experiences as a lawyer. I had the good fortune to begin my legal career as a law clerk for a judge who really epitomized open-mindedness and fairness. He read the record in detail in every single case that came before me. He insisted on scrupulously following precedents, both the precedents of the Supreme Court and the decisions of his own court, the Third Circuit. He taught all of his law clerks that every case has to be decided on an individual basis, and he really didn’t have much use for any grand theories.After my clerkship finished, I worked for more than a decade as an attorney in the Department of Justice, and I can still remember the day as an Assistant U.S. Attorney when I stood up in court for the first time and I proudly said, ‘‘My name is Samuel Alito, and I represent the United States in this court.’’ It was a great honor for me to have the United States as my client during all of those years.I have been shaped by the experiences of the people who are closest to me, by the things I have learned from Martha; by my hopes and my concerns for my children, Phillip and Laura; by the experiences of members of my family, who are getting older; by my sister’s experiences as a trial lawyer in a profession that has traditionally been dominated by men. And, of course, I have been shaped for the last 15 years by my experiences as a judge of the court of appeals.During that time, I have sat on thousands of cases. Somebody mentioned the exact figure this morning. I don’t know what the exact figure is, but it is way up in the thousands. And I have written hundreds of opinions. And the members of this Committee and the members of their staff who have had the job of reviewing all of those opinions really have my sympathy.[Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I think that may have constituted cruel and unusual punishment. I have learned a lot during my years on the Third Circuit, particularly, I think, about the way in which a judge should go about the work of judging. I have learned by doing, by sitting on all of these cases, and I think I have also learned from the examples of some really remarkable colleagues. When I became a judge, I stopped being a practicing attorney, and that was the big change in role. The role of a practicing attorney is to achieve a desirable result for the client in the particular case at hand. But a judge can’t think that way. A judge can’t have any agenda. A judge can’t have any preferred outcome in any particular case. And a judge certainly doesn’t have a client. The judge’s only obligation—and it’s a solemn obligation—is to the rule of law, and what that means is that in every single case, the judge has to do what the law requires. Good judges develop certain habits of mind. One of those habits of mind is the habit of delaying reaching conclusions until everything has been considered. Good judges are always open to the possibility of changing their minds based on the next brief that they read or the next argument that is made by an attorney who is appearing before them or a comment that is made by a colleague during the conference on the case, when the judges privately discuss the case. It has been a great honor for me to spend my career in public service. It has been a particular honor for me to serve on the court of appeals for these past 15 years because it has given me the opportunity to use whatever talent I have to serve my country by upholding the rule of law. And there is nothing that is more important for our Republic than the rule of law. No person in this country, no matter how high or powerful, is above the law, and no person in this country is beneath the law. Fifteen years ago, when I was sworn in as a judge of the court of appeals, I took an oath. I put my hand on the Bible and I swore that I would administer justice without respect to persons, that I would do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I would carry out my duties under the Constitution and the laws of the United States. And that is what I have tried to do to the very best57 of my ability for the past 15 years, and if I am confirmed, I pledge to you that that is what I would do on the Supreme Court.Thank you. 

Senator, I do agree that the Constitution protects a right to privacy, and it protects the right to privacy in a number of ways. The Fourth Amendment certainly speaks to the right of privacy. People have a right to privacy in their homes and in their papers, and in their persons. And the standard for whether something is a search is whether there’s an invasion of a right to privacy, a legitimate expectation of privacy.

I agree that Griswold is now I think understood by the Supreme Court as based on the Liberty Clauses of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment.

I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt. 

Well, I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important doctrine. It’s a fundamental part of our legal system, and it’s the principle that courts in general should follow their past precedents, and it’s important for a variety of reasons. It’s important because it limits the power of the judiciary. It’s important because it protects reliance interest, and it’s important because it re-flect the view that courts should respect the judgments and the wisdom that are embodied in prior judicial decisions. It’s not an inexorable command, but it is a general presumption that courts are going to follow prior precedents, and as you mentioned—

Well, reliance is, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, one of the important foundations of the doctrine of stare decisis. It is intended to protect reliance interests, and people can rely on judicial decisions in a variety of ways. There can be concrete economic reliance. Government institutions can be built up in reliance on prior decisions. Practices of agencies and Government officials can be molded based on reliance. People can rely on decisions in a variety of ways. In my view—

Well, I think that the Court, and all the courts, the Supreme Court, my court, all the Federal courts, should be insulated from public opinion. They should do what the law requires in all instances. That’s why they’re not—that’s why the members of the judiciary are not elected. We have a basically democratic form of Government, but the judiciary is not elected, and that’s the reason, so that they don’t do anything under fire. They do what the law requires.

Mr. Chairman, I think that the legitimacy of the Court would be undermined in any case if the Court made a decision based on its perception of public opinion. It should make its decisions based on the Constitution and the law. It should not be— it should not sway in the wind of public opinion at any time.

Well, I agree that in every case in which there is a prior precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare decisis, and the presumption is that the Court will follow its prior precedents. There needs to be a special justification for overruling a prior precedent.

Well, I think that Chief Justice Rehnquist there was getting at a very important point, and—

I think he was getting at—he was right in saying that reliance can take many forms. It can take a very specific and concrete form, and there can be reliance in the sense that he was talking about there, and I think what he’s talking about there is that a great many people, and in that instance, police departments around the country, over a long period of time, had adapted to the Miranda rule, had internalized it. I think that all the branches of Government had become familiar with it and comfortable with it, and had come to regard it as a good way—after a considerable breaking in period—a good way of dealing with a difficult problem, and the problem was how to deal with interrogations leading to confessions, in terms of— 

I think the Constitution is a living thing in the sense that matters, and that is that it is—it sets up a framework of Government and a protection of fundamental rights that we have lived under very successfully for 200 years, and the genius of it is that it is not terribly specific on certain things. It sets out some things are very specific, but it sets out some general principles, and then leaves it for each generation to apply those to the particular factual situations that come up. 

The liberty component of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment, which I was talking about earlier, embody the deeply rooted traditions of the country, and it’s up to each— those traditions and those rights apply to new factual situations that come up. As times change, new factual situations come up, and the principles have to be applied to those situations. The principles don’t change. The Constitution itself doesn’t change, but the factual situations change, and as new situations come up, the principles and the rights have to be applied to them.

Well, I personally would not get into categorizing precedents as super precedents or super duper precedents, or any—

Right. 

Any sort of categorization like that— 

I agree with the underlying thought that when a precedent is reaffirmed, that strengthens the precedent, and when the Supreme Court says that we are not— 

Well, I think that when a precedent is reaffirmed, each time it’s reaffirmed that is a factor that should be taken into account in making the judgment about stare decisis, and when a precedent is reaffirmed on the ground that stare decisis precludes or counsels against reexamination of the merits of the precedent, then I agree that that is a precedent on precedent. Now, I don’t want to leave the impression that stare decisis is an inexorable command because the Supreme Court has said that it is not, but it is a judgment that has to be based, taking into account all of the factors that are relevant and that are set out in the Supreme Court’s cases. 

Well, that was a correct statement of what I thought in 1985 from my vantage point in 1985, and that was as a line attorney in the Department of Justice in the Reagan administration. Today if the issue were to come before me, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed and the issue were to come before me, the first question would be the question that we’ve been discussing, and that’s the issue of stare decisis. And if the analysis were to get beyond that point, then I would approach the question with an open mind, and I would listen to the arguments that were made. 

Absolutely, Senator. That was a statement that I made at a prior period of time when I was performing a different role, and as I said yesterday, when someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge thinks about legal issues. 

Well, there is, Senator, and what I said was that that was a true expression of my views at the time, the statement in the 1985 appointment form that I filled out. It was a statement that I made at a time when I was a line attorney in the Department of Justice. I’m not saying that I made the statement simply because I was advocating the administration’s position, but that was the position that I held at the time, and that was the position of the administration. 

Well, an advocate has the goal of achieving the result that the client wants within the bounds of professional responsibility. That’s what an advocate is supposed to do, and that’s what I attempted to do during my years as an advocate for the Federal Government. Now, a judge doesn’t have a client, as I said yesterday, and a judge doesn’t have an agenda, and a judge has to follow the law. An important part of the law in this area, as we look at it in 2006, is the law of stare decisis.

Well, what you said is correct, Senator. I cast the deciding vote there to strike down the Pennsylvania statute, and I did it because that’s what I thought the law required. I thought the law required that we defer to the interpretation of the Federal statute that had been made by the Department of Health and Human Services. If I had had an agenda to strike down any—I’m sorry, to uphold any regulation of abortion that came up in any case that was presented to me, then I would have voted with Judge Nygaard in that case, and that would have turned the decision the other way.I’ve sat on three abortion cases on the Third Circuit. In one of them—that was the Casey case—I voted to uphold regulations of abortion, and in the other two—the Elizabeth Blackwell case and Planned Parenthood v. Farmer—I voted to strike them down. And in each instance, I did it because that’s what I thought the law required.

I do. I think it provides a very useful framework, and it has been used by the Supreme Court in a number of important subsequent cases, in the Dames and Moore, for example, involving the release of the hostages from Iran. And it doesn’t answerevery question that comes up in this area, but it provides a very useful way of looking at them.

Absolutely. That’s a very important principle. Our Constitution applies in times of peace and in times of war, and it protects the rights of Americans under all circumstances.

I certainly do, Senator. The Bill of Rights applies at all times, and it’s particularly important that we adhere to the Bill of Rights in times of war and in times of national crisis, because that’s when there’s the greatest temptation to depart from them. 

Well, probably the first consideration would be to evaluate the statutory question, and you outlined some of the factors and the issues that would arise in interpreting the statute, what is meant by the provision of FISA that you quoted regarding FISA—the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—being the exclusive means for conducting surveillance. And then, depending on how one worked through that statutory question, then I think one might look to Justice Jackson’s framework. And he said that he divided cases in this area into three categories where the President acts with explicit or implicit congressional approval, where the President acts and Congress has not expressed its view on the matter one way or the other, and the final category where the President exercises Executive power and Congress—and that is in the face of an explicit or implicit congressional opposition to it. And depending on how one worked through the statutory issue, then the case might fall into one of those three areas.But these questions that you pose are obviously very difficult and important and complicated questions that are quite likely to arise in litigation, perhaps before my own court or before the Supreme Court.

I do, Senator. I think the most important part of the memo that you are referring to is a fairly big section that discussed theoretical problems, and it consists of a list of questions, and many of the questions are the questions that you have just raised. In that memo, I said this is an unexplored area, and hereare the theoretical questions that—and, of course, they are of more than theoretical importance—that arise in this area.That memo is labeled a rough first effort at stating the position of the administration. I was writing there on behalf of a working group that was looking into the question of implementing a decision that had already been made by the Attorney General to issue signing statements for the purpose of weighing in on the meaning of statutes. And in this memo—as I said, it was a rough first effort, and the biggest part of it, to my mind, was the statement there are difficult theoretical interpretive questions here and here they are. And had I followed up on it—and I don’t believe I had the opportunity to pursue this issue further during my time in the Justice Department—it would have been necessary to explore all those questions.

Good morning, Senator. 

It is, and I think I said in answering the Chairman that there are theoretical issues but they have considerable practical importance. But the theoretical issues really have to be explored and resolved. I don’t believe the Supreme Court has done that up to this point. I have not had occasion in my 15-plus years on the Third Circuit to come to grips with the question of what is the significance of a Presidential signing statement in interpreting a statute. 

Well, I think the first thing that has to be said is what I said yesterday, and that is that no person in this country is above the law, and that includes the President and it includes the Supreme Court. Everybody has to follow the law, and that means the Constitution of the United States and it means the laws that are enacted under the Constitution of the United States.Now, there are questions that arise concerning Executive powers, and those specific questions have to be resolved, I think, by looking to that framework that Justice Jackson set out that I mentioned earlier.

Well, if we were in—if a question came up of that nature, then I think you’d be in where the President is exercising Executive power in the face of a contrary expression of congressional will through a statute or even an implicit expression of congressional will. You would be in what Justice Jackson called ‘‘the twilight zone,’’ where the President’s power is at its lowest point, and I think you would have to look at the specifics of the situation. These are the gravest sort of constitutional questions that come up, and very often they don’t make their way to the judiciary or they are not resolved by the judiciary. They are resolved by the other branches of the Government.

Senator, as I said, the President has to follow the Constitution and the laws and, in fact, one of the most solemn responsibilities of the President—and it is set out expressly in the Constitution—is that the President is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and that means the Constitution, it means statutes, it means treaties, it means all of the laws of the United States.But what I am saying is that sometimes issues of Executive power arise and they have to be analyzed under the framework that Justice Jackson set out. And you do get cases that are in this twilight zone and it is—they have to be decided when they come up based on the specifics of the situation.

Well, Senator, if you are in that situation, you may have a question about the constitutionality of a congressional enactment. You have to know the specifics of—

Neither the President nor anybody else, I think, can authorize someone to—can override a statute that is constitutional. And I think you are in this—when you are in the third category, under Justice Jackson, that is the issue which you are grappling with.

And Congress has done that, and it is certainly an expression of a very deep value of our country.

Well, Senator, I think the important points are that the President has to follow the Constitution and the laws, and it is up to Congress to exercise its legislative power. But as to specific issues that might come up, I really need to know the specifics. I need to know what was done and why it was done, and hear the arguments on the issue.

The President has to comply with the Fourth Amendment and the President has to comply with the statutes that are passed. This is an issue I was speaking about with Chairman Specter that I think is very likely to result in litigation in the Federal courts. It could be in my court. It certainly could get to the Supreme Court and there may be statutory issues involved—the meaning of the provision of FISA that you mentioned, the meaning certainly of the authorization for the use of military force—and those would have to be resolved.And in order to resolve them, I would have to know the arguments that are made by the contending parties. On what basis is it claimed that there is a violation? On what basis would the President claim that what occurred fell within the authorization of the authorization for the use of military force? And then if you got beyond that, there could be constitutional questions about the Fourth Amendment, whether it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment, whether it was the valid exercise of Executive power.

Well, Senator, I think the in first instance the Government would have to come forward with its theory as to why the actions that were taken were lawful. I think that is correct.

Certainly, if someone is the subject of a search and they claim that the search violates a statute or it violates the Constitution, then they would have standing to sue and they could sue in a Federal court that had jurisdiction.

Certainly. If someone has been the subject of illegal law enforcement activities, they should have a day in court and that is what the courts are there for, to protect the rights of individuals against the government and to—or anyone else who violates their rights. And they have to be absolutely independent and treat everybody equally.

They are very significant. 

I agree, Senator. I tried to follow what the Fourth Amendment required when I was a prosecutor and I regard it as very important. 

No, he would not. That was settled in that case. The Supreme Court held that the Attorney General does not have— 

Actually, I recommended that that argument not be made. It was made and I think it is important to understand the context of that. First of all— 

That is correct, and the background of that, if I could just explain very briefly—

No. Absolutely, it is the job of the judiciary to enforce the Constitution. 

Well, Senator, I haven’t had occasion to think that what I said in that case was correct, but let me just explain what was going on there. 

The issue there was whether—the first issue was whether the warrant authorized the search of people who were onthe premises and that was the disagreement between me and the majority and it was a rather technical issue about whether the affidavit that was submitted by police officers was properly incorporated into the warrant for the purposes of saying who could be searched.And I thought that it was, and I thought that it was quite clear that the magistrate had authorized a search for people who were on the premises. That was the point of disagreement. I was not pleased that a young girl was searched in that case and I said so in my opinion. That was an undesirable thing, but the issue wasn’t whether there should be some sort of rule of Fourth Amendment law that a minor can never be searched. And I think if we were to—

I do think you are, Senator. 

I think you need to take into account what was going on here. The police officers prepared an affidavit and they said we have probable cause to believe that this drug dealer hides drugs on people who are on the premises. And therefore, when we search, we want authorization not just to search him, but to search everybody who is found on the premises because we think he hides—we have reason to believe he hides drugs there. And the magistrate who issued the warrant said that the affidavit was incorporated into the warrant for the purpose of establishing probable cause. And we are supposed to read warrants in a common-sense fashion because they are prepared by police officers for the most part, not by lawyers, and they are often prepared under a lot of time pressure. And it seemed to me that, reading this in a common-sense fashion, what the magistrate intended to do was to say, yes, you have authorization to do what you ask us to do. But even beyond that, the issue there was whether these police officers could be sued for damages, and they couldn’t be sued for damages if a reasonable officer could have believed that that is what the magistrate intended to authorize. And I thought that surely a reasonable officer could view it that way. Now, Judge Chertoff looked at it differently and there are cases where reasonable people disagree, and that is all that was going on. 

Well, Senator, I have racked my memory about this issue, and I really have no specific recollection of that organization. But since I put it down on that statement, then I certainly must have been a member at that time. But if I had been actively involved in the organization in any way, if I had attended meetings or been actively involved in any way, I would certainly remember that, and I don’t.I have tried to think of what might have caused me to sign up for membership, and if I did, it must have been around that time. And the issue that had rankled me about Princeton for some time was the issue of ROTC. I was in ROTC when I was at Princeton, and the unit was expelled from the campus. And I felt that wasvery wrong. I had a lot of friends who were against the war in Vietnam, and I respected their opinions, but I didn’t think that it was right to oppose the military for that reason. And the issue, although the Army unit was eventually brought back, the Navy and the Air Force units did not come back, and the issue kept coming up. And there were people who were strongly opposed to having any unit on campus, and the attitude seemed to be that the military was a bad institution and that Princeton was too good for the military, and that Princeton would somehow be sullied if people in uniform were walking around the campus, that the courses didn’t merit getting credit, that the instructors shouldn’t be viewed as part of the faculty. And that was the issue that bothered me about that.

Well, Senator, as you said, from what I now know about the group, it seemed to be dedicated to the idea of bringing back the Princeton that existed at a prior point in time, and as you said, somebody from my background would not have been comfortable in an institution like that, and that certainly was not any part of my thinking in whatever I did in relation to this group. 

I certainly was not a founding member. 

I was not a board member. 

I don’t believe I did anything that was active in relation to this organization.

Absolutely no, Senator, no. 

Senator, I had never attended a non-coeducational school until I went to Princeton, and after I was there a short time, I realized the benefits of attending a co-educational school. [Laughter.] 

I do, Senator, and someone not from any sort of exalted economic status. 

No. It’s something like a fraternity, except it’s just a facility. It’s a private facility where students eat. Traditionally, they were selective. They had a process like Vicker and they chose people that they thought fit in with the group. 

And I did not choose to belong to an eating club. I belonged to a university facility called Stevenson Hall, which was named after Adlai Stevenson, and it was one of the most co-educational facilities on the campus. It was not selective. It was attractive to me because a lot of faculty members went there for lunch. There was a master who lived on the facility with his family, and it was an opportunity at dinner and lunch to talk to faculty members. 

I certainly had no such desire, and I think that what I did when I was a student at Princeton and my activities since then illustrate that.As I said, when I was at Princeton, I was a member of this university facility, and it was open to everybody, and it was one of the most co-educational facilities on the campus. And since graduating, I have actually been involved in a way in the admissions process. I was on the Schools Committee for a number of years and interviewed applicants to Princeton, and I think that shows my attitude toward the general way in which the university has been run.

I was, Senator. 

I was. 

I was proud to be a member, and the unit was thrown off the campus after—well, the decision was made shortly after I joined the ROTC, and so I attended the ROTC classes on the campus during my junior year, but during my senior year the unit had been expelled from the campus, and I had to go to Trenton State College occasionally to finish up my ROTC work. 

That’s correct. It was very extensively damaged. 

I don’t recall that anybody was injured, but certainly there’s a serious risk of injury whenever an arson takes place. 

Thank you, Senator, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this because a lot has been said about it and very little by me. And I think that once the facts are set out, I think that everybody will realize that in this instance I not only complied with the ethical rules that are binding on Federal judges—and they’re very strict—but also that I did what I have tried to do throughout my career as a judge, and that is to go beyond the letter of the ethics rules and to avoid any situation where there might be an ethical question raised.And this was a case where—this is a case that came up in 2002, 12 years after I took the bench, and I acknowledge that if I had to do it over again, there are things that I would have done differently. And it’s not because I violated any ethical standard, but it’s because when this case first came before me, I did not focus on the issue of recusal and apply my own personal standard, which is to go beyond what the code of conduct for judges requires.This was a pro se case, and we take our pro se cases very seriously.

It’s a case where the plaintiff was not represented by a lawyer. She was representing—she was representing— 

She represented herself initially, and we take those very seriously. We give those just as much consideration—in fact, more consideration in many respects than we do with the cases without lawyers because we take into account that somebody who’s representing himself or herself can’t be expected to comply with all the legal technicalities.But for whatever reason, our court system for handling the monitoring of recusals in these pro se cases is different from the system that we use in the cases with lawyers. And maybe that’s because recusal issues don’t come up very often in pro se cases. But, in any event, in a case with a lawyer, before the case is ever sent to us, we receive what are known as clearance sheets, and those are—it’s a stack of papers and it lists all the cases that the clerk’s office is thinking of sending to us. It lists the parties in each case, and it lists the lawyers in each case. And it says, ‘‘Do you need to recuse yourself in any of these cases?’’ And this is the time when the judges and this is the time when I focus on the issue of recusal, and I look at each case. I look at the parties. I look at the lawyers. And I ask myself: Is there a reason why I should not participate in the case?Now, because this case, the Monga case, was a pro se case, it didn’t come to me with clearance sheets. I just received the briefs, and it had been through our staff attorneys’ office. They take a first look at the pro se cases, and they try to make sure—they try to translate the pro se arguments into the sort of legal arguments that lawyers would make to help the pro se litigants. And they give us a recommended disposition and a draft opinion.And when this came to me, I just didn’t focus on the issue of recusal, and I sat on the initial appeal in the case. And then after the case was decided, I received a recusal motion. And I was quite concerned because I take my ethical responsibilities very seriously.So I looked into the question of whether I was required under the code—because I just wanted to see where the law was on this. Was I required under the code of conduct to recuse myself in this case? And it seemed to me that I was not. And a number of legal experts, experts on legal ethics, have now looked into this question, and their conclusion is no, I was not required to recuse.But I didn’t stand on that because of my own personal policy of going beyond what the code requires, so I did recuse myself. And not only that, I asked that the original decision in the case be vacated, that is, wiped off the books and that the losing party in the case, the appellant, Ms. Monga, be given an entirely new appeal before an entirely new panel. And that was done.I wanted to make sure that she did not go away from this case with the impression that she had gotten anything less than an absolutely fair hearing. And then beyond that, I realized that the fact that this has slipped through in a pro se case pointed to a bigger problem, and that was the absence of clearance sheets.So since that time, I have developed my own forms that I use in my own chambers, and for pro se cases now, there is—I have a red sheet of paper printed up, and it is red so nobody misses it. And when a pro se case comes in, it initially goes to my law clerks, and they prepare a clearance sheet for me in that case, and then they do an initial check to see whether they spot any recusal problem.And if they don’t, then there’s a space at the bottom where they initial it. And then it comes to me, and there’s a space at the bottom for me to initial to make sure that I focus on the recusal problem. And in very bold print at the bottom of the sheet for my secretary, it says, ‘‘No vote is to be sent in in this case unless this form is completely filled out.’’So there are a number of internal checks now in my own office to make sure that I follow my own policy of going beyond what the code requires.

Absolutely no chance. 

That’s correct, Senator. 

I did not think the code required— 

That’s right. 

I did, Senator, and that is what I have tried to do throughout my time on the bench.

They ruled the same way that we had, and we had ruled the same way that the district court did.

That’s correct, Senator. 

I have, yes. 

Yes, certainly, Senator. Brinson v. Vaughn is an example of that. That was a habeas case involving a murder conviction, and I concluded and my panel concluded—and I wrote the opinion saying that there had been racial discrimination, or enough to have a hearing on the possibility of racial discrimination in the selection of the jury in that case. And, therefore, we reversed the decision of the district court.Williams v. Price is another example. There we found—and that was another murder case, and so what is involved here in these cases is really the most important thing that is litigated on the criminal side in the Federal courts. That was a case where the district court had denied a writ of habeas corpus, and we reversed because we found that there had been an error in excluding testimony that showed racial bias on the part of the jurors.There was another murder case, United States v. Murray. This was a Federal prosecution, and we had to reverse there because we concluded—and I wrote the opinion there—that the prosecutors had introduced evidence—

My general philosophy is that the judiciary has a very important role to play, and in speaking with Senator Leahy, I highlighted some of that. But the judiciary has to protect rights, and it should be vigorous in doing that, and it should be vigorous in enforcing the law and in interpreting the law, in interpreting thelaw in accordance with what it really means and enforcing the law even if that’s unpopular.But although the judiciary has a very important role to play, it’s a limited role. It is not—it should always be asking itself whether it is straying over the bounds, whether it’s invading the authority of the legislature, for example, whether it is making policy judgments rather than interpreting the law. And that has to be a constant process of re-examination on the part of the judges. And that’s the role that the judiciary should play.Now, my experience on the bench has really reinforced for me the importance of the appellate process and the judicial process that I described yesterday. And that is the process of really engaging the arguments that are made, reading the briefs, and approaching it with an open mind, always with the possibility of changing your mind based on the arguments and based on the facts of a particular case.

I think that’s a solemn responsibility that they have. When you know that you are the Court of last resort, you have to make sure that you get it right.It is not true, in my judgment, that the Supreme Court is free to do anything that it wants. It has to follow the Constitution, and it has to follow the laws. Stare decisis, which I was talking about earlier, is an important limitation on what the Supreme Court does. And although the Supreme Court has the power to overrule a prior precedent, it uses that power sparingly, and rightfully so. It should be limited in what it does.

I do. I think that’s a very important principle. As I recall, Justice Brandeis in the Ashwander case was the one who articulated it most eloquently, and it’s, therefore, an important reason because a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court has a permanency that a decision on an issue of statutory interpretation doesn’t have. So if a case is decided on statutory grounds, there’s a possibility of Congress amending the statute to correct the decision if it’s perceived that the decision is incorrect or it’s producing undesirable results.I think that it’s—my philosophy of the way I approach issues is to try to make sure that I get right what I decide, and that counsels in favor of not trying to do too much, not trying to decide questions that are too broad, not trying to decide questions that don’t have to be decided, and not going to broader grounds for a decision when a narrower ground is available.

The standards of review are very important, and often they are prescribed by Congress. Congress gives us authority, jurisdiction to decide certain questions, but it says that you don’t have the authority to go back and do what the trial—what you would have done if you were the trial judge or if you were the administrative agency; you have a limited authority of review. And I think it’s very important for us to stay within the bounds of the authority that Congress gives us. I think that’s a very important part of our function.

Yes, it was, Senator. And as I said in answering Senator Hatch’s question, if I had it to do over again, I would have handled this case differently. There were some oversights—

Senator, I’m familiar with that. I don’t really need to see the document. Senator, the name Vanguard certainly appears on the briefs, and it appeared in the draft opinion that was sent to us by the staff attorney’s office. I just didn’t focus on the issue of recusal when it came up, and that was an oversight on my part, because it didn’t give me the opportunity to apply my personal policy in going beyond what the code requires.

I believe that they did. I believe that some of them at least addressed that specifically—

I believe they addressed it in their letter, so they must have been aware of it.

Professor Hazard, I know, addressed that directly in his letter. I think Professor Rotunda addressed it in his letter, so, obviously, if the letters addressed the issue, they were aware of what was said on the Senate questionnaire.

I did not focus on the issue of recusal I think because 12 years had gone by, and the issue of a Vanguard recusal hadn’t come up. And one of the reasons why judges tend to invest in mutual funds is because they generally don’t present recusal problems, and pro se cases in particular generally don’t presentrecusal problems. And so, no light went off. That’s all I can say. I didn’t focus on the issue of recusal.

It had, Senator, but I had nothing to gain financially by—

They are, and that’s a very inapt phrase, and I— 

It’s an inapt phrase, and I certainly didn’t mean that literally at the time, and I wouldn’t say that today. The branches of Government are equal. They have different responsibilities, but they are all equal, and no branch is supreme to the other branch. 

No, I haven’t changed my mind, Senator, but the phrasing there is very misleading and incorrect. I think what I was getting at is the fact that our Constitution gives the judiciary a particular role, and there are instances in which it can override the judgments that are made by Congress and by the Executive, but for the most part our Constitution leaves it to the elected branches of Government to make the policy decisions for our country. 

There was some additional information regarding these people that was important, and that was that they had threatened other people, as I recall, and there was evidence about the possession of weapons and evidence that they would be dangerous, and that was the basis on which the marshals acted the way they did. This was a case in which they were—the marshals were sued for civil damages, and they asserted what’s called the Qualified Immunity Defense, and that means that if a reasonable person could have thought there was a basis for doing what they did, then they are entitled not to be tried. And that’s the law. I didn’t make up that law. 

That’s not a legal standard that I made up, and that was the way I saw the case, and that’s the way the other judge, who was in the majority, saw the case. Now, these cases involve difficult line-drawing arguments at times, and I respect Judge Rendell’s view of this very much, but reasonable people will view these things differently. 

The Supreme Court has told us how we have to handle this issue, and it is for the judiciary to decide in the first place whether a reasonable officer could have thought that what the officer was doing was consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and we have to make that decision. Now, if we decide that there’s an issue of fact. If there’s a dispute in the testimony about the evidence that the marshals had or about what these individuals were doing at the time when the search was taking place, or what the marshals did, and certainly those factual issues have to be resolved by the jury. 

Senator, I wasn’t happy that a 10-year-old was searched. Now, there wasn’t any claim in this case that the search was carried out in any sort of an abusive fashion. It was carried out by a female officer, and that wasn’t the issue in the case. And I don’t think that there should be a Fourth Amendment rule. But, of course, it’s not up to me to decide that minors can never be searched, because if we had a rule like that, then where would drug dealers hide their drugs? That would lead to greater abuse of minors.The technical issue in the case was really not whether a warrant can incorporate a search warrant—an affidavit. There’s no dispute that a judge or a magistrate issuing a warrant can say that the affidavit is incorporated, and that was done here. The issue was whether—and it was a very technical issue. Was it incorporated only on the issue of probable cause or was it also incorporated on the issue of who would be searched? If the magistrate had said in the warrant, this warrant is incorporated as to the people who may be searched, and then in the affidavit it said, and it did say this very clearly, we want authorization to search anybody who’s on the premises, then there would be no problem whatsoever.The warrant said it was incorporated on the issue of probable cause, and I thought that reading it in a common sense fashion, which is what we’re supposed to do, that necessarily meant that the magistrate said there was probable cause to search anybody who’s found on the premises and that’s what I’m authorizing you to do.

When I interpret statutes, and that’s something that I do with some frequency on the Court of Appeals, where I start and often where I end is with the text of the statute. And if you do that, I think you eliminate a lot of problems involving legislative history and also with signing statements. So I think that’s the first point that I would make.Now, I don’t say I’m never going to look at legislative history, and the role of signing statements in the interpretation of statutes is, I think, a territory that’s been unexplored by the Supreme Court and it certainly is not something that I have dealt with as a judge.This memo was a memo that resulted from a working group meeting that I attended. The Attorney General had already decided that as a matter of policy, the administration, the Reagan administration, would issue signing statements for interpretive purposesand had made an arrangement with the West Publishing Company to have those published. And my task from this meeting was to summarize where the working group was going and where it had been, and I said at the beginning of the meeting that this was a rough—at the beginning of the memo that this was a rough first effort to outline what the administration was planning to do and I was a lawyer for the administration at the time. Then I had a big section of that memo saying, and these are the theoretical problems and some of them are the ones that you mentioned. And that’s where I left it, and all of that would need to be explored to go any further.

Well, Senator, let me explain what I understand the idea of the unitary Executive to be, and I think it’s—there’s been some misunderstanding, at least as to what I understand this concept to mean. I think it’s important to draw a distinction between two very different ideas. One is the scope of Executive power, and often Presidents or occasionally Presidents have asserted inherent Executive powers not set out in the Constitution. And we might think of that as how big is this table, the extent of Executive power.And the second question is when you have a power that is within the prerogative of the Executive, who controls the Executive? And those are separate questions. And the issue of, to my mind, the concept of unitary Executive doesn’t have to do with the scope of Executive power. It has to do with who within the Executive branch controls the exercise of Executive power, and the theory is the Constitution says the Executive power is conferred on the President.Now, the power that I was addressing in that speech was the power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not some inherent power but a power that is explicitly set out in the Constitution.

The status of independent agencies, I think, is now settled in the case law. This was addressed in Humphrey’s Executor way back in 1935 when the Supreme Court said that the structure of the Federal Trade Commission didn’t violate the separation of powers. And then it was revisited and reaffirmed in Wiener v. United States in 1958—

I think that Humphrey’s Executor is a well-settled precedent. What the unitary Executive, I think, means now, we would look to Morrison, I think, for the best expression of it, and it is that things cannot be arranged in such a way that interfere with the President’s exercise of his power on a functional, taking a functional approach.

Mr. Chairman, I had additional holdings in Vanguard during my period of service, but I think that the important point as far as that is concerned is that nobody has claimed that I had anything to gain financially from participating in this case and I certainly did not.

Absolutely not, Senator. 

I certainly do, Senator. Each branch has very important individual responsibilities and they should all perform their responsibilities. 

Nobody in this country is above the law, and that includes the President. 

I would not, Senator. I would judge the cases as they come up and I think that I believe very strongly in the independence of the judiciary. I have been a member of the judiciary now for the past 15-and-a-half years and I understand the role that the judiciary has to play, and one of its most important roles is to stand up and defend the rights of people when they are violated. 

Yes. Our Constitution sets up a system of government that is democratic. So the basic policy decisions are made by people who are elected by the people so that the people can control their own destiny. But the Constitution establishes certain principles that can’t be violated by the Executive branch or by the legislative branch. It sets up a structure of government that everybody has to follow and it protects fundamental rights. And it is the job of the judiciary to enforce the provisions of the Constitution and to enforce the laws that are enacted by Congress in accordance with the meaning that Congress attached to those laws, not to try to change the Constitution, not to try to change the laws, but to be vigilant in enforcing the Constitution and in enforcing the laws. 

Judges have to be careful not to inject their own views into the interpretation of the Constitution, and for that mat-ter, into the interpretation of statutes. That is not the job that we are given. That is not authority that we are given. Congress has the law-making authority. You have the authority to make the policy decisions and it’s the job of the judiciary to carry out the policy decisions that are made by Congress when it’s enacting statutes.

The Framers of the Constitution made a basic decision when they set up the Federal judiciary the way they set up it, and there’s a reason why they gave Federal judges life tenure, and that is so that they will be insulated from all of the things that you mentioned. They will not decide cases based on the way the wind is blowing at a particular time, that at a time of crisis, for example, when people may lose sight of fundamental rights, the judiciary stands up for fundamental rights, that it is not reluctant to stand up for the unpopular and for what the Court termed insular minorities, that the Constitution—that the judiciary enforces the Constitution and the laws in a steadfast way and not in accordance with the way the wind is blowing.

Judges have to respect constitutional restraints. They have to exercise what’s called judicial self-restraint because there aren’t very many external checks on the judiciary on a dayto-day basis. So the judiciary has to restrain itself and engage in a constant process of asking itself, is this something that we are supposed to be doing or are we stepping over the line and invading the area that is left to the legislative branch, for example. The judiciary has to engage in that on a constant basis.

The judiciary is not a law-making body. Congress is the law-making body. Congress has the legislative power and the judiciary has to perform its role and not try to perform the role of Congress or the Executive.

There are very important provisions of the Constitution that are not cast in specific terms, and I think for good reason. They set out a principle, and then it is up to the judiciary to apply that principle to the facts that arise during different periods in the history of our country.The example that I like to cite here is the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures in the Fourth Amendment. Now, this goes all the way back to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment at the end of the 18th century and most of the types of searches that come up today are things that the Framers never could have anticipated. They couldn’t foresee automobiles or telephones or cell phones or the Internet or any of the other means of communication that have prevented new search and seizure issues. But they set out a good principle, and the principle is that searches can’t be carried out unless they’re reasonable, and generally, there has to be a warrant issued by a neutral and detached magistrate before a search can be carried out.And so as these new types of searches have arisen and new means of communication have come into practice, the judiciary has applied this principle and the legislative branch has applied the principle in statutes like the wiretapping statute to the new situations that have come up.

I think they can. There would be no, I think, basis for judges to exercise the power of judicial review if they were doing nothing different from what the legislature does in passing statutes. So judges have to look to objective things, and if it’s a question of absolutely first impression, and there aren’t that many constitutional issues that arise at this point in our history that are completely issues of first impression, you would look to the text of the Constitution and you would look to anything that would shed light on the way in which the provision would have been understood by people reading it at the time.You certainly would look to precedent, which is an objective factor, and most of the issues that come up in constitutional law now fall within an area in which there is a rich and often very complex body of doctrine that has worked out. Search and seizure is an example. Most of the issues that arise concerning—freedom of speech is another example. There is a whole body of doctrine dealing with that, and that’s objective and you would look to that and you would reason by analogy from the precedents that are in existence.

There is tension because our system of government is fundamentally a democratic system, as I said. The authority to make the basic policy decisions that affect people’s lives, most of them, most of those decisions are to be made by the legislature and by the Executive in carrying out the law. But the judiciary has the responsibility to exercise the power of judicial review. And so if something comes up that violates the Constitution, then it’s been established now going all the way back to Marbury v. Madison, if that comes up in a case, it is the duty of the judiciary to say what the law is and to enforce the law in that decision, and if that means saying that something that another branch of government has done is unconstitutional, then that’s what the judiciary has to do.

I would look to the text of the provision. I would look to anything that sheds light on what that would have been understood to mean. I would look to precedent, and as I mentioned a minute ago, I think in most of the areas now where constitutional issues come up with some frequency, there is a body of precedent. That would be—that shapes the decision. That’s generally what is going to dictate the outcome in the case, and if it’s a new question, then usually the judiciary will see where it fits into the body of precedent and reason by analogy from prior precedents.

Judges don’t have the authority to change the Constitution. The whole theory of judicial review that we have, I think is contrary to that notion. The Constitution is an enduring document and the Constitution doesn’t change. It does contain some important general principles that have to be applied to new factual situations that come up. But in doing that, the judiciary has to be very careful not to inject its own views into the matter. It has to apply the principles that are in the Constitution to the situations that come before the judiciary.

Well, I think that if the courts do the job that they are supposed to do, they will produce, we will produce a more just society. I think if you take a position as a Federal judge, you have to have faith that if you do your job, then you will be helping to create a more just society. The Constitution and the constitutional system that we have is designed to produce a just society.It gives different responsibilities to different people. You could think of a football team or you could think of an orchestra whereeverybody has a different part to play, and the whole system won’t work if people start playing—start performing the role of someone else. Everyone in the system has to perform their role, and I think you have to have faith, and I think it’s a well-grounded faith, that if you do that, if the judiciary does what it is supposed to do, the whole system will work toward producing a more just society.

Well, I don’t know exactly what Justice Souter was referring to when he said that, but just speaking for myself, I think that it is our job to interpret and to enforce the statutes that Congress passes and not to add to those statutes and not to take away from those statutes.

I think that the judiciary should decide the case— I think judges should decide the case that is before them. I think it’s hard enough to do that and get it right. If judges begin to go further and announce—and decide questions that aren’t before them, or issue opinions or statements about questions that aren’t before them—from my personal experience, what happens when you do that is that you magnify the chances of getting something wrong. When you have an actual concrete case of controversy before you, focus on that. It improves your ability to think through the issue and it focuses your thinking on the issue and it makes for a better decision if you just focus on the matter that is at hand and what you have to decide and not speak more broadly.If you speak more broadly, I think there is a real chance of saying something that you don’t mean to say, or suggesting something that you don’t mean to say and deciding questions before they have been fully presented to you, before you have heard all the arguments about this other question that isn’t really central to the case that is before you.

Courts do not have the authority to repeal statutes or to amend statutes, and so once a court has determined what a statute means, then it’s the obligation of the courts to enforce that statute. Now, sometimes when a case of statutory interpretation comes before a court and your first look at the statute seems to produce an absurd result, let’s say, or a very unjust result, then I think the judiciary has the obligation to go back and say, well, is this really what the statute means, because the legislature generally is not going to want to produce a result like that. So maybe our first look at this statute has produced an interpretation that’s it’s an incorrect statute. So I think we have to do that.And occasionally, a statute will come along or an administrative regulation will come along and the way it’s applied in a particular case shows that there’s a problem with the statute or the regulation that maybe Congress didn’t anticipate or the administrative agency didn’t anticipate. And in those instances, while I think it is the obligation of the judiciary to apply the statute that is before the judiciary, I think it is proper for us to say, look, this shows how this statute or this regulation plays out in the real world in this situation and maybe you didn’t think about that and maybe that’s something that you want to take into account if you’re going to revise the statute or issue a new regulation. I think those are proper roles for us.

Results-oriented jurisprudence is never justified because it is not our job to try to produce particular results. We are not policymakers and we shouldn’t be implementing any sort of policy agenda or policy preferences that we have.

I think the branches are co-equal and I think that the judiciary as a whole, including the Supreme Court, must always be mindful of the role that it is supposed to play in our system of government. It has an important role to play, but it’s a limited role and it has to do what it is supposed to do vigilantly, but it also has to be equally vigilant about not stepping over the bounds and invading the authority of Congress or invading the au-thority of the Executive or other government officials whose actions may be challenged. I think the challenge for the judiciary.

Senator, I don’t believe that I was, and when it was mentioned that Senator Bradley had withdrawn from a magazine, that didn’t ring any bells for me. I did not recall anything like that.

Well, this case was one of quite a few that we get that are on the line, and I think when you think about the nature of the appellate system, it stands to reason that it is going to work out that way. The really strong cases tend to settle; the really weak cases are either dismissed and not appealed, or they settle for modest amounts. So the ones that are hotly contested on appeal tend to be the ones that are close to the line, whatever the legal standard is.Now, four Federal judges looked at the facts in this case. One was Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who was then the district court judge and is now one of my colleagues on the Third Circuit. I was one. And we thought the evidence was not quite sufficient. And then my colleague, Theodore McKee, and Judge Green, a district court judge from Philadelphia, a fine district court judge, sitting by designation, thought that the evidence was sufficient. And I think that division illustrates this was a factual case on which reasonable people would disagree. This was a case in which there was no direct evidence of discrimination, and I could not agree with you more that we can’t stop there. There are subtle forms of discrimination, and the judicial process has to be attentive to the fact that discrimination exists and today a lot of it is driven underground.But all there was in this case were—all that the plaintiff could point to to show that there were facts from which you could infer discrimination were a very—what looked like a really minor violation of the company’s internal practices. They had a policy under which if somebody was being considered for a promotion, they would interview that person and they would decide we are going to promote or we are not going to promote. And if they decided they were not going to promote, then they were supposed to tell that person, ‘‘We’ve decided we’re not going to promote you,’’ before they go on to interviewing the next person. And in this instance, it appeared that they interviewed Ms. Bray, and they decided they weren’t going to promote her. And then they interviewed the other candidate, Ms. Real, before they told Ms. Bray that they weren’t going to promote her.There was no—they had nothing to gain by doing that. So it is a fact to be considered—

Well, I think you make a good point, Senator, but in this instance, my recollection is—and, in fact, I am quite sure of this. These were both people who were from the inside. They were both Marriott employees. And I think they were both being considered for the position at the time. So it wasn’t an instance in which they interviewed Ms. Bray and then they said, ‘‘Well, she is qualified, but we really don’t want to hire her. Let’s keep looking.’’If there had been evidence to that effect, then I would certainly think for the reasons that you’ve outlined that you could draw a pretty substantial inference of an intent to discriminate from that.

But nothing like that was presented to us in that case, as I remember it. 

Well, my thinking was that the standard we were to apply was could a reasonable jury find that discrimination was proven here. And it was my view and it was the view of the district judge that a reasonable jury couldn’t find that. The district judge actually looked at the qualifications of the two candidates and said, ‘‘This isn’t even close. Ms. Real is much better qualified than Ms. Bray.’’Now, I didn’t say that and I didn’t think that. I thought that they had somewhat different qualifications, and a reasonable person could view it either way. But there just wasn’t anything that I saw that a reasonable person could point to as a basis for a reasonable inference of an intent to discriminate.

Well, this case concerned an issue that had really divided the courts of appeals at the time when our court addressed it. And the courts of appeals—this gets into a fairly technical question involving a Supreme Court case called the McDonnell Douglas case. But to put it in simple terms, the courts of appeals have divided into three camps on this. There was the pretext-plus camp, which was the one that was the least hospitable to claims by employees. There was the pretext-only camp, which was the camp that was most favorable to employees. And there was the middle camp. And my position was in the middle camp, and when the issue went to the Supreme Court—and it did a couple of years later—in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing, Justice O’Connor wrote the opinion for the Supreme Court, and she agreed with my analysis of this legal issue, that in most instances pretext is sufficient. In fact, in the vast majority of instances if the plaintiff can show or could point to enough evidence to show that the reason given by the employer is a pretext, is incorrect, then that is enough to go to the jury. In the vast majority of cases, that is sufficient, but not in every case, and that is what I said in Sheridan and that is what Justice O’Connor said when she wrote the opinion for the Supreme Court in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing. 

Well, Senator, I think the vote on my court was a reflection of the standard that they applied and they did not apply the Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing standard. Of course, Reeves hadn’t been decided at that point, but they applied the standard that said if the plaintiff can create a fact issue as to whether it was pretextual, then that alone is sufficient. So they didn’t get into an evaluation of the sort of evidentiary points that you were mentioning.

They did. 

Yes, certainly, Senator. As I understand the concept, it is the concept that the President is the head of the Executive branch. The Constitution says that the President is given the Executive power and the idea of the unitary Executive is that the President should be able to control the Executive branch, however big it is or however small it is, whether it is as small as it was when George Washington was President or whether it is as big as it is today or even bigger. It has to do with control of whatever the Executive is doing. It doesn’t have to do with the scope of Executive power. It does not have to do with whether the Executive power that the President is given includes a lot of unnamed powers or what is often called inherent power. So it is the issue—it is the difference between scope and control. And as I understand the idea of the unitary Executive, it goes just to the question of control. It doesn’t go to the question of scope. 

Right. 

I think it is an opportunity for me to serve the country using whatever talent I have. I think that the courts have a very important role to play, but it is a limited role. So it is important for them to do a good job of doing what they are supposed to do, but also not to try to do somebody else’s job.And I think that this is an area for—this is a way in which I can make a contribution to the country and to society. I have tried to do that on the court of appeals and I would continue to do that if I am confirmed for the Supreme Court.

I don’t think that foreign law is helpful in interpreting the Constitution. Our Constitution does two basic things. It sets out the structure of our Government and it protects fundamental rights. The structure of our Government is unique to our country, and so I don’t think that looking to decisions of supreme courts of other countries or constitutional courts in other countries is very helpful in deciding questions relating to the structure of our Government.As for the protection of individual rights, I think that we should look to our own Constitution and our own precedents. Our country has been the leader in protecting individual rights. If you look at what the world looked like at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights, there were not many that protected human—in fact, I don’t think there were any that protected human rights the way our Bill of Rights did.We have our own law, we have our own traditions, we have our own precedents, and we should look to that in interpreting our Constitution. There are other legal issues that come up in which I think it is legitimate to look to foreign law. For example, if a question comes up concerning the interpretation of a treaty that has been entered into by many countries, I don’t see anything wrong with seeing the way the treaty has been interpreted in othercountries. I wouldn’t say that that is controlling, but it is something that is useful to look to.In private litigation, it is often the case—I have had cases like this in which the rule of decision is based on foreign law. There may be a contract between parties and the parties will say this contract is to be governed by the laws of New Zealand or wherever. So, of course, there, you have to look to the law of New Zealand or whatever the country is.So there are situations in litigation that come up in Federal court when it is legitimate to look to foreign law, but I don’t think it is helpful in interpreting our Constitution.

Well, what I was referring to were the efforts of Federal judges, lower Federal court judges in the South during the days after the decision in Brown v. Board of Education to try to implement that historic decision, despite enormous public resistance at times. But they—this was an example of the Federal judiciary not swaying in the wind of public opinion. There was a lot of opposition and I am sure that it didn’t make them popular.I have read a number of books concerning the situation in which they found themselves, but on the whole they behaved—they did what a Federal judge is supposed to do, which is that they enforced the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that, after a long delay, vindicated what the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment was supposed to mean, which was to guarantee equal rights to people of all races.

Well, there were some examples cited earlier today when the courts said that the Executive had overstepped the bounds of its authority. The Youngstown Steel case was cited, and that is certainly an example where President Truman thought that it was necessary to seize the steel mills so as not to interfere with the war effort in Korea. But the Supreme Court said that this was an overstepping of the bounds of Executive authority.There was a reference to United States v. Nixon where the Supreme Court said that the President of the United States had to comply with grand jury subpoena for documents and they stood up for what they understood the law to mean, despite the fact that there must have been great pressure against them in another di-rection. So when situations like that come up, it is the responsibility of the judiciary to hold fast.

Thank you very much, Senator. 

I don’t know, Senator. I tried to rack my memory about that, but as I said, if I had been active in my membership, I think I certainly would have remembered that, and if I had renewed the membership, I think I would remember that. So my best reconstruction of this is that it probably was sometime around the time when I wrote that statement.

That’s correct. 

I think that’s exactly right, Senator. Often there are conflicting freedoms and that makes the case difficult. 

Certainly, Senator. I have tried to decide every case on its own merits, and sometimes that means siding with the Government, and sometimes it means siding with the party who’s claiming a violation of rights, and I do it on an individual basis. Cases that show that I do that are cases like United States v. Kithcart, which was a case in which an African-American man had been stopped by police officers because he was—because there had been a description of some robbery suspects, and they had been described as—the perpetrator was described as a black man in a black car, and Mr. Kithcart was a black man in a black car. And they thought that was sufficient to stop the car, and I wrote an opinion saying that that was insufficient, and that was basically racial profiling and was not permitted.Another example is Bolden v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which had to do with a drug test, and I found that the test there constituted a search and a seizure and would be a violation absent consent on the part of the party who was searched. There have been a number of criminal cases in which I’ve sided with the person claiming a violation of rights. Carpenter v. Vaughn was a case in which I wrote an opinion reversing a death— I joined an opinion reversing a death penalty. The Bronshtein case was another case that came up fairly recently in which I joined an opinion reversing a death penalty. There have been quite a few cases of this nature, Senator.

I do. That was the case in which there was a search of a—I believe it was the office of a veterinarian, and in away that is a similar case to the Mellott case that I was discussing earlier, although in Mellott I thought that the search was carried out properly. In the Leveto case, on the facts of that case, I thought the search was not carried out properly, that the officers violated the Fourth Amendment in the way they went about carrying out that search. They forced the occupants of these premises to remain on the premises for a very extended period of time while the search was being conducted, and violated their Fourth Amendment rights, and that’s what I said in the opinion.

I think it’s well over 4,000 on the merits. 

That’s correct, Senator. 

Yes, Senator, that is correct. 

No, it’s not accurate. 

There was the case of Goosby v. Johnson & Johnson, and that case could be considered together with the Bray case that I was discussing before the break. Those were both cases in which my colleague, Judge McKee wrote the opinion, and in the Goosby case I agreed with him. It was a similar case, but it was a case where I thought the facts fell on the other side of the line. There was a case called Smith v. Davis, which was another case where I joined an opinion upholding the claim of an African-American who was claiming racial discrimination. The Robinson case involved claims of race and gender discrimination, as I recall. There are a number of cases in the criminal law context. I just mentionedthe Kithcart case. There was the Brinson case. There was Williams v. Price. There have been many cases involving other forms of discrimination, age discrimination, the Showalter case; disability case, the Mondzelewski case; the case of Shapiro v. Lakewood Township. There was Zubi v. AT&T, which was a case involving the statute of limitations for a claim of racial discrimination.

I was the dissenter in that case. 

My position was that—the majority’s position was that the claim had to be thrown out because the statute of limitations had been violated, and my position was that the claim should be allowed to go forward because the statute of limitations was longer than the majority had recognized. And that case—that issue later went to the Supreme Court in a case called Jones v. Donnelley and the Supreme Court agreed with my position, that the longer statute of limitations applied. 

That’s right, Senator. 

That’s certainly correct, Senator. 

My position in Rybar was really a very modest position, and it did not go to the question of whether Congress can regulate the possession of machine guns. In fact, I explained in the opinion that it would be easy for Congress to do that in a couple of ways that differed from the way in which it was done in Rybar.The statute in Rybar was very similar to the statute that was at issue in Lopez. In fact, I think they are the only two Federal firearm statutes that have been cast in that mold. They simply prohibited the possession of firearms without either congressional findings concerning the effect of the activity on interstate commerce, or a jurisdictional element. And I knew from my experience as a Federal prosecutor that most of the Federal firearms statutes have a jurisdictional element right in the statute. What that means is that when the prosecutor presents the case in court, the statute that is used most frequently is the statute that makes it a crime for someone who’s been convicted of a felony to possess a firearm.And in that case, when the prosecutor presents the case in court, the prosecutor has to show that the defendant has been convicted of a felony, and that the firearm in question had some connection with interstate commerce.Under Supreme Court precedent, a case called Scarborough, all that’s necessary is to show that the firearm, at some point in its history, passed an interstate or foreign commerce, was manufactured in one State and then later turned up in another State, or manufactured in a foreign country and brought to the United States.From my experience, this was never a practical problem, and this was how all the Federal firearms statutes had been framed. But for whatever reasons, the statute in Lopez and the statute in Rybar were lacking that jurisdictional element. So an easy way in would Congress could regulate the possession of a machine gun would be to insert a jurisdictional element. And as I pointed out, as I just pointed out, in my experience as the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, that was never a practical problem.The Supreme Court in Lopez said that there were three reasons why there was a problem with the statute there, and that case had been decided just the year before. And it was my obligation as a lower-court judge to follow it. The first was that it involved what the Court characterized as the noncommercial activity, and that was the possession of a firearm. And, of course, that was exactly the same activity that was at issue in Rybar. The second was the absence of a jurisdictional element, and there was no jurisdictional element in either statute. And the third was the absence of a con-gressional finding connecting the activity that was being regulated with interstate commerce. And I pointed out in my opinion that I would have viewed the Rybar case very differently if there had been a congressional finding, or if the Justice Department, in presenting its argument to us, had been able to point to anything that showed that there was a substantial effect on interstate commerce, which is what the Supreme Court says is required.

That’s exactly correct. 

I think that the Constitution contains both some very specific provisions, and there the job of understanding what the provision means and applying it to new factual situations that come up is relatively easy. The Constitution sets age limits, for example, for people who want to hold various Federal offices, and there can’t be much debate about what that means or how it applies. But it also contains some broad principles—no unreasonable searches and seizures, the guarantee that nobody will be deprivedof life, liberty, or property without due process of law, equal protection of the laws. And in those instances, it is the job of the judiciary to try to understand the principle and apply it to the new situations that come before the judiciary.I think the judiciary has to do that in a neutral fashion. I think judges have to be wary about substituting their own preferences, their own policy judgments for those that are in the Constitution. They have to identify the principle that is to be applied under these broader provisions of the Constitution and apply it, but I don’t see that as being the same thing as the judge’s injecting his or her policy views or preferences or ideas about the direction in which the society should be moving into the decisionmaking process.

Well, Senator, I would never say that it is an easy process. There are some easy cases, but there are a lot of very difficult cases. And once you have identified the principle, the job of applying it to particular cases is often not easy at all. But what the judge has to do is make sure that the judge is being true to the principle that is expressed in the Constitution and not to the judge’s principle, not to some idea that the judge has. And sometimes this results in ground-breaking decisions. Sometimes that is because new issues come up. Sometimes it is because the principle that is embodied in a constitutional provision has long been neglected.That was certainly true with respect to the Equal Protection Clause. There was a long period between Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education when the true meaning of the Equal Protection Clause was not recognized in the decisions of the Supreme Court, and when Brown was finally decided, that was not an instance of the Court changing the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. It was an instance of the Court righting an incorrect interpretation that had prevailed for a long period of time.

Senator, when I made that statement in 1988, I was an appointee in the Reagan administration, and Judge Bork had been a nominee of the administration, and I had been a supporter of the nomination. And I don’t think the statement goes beyond that.There are issues with respect to which I probably agree with Judge Bork, and there are a number of issues on which I disagree with him. And most of the things that you just mentioned are points on which I would disagree with him. I expressed my view about Griswold earlier this morning. On the issue of reapportionment, as I sit here today in 2006—and I think that is what is most relevant—I think that the principle of one person/one vote is a fundamental part of our constitutional law. And I think it would be— I don’t see any reason why it should be re-examined, and I don’t know that anybody is asking for that to be done. Every legislative district in the country and every congressional district in the country has been reapportioned, has been redistricted numerous times in reliance on the principle of one person/one vote. And the old ways of organizing State legislatures have long been forgotten. So I think that is very well settled now in the constitutional law of our country.Under the Fourth Amendment, I have no question about the decision in United States v. United States District Court, which held—and I think that is what you were referring to, which held that a warrant is required for domestic security surveillance, and that was the decision that led to the enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

I was, and that was in—I saw that quoted in the paper yesterday. I think that was in 19—

I was a supporter of the nominee of the administration, and he was the nominee of the administration. He was and is an accomplished scholar. He had contributed a great deal to constitutional debate with his writings. But I don’t agree with him on a number of issues, and I mentioned—you hit some of the issues on which I would definitely disagree with him. 

Well, Senator, I am happy to address that. The statement was made in that 1985 form, and, of course, that was written 20 years ago. And in the form, what I was doing was sort of outlining the development of my thinking about constitutional law, and I went so far as to go back to my college days, which were before, of course, I had even attended law school, much less practiced law or served as a judge. I mentioned some of the leading areas that were covered by decisions of the Warren Court, and the decisions of the Warren Court really stimulated my interest in constitutional law. And I mentioned a book that had been published the time, Alexander Bickel’s book ‘‘The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress,‘‘ which was probably the first book about what you might call constitutional theory that I had read. And he was someone who I think most people would describe as a liberal, but he was a critic of the Warren Court for a number of reasons. And he was a great proponent of judicial self-restraint, and that was the main point that I took from my pre-law school study of the Warren Court. I spoke a bit about the reapportionment decisions. I don’t believe that I—in fact, I am quite sure I never was opposed to the one person/one vote concept. I do recall quite clearly that my father’s work at the time working for the New Jersey Legislature and working on reapportionment had brought to my attention the question of just how far that principle of one person/one vote had to be taken in drawing legislative districts. The New Jersey Legislature and many other legislatures at the time were trying to redraw their districts in accordance with Reynolds v. Sims, which set out the one person/one vote principle. But it wasn’t clear how exactly equal the districts had to be in popu-lation. And in some of the late Warren Court decisions, the Court seemed to suggest—did say so for congressional districts that they had to be almost exactly equal in population. And this idea, if applied to the legislatures and to the New Jersey legislative plan, would have wiped the plan out because there were population deviations which, although not very large, were much larger than the Court had said they were going to tolerate in the case of congressional districts. And I do remember that quite specifically.Professor Bickel made the argument that the Court had taken the one person/one vote principle too far, and I know my father had said that although he thought it was a good idea, the idea of trying to get the districts to be exactly equal in population at the expense of looking at other factors, such as the shape of the district and respecting county lines or municipal lines, was a bad idea.

Well, again, I’m trying to remember what I thought about that 20 years ago, and I’m trying to reconstruct it.I think a traditional value that I probably had in mind was the ability to live in peace and safety in your neighborhood, and that was a big issue during the time of the Warren Court, and it was still a big issue in 1985 when I wrote that statement because that was a time of very high crime rates. I think that is a traditional value.I think the ability of people to raise a family and raise their children in accordance with their own beliefs is a traditional value. I think the ability to raise a family, raise children in a way that they are not only subjected to—they are spared physical threats but also psychological threats that can come from elements in the atmosphere is a traditional value. I think that the ability to practice your own conscience is a traditional value.That is the best I can reconstruct it now, thinking back to 1985. 

Trying to apply the undue burden test at that time to the provisions of the Pennsylvania statute that were before the court in Casey was extremely difficult, and I can really remember wrestling with the problem and I took it very seriously and I mentioned that in my opinion and it presented some really difficultissues. Part of the problem was that the law just was not very clear at that time.The undue burden standard had been articulated by Justice O’Connor in several of her own opinions and there were just a few hints in those opinions about what she meant by it. But what she said was that an undue burden consisted of an absolute obstacle or an extreme burden. Those may not be exact quotes, but they’re pretty close. And she did say that it was insufficient to show simply that a regulation of abortion would inhibit some women from going forward and having an abortion. Those were the—that was the information that was available in her opinions to try to understand what this test meant.And so then the question became, how do you apply that to the numerous provisions of the Pennsylvania statute that were before us, and it was a difficult task. The plaintiffs argued that all the provisions constituted an undue burden, and when the case went to the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens agreed with that. He said they all were an undue burden. Things like a 24-hour waiting period, that was an undue burden because it would inhibit some women from having an abortion. An informed consent provision, Justice Stevens thought and plaintiffs argued that would be an undue burden.The majority on my panel and the joint opinion on the Supreme Court found that most of the provisions of the statute did not amount to an undue burden, the 24-hour waiting period, the informed consent provision, and all of them. We disagreed on only one, and that was the provision regarding spousal notification with a safety valve provision there that no sort of notification was needed if the woman thought that providing the notification would present a threat of physical injury to her. And I wrestled with that issue, but based on the information that I had from Justice O’Connor’s opinions, it seemed to me that this was not what she had in mind. Now, that turned out not to be a correct prediction about how she herself would apply the undue burden standard to that statutory provision, but that was the best I could do under the circumstances.

Senator, I don’t believe that I disagreed with the principle of one person/one vote in 1985. I was talking about how I got interested in constitutional law back in college and I was certainly stimulated at that time by my consideration of the issue of one person/one vote. But the issue that troubled me toward the end of the Warren Court, and this was during the time when I was in college, was the question of how far this principle went when it came to drawing legislative districts. Did they have to be almost exactly equal in population in accordance with the last census, or were larger population variations permitted?In a case called Kirkpatrick v. Preisler and another one called Wells v. Rockefeller that were decided around 1969, which was right at the end of Chief Justice Warren’s tenure on the Supreme Court, the Court held that in the case of congressional districts, they had to be almost exactly equal in population, and as I said, my father was deeply involved in this. When the issue came up again in the context of congressional districting in Carcher v. Daggett, which was around 1985, that was the case where he had been an expert witness and the Court struck down the New Jersey congressional districting plan even though the population variations were under 1 percent. Now, the Court also later said that when you’re talking about legislative districts, considerably larger deviations are allowed and you can take into account municipal lines and county lines and things of that nature.But as of the time when I was in college, as in the time of the two cases that I mentioned, it seemed likely—a lot of people thought, and certainly I as a college student thought that the rule was going to be the same for congressional districts as it was for legislative districts and that seemed to say that the districts would have to be almost exactly equal in population based on the last census.Now, a problem with that is that while the census is very accurate, it’s not perfect and it doesn’t stay accurate throughout the 10year period from census to census. People move around. The population grows. The population diminishes in certain areas. So it didn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense, let’s say in the middle of a decade, to insist on absolute population equality based on the last previous census when everybody knew that the census figures had changed, and in doing that, in insisting on practically equal population districts, districts of almost exactly equal population, you disregard municipal lines, you disregard county lines. People don’t know which district they’re going to be voting in. You introduce the possibility of other factors figuring into the districting plan.

Well, Senator, I’m happy to address that because I think there’s been some confusion about what the issue was in Chittister and how it relates to the Supreme Court’s decision in Nevada v. Hibbs, and they’re actually two entirely different provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act.The provision that was at issue in my case was not the one in Hibbs and at last count, seven circuits had decided that issue, the issue that was before my court in Chittister, exactly the same way we did. I counted up the number of Court of Appeals judges who endorsed that position and it’s over 20. I think it’s 22. And they include some of the most distinguished Court of Appeals judges in the country and judges who have been appointed by Presidents of both parties.The issue in Hibbs had to do with a provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act that requires employers to provide employees with a certain amount of leave for the purpose of taking care of another family member. The provision—and that was the one that the Supreme Court addressed in the Hibbs case. The provision in the Chittister case is a provision that requires employers to give employees a certain amount of leave for personal illness. The standard that has to be applied here is the one the Supreme Court has set out, and it’s a controversial standard, but as a lower court judge, it’s the one I had to apply, and that was whether what was done was congruent and proportional to constitutional violations.What the Court said in Hibbs was that there was a record of constitutional violations, and remember, here we’re talking about the provision that has to do with leave to take care of another person, and what they said was that there were many instances in which employers, State employers, had plans that provided more leave for that purpose for women than for men and the reason was because of the stereotype that if somebody in the family got sick, it would be the woman, not a man, who would have to take off from work to take care of that person.But the provision that was at issue in Chittister had to do with leave for one’s own personal illness and there was no record that employers give—and a man was subjected to this, and there was no record that State employers, or for that matter any other employers, had plans that provided more sick leave for men than for women or that any stereotypes were involved in the situation. And so that was why I concluded, and the unanimous panel that I sat on concluded, and all of these seven other circuits concluded thatthat provision did not satisfy the standard that the Supreme Court had established.

Well, Senator, I think you’re probably right and I hope you’re right that that sort of issue doesn’t come before the Supreme Court again. Some of the—the Equal Protection ground that the majority relied on in Bush v. Gore does involve principles that could come up in future elections and in future cases.But as to that particular case, my answer has to be, I really don’t know. I have not had the opportunity—I have not studied it in the way I would study a case that comes before me as a judge and I would have to go through the whole judicial process—

Well, there’s the issue of whether they should have taken it and the issue of how it should be decided, and Senator, my honest answer is I have not studied it in the way I would study the issue if it were to come before me as a judge and that would require putting out of my mind any personal thoughts that I had on the matter and thinking about the—listening to all the arguments and reading the briefs and thinking about it in the way that I do when I decide legal issues that are before me as a judge. That’s the only—that’s the best answer I can give you to that question. It was obviously a very important and difficult and controversial case, and in a situation like that, the obligation of a judge all the more is to be restrained and not to—is to go through the judicial decisionmaking process, and only at the end of that reach a conclusion about the issue.

I think that the judiciary should have great respect for findings of fact that are made by Congress. And in the Rybar decision that I was discussing earlier, although it is controversial and it involved an application of the Lopez decision, I stated that that decision would have been very different from—that case would have been very different for me if Congress had made findings, and that is because of two things.I am fully aware of the fact that the members of the judiciary are not the only officers in the United States who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Members of Congress take an oath to support the Constitution and officers of the Executive branch take an oath to support the Constitution, and I presume that they go about their work in good faith.The second point—and this goes directly to the issue of findings—is that the judiciary is not equipped at all to make findings about what is going on in the real world, not this sort of legislative findings. And Congress, of course, is in the best position to do that. You have constituents. Members of Congress hear from their constituents. Congress can have hearings and examine complex social issues, receive statistical data, hear testimony from experts, analyze that and synthesize that and reduce that to findings. And when Congress makes findings on questions that have a bearing on the constitutionality of legislation, I think they are entitled to great respect.

Yes, certainly, Senator. Well, I think you have pointed to the leading case in this area, and that is South Dakota v. Dole. South Dakota v. Dole recognizes that Congress has broad powers under the Spending Clause, and that when Congress provides money to the States, Congress can attach conditions to that money, to the receipt of the money, provided that certain standards are met.One thing that has to be done under the Supreme Court’s cases is that there has to be a clear statement that the conditions are attached to the receipt of the money. And the Supreme Court views this like a contract, so that the parties need to have—the party receiving the notice has to have clear and fair notice about what it is agreeing to by taking the money. And then beyond that, the condition—if that is satisfied, then the condition has to be germane to the purposes of the funds.And in South Dakota v. Dole, the Court found that the drinking age and the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit were germane to the purpose of the expenditures, and these, I believe, were Federal highway funds. So those are the standards that would be applied to any future legislation under the current precedents if the future legislation invokes Congress’s broad power under the Spending Clause.

Well, that’s a difficult issue for me to address from my current position as a judge of a court of appeals because the Supreme Court is my boss, and I am reluctant to suggest that I think they should be doubling their workload.[Laughter.] 

That’s not the sort of—or even increasing it at all. That’s not the sort of thing that subordinates generally do regarding superiors. But circuit splits are certainly undesirable, and I think everybody recognizes that, and that’s one of the grounds for granting certiorari. I know that when Justice White was on the Court he regularly would dissent from denial of certiorari in caseswhere there was a circuit split because he felt strongly that circuit splits should be resolved by the Supreme Court.I have friends, former colleagues from prior times in my career, who are appellate attorneys who specialize in cases before the Supreme Court and in appellate litigation generally, and occasionally I hear them complain about unresolved circuit splits that are difficult for their clients. So I’m aware of their complaints.I haven’t personally kept track of the number of circuit splits that exist, but certainly they are undesirable thing, and it is a ground for granting certiorari, and I think one of the jobs that the Supreme Court has is to iron out circuit splits. There can be disagreements about whether there really is a circuit split, obviously, in a particular case, and there can be differences of opinion about the timing for resolving circuit splits. Sometimes the Supreme Court thinks it’s advisable to wait and see how an issue plays out in a number of circuits before the Supreme Court decides to take on the issue, and that may improve their ability to resolve the issue when the case generally—when the case eventually comes before them.

I think that the problem of protecting children from pornography on the Internet illustrates the fact that although the task of the judiciary is to apply principles that are in the Constitution and not make up its own principles, to apply those to different factual situations when the world changes, and in particular, in the First Amendment context, when means of communication changes. The job of applying the principles that have been worked out—and I think in this area worked out with a great deal of effort over a period of time—in the pre-Internet world, applying those to the world of the Internet is a really difficult problem, and I understand it. Congress has been struggling with it, and I know the judiciary has been struggling with it.The law, of course, as you know, constitutional law draws a distinction between obscenity, which has no First Amendment protection but is subject to a very strict definition, and pornography, which is not obscenity but is sexually related materials, with respect to minors, the Supreme Court has said that it’s permissible for a State to regulate the sale of pornography to minors, has greater authority there. I think that’s the Ginsburg case. It has greater authority there than it does with respect to the distribution of pornography to adults.Now, in the pre-Internet world, the job of preventing minors from purchasing pornography was a lot simpler. If they wanted to get it, I guess they would have to go to a store or some place and buy it. But on the Internet, of course, it’s readily available from any computer terminal, and a lot of minors today are a lot more sophisticated in the use of computers than their parents, so the ability of parents to monitor what they’re doing and supervise what they’re doing is greatly impaired by this difference in computer aptitude. I can’t say much more about the question than that. It is a difficult question. I think that there needs to be additional effort in this area, probably by all branches of Government so that the law fully takes into account the differences regarding communication over the Internet and access to materials over the Internet by minors.

I have—I’m aware of the issue, but I have not thought past what might happen with these confirmation proceedings. So it’s not the kind of issue that I have really thought through in my mind. If I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed, I think I would assess the situation at that time and talk to the Supreme Court Justices and see what their views are, the reasons why they’re proceeding in one way or another.I know from my perspective as a lower court judge, that there is a constant conflict between the obligation that we have to deal with a very heavy caseload and the need for the judge, as opposed to a law clerk or a staff employee of the Court to deal with the cases. We cannot delegate our judicial responsibility, but we do need to call on—we need to find ways, and we do find ways, of using—of obtaining assistance from clerks and staff, employees, so that we can deal with the large caseload that we have.

Well, Senator that really relates to the next case in the Lopez-Morrison line of cases that might come before the Supreme Court, and so I don’t know how I can address that question without knowing what that case is, and of course, my resolution of it would— 

Well, Lopez is— 

Lopez is a precedent of the Court, and it’s been followed in Morrison, and then it has to be considered within connection with the Supreme Court’s decision in Raich, and I think that all three of those have to be taken into account together. I don’t think there’s any question at this point in our history that Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause is quite broad, and I think that reflects a number of things, including the way in which our economy and our society has developed, and all of the foreign and intrastate activity that takes place, we do still have a Federal system of Government, and I think most people believe that that is the system that’s set up by our Constitution. 

Well, what I said in the opinion and what I will reiterate this afternoon is that it would have been a very different case for me. I don’t think I can express an opinion on how I would have decided a hypothetical case.

And I read it like that. I think it would have been—

I don’t think that I can give you a definitive answer to the question because that involves a case that’s different from the case that came before me. But I repeat what I said there, it would have been a very different matter if Congress had made findings. I have the greatest respect for findings. This is an area where Congress has the expertise and where Congress has the opportunity to assemble facts and to assess the facts. We on the appellate judiciary don’t have that opportunity. So if Congress had made findings—and I didn’t insist on findings. If the Executive branch, which was defending the statute, had pointed to testimony at hearings—and that’s been done in other Commerce Clause cases—or statements by responsible Government officials with expertise in the area of firearms control, or any other evidence thatsubstantiated this, it would have been a very different case for me, and of course, if there had been a jurisdictional element, then I think it’s perfectly clear under the precedents that it would have been constitutional.

I meant that there are activities that—and I think there is general agreement on this, and it goes beyond what the Constitution requires into areas of policy that I think Congress respects. I think there is general agreement that there are some activities that have traditionally been handled by the States and by local governments. Those are areas in which they have taken the lead because the view has been that they are in the best position to deal with that. And that was the issue that was directly addressed by Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Lopez. He relied in large part on the fact that—he put heavy reliance on the fact that what was involved in Lopez was a law relating to schools. And although the Federal Government certainly has a role in education, traditionally that has been regarded as something that is primarily to be handled at the State and local level.

I agree that Lopez was a startling development for a lot of people. When I was in law school, I think the traditional wisdom was that the commerce power reached everything, that there was no limit to the power, that nothing could ever exceed the power. And Lopez and the Lopez line of cases have not made huge inroads on that principle, but it was the first time in a long time that a statute had been held to exceed Congress’s commerce power. So to that extent, yes, it was a revolution, but how big of a one—

I think that—I’d have to talk about individual cases, but I do think most of those are—the ones that come to my mind I think are well-settled precedents.

Well, in Chittister— 

I don’t, Senator. I don’t believe that there were congressional findings in Chittister that went to the issue in Chittister. 

Well, what the Supreme Court has said is that findings of fact are very helpful when they are provided. And the Court will certainly treat them with respect. But they are neither— they are not necessarily definitive, and they also are not necessary. Congress doesn’t have to make findings. It is helpful when it does it, and under the Supreme Court’s cases, the findings are not necessarily definitive. That is what the Supreme Court has said about this. 

Senator, I looked very carefully at all of the materials that were cited by the other judges in Rybar and that were provided by the Government. And the things that were cited from the legislative history of the prior statutes did not, in my view, go to the issue in Rybar. All of those prior statutes were statutes that had jurisdictional elements in them. All that I was looking for was some evidence that the possession of a machine gun—not the transfer of a machine gun or the sale of a machine gun, but the mere possession had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. That is what I understood the Supreme Court precedent to require. And it is not a very heavy burden to show that something has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but that is what I understood the Supreme Court precedent to require and that is what I was looking for. 

There are a number of factors that figure in the application of stare decisis in particular cases. There are factors that weigh in favor of stare decisis, and there are factors that weigh against stare decisis. Factors that weigh in favor of stare decisis arethings like what the initial vote was on the case, the length of time that the case has been on the book, whether it has been reaffirmed, whether it has been reaffirmed on stare decisis grounds, whether there has been reliance, the nature and the extent of the reliance, whether the precedent has proven to be workable. Those are all factors that have to be considered on an individual basis.

Well, I think what needs to be done is a consideration of all of the factors that are relevant. This is not a mathematical formula. It would be a lot easier for everybody if it were. But it is not. The Supreme Court has said that this is a question that calls for the exercise of judgment. They have said there has to be a special justification for overruling a precedent. There is a presumption that precedents will be followed. But it is not—the rule of stare decisis is not an inexorable command, and I don’t think anybody would want a rule in the area of constitutional law that pointed in that—that said that a constitutional decision, once handed down, can never be overruled.So it’s a matter of weighing all of the—taking into account all of the factors and seeing whether there is a strong case based on all the relevant—

I am sorry, Senator. 

Well, Roe has—sorry. 

Senator, I’m sorry if I didn’t understand your question previously. One situation in which there is a special justification for overruling a precedent is if the rule has proven to be unworkable. An example where the Supreme Court thought that a rule had proven to be unworkable is provided by National League of Cities and San Antonio Transit Authority v. Garcia. National League of Cities asked whether something was traditionally a sovereign function. And that resulted in a whole series of cases in the lower courts, a large number of cases in the lower courts, and a number of cases in the Supreme Court in which the courts had to decide whether something was on one side of this line or not, and it proved in the view of the Supreme Court to be a very difficult standard to work with. And, finally, in Garcia, they said this is unworkable, and we are going to overrule National League of Cities, and we are going to leave it to Congress to deal with the federalism issue that is presented here. This is an example of the Supreme Court saying there is a federalism concern here, but it is one that Congress rather than the Court would have to deal with.Sometimes changes in the situation in the real world can call for the overruling of a precedent. An example of that is provided by Katz v. United States, which I was talking about this morning in relation to wiretapping. The old rule under Olmstead was that in order for there to be a search, you had to look to property law. You had to see whether there was an invasion of a property interest. And then with the development of electronic communications and electronic surveillance, wiretapping or other forms of electronic surveillance, which is what was involved in Katz, the Supreme Court said this isn’t a sensible way to apply the Fourth Amendment principle under the conditions of the modern world, and they said famously that the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. So they shifted—they found the doctrinal underpinnings of the old Olmstead rule to be undermined by developments in the society, and they shifted the focus from property law to whether somebody had an expectation of privacy.So those are examples. 

I did say that. The 14th Amendment protects liberty. The Fifth Amendment protects liberty. And I think it is well accepted that this has a substantive component, and that that component includes aspects of privacy that have constitutional protection. 

Well, I mentioned the fact in my opinion that this provision applied only to married women, but I don’t think that was really the focus of what I was getting at. I think—and I agree with her that you look at the group that’s affected, not the group that’s unaffected, and the standard that she had—so that would be women who fell within this provision of the Pennsylvania law. And the standard that she had articulated in the earlier cases was, as I described it a couple of minutes ago, that an undue burden in her view had to be an absolute obstacle or an extreme obstacle, and it could not be simply something that inhibited some women. The ‘‘some women’’ phrase was her phrase, not my phrase. 

I never equated the situation of an adult woman who fell within the notification provision of the Pennsylvania statute with the situation of a minor who was required to provide notice. There is an analogy, and the earlier case that Justice O’Connor had decided, the Hodgson case, was a minor notification stat-ute. But I think I made it quite clear in my opinion that this was nothing more than an analogy and that there was no close—these situations were very distinct, and I was aware of that, and I think I pointed that out.

Well, I think that the case law is very clear about protecting the life and the health of the mother is the compelling interest throughout pregnancy. I think that’s very clear in the case law.

Well, I think there are two things that I should say in response to that. The first is that I did not advocate in the memo that an argument be made that Roe be overruled, and therefore, the whole issue, had the Government proceeded with the argument that I recommended, the issue of stare decisis wouldn’t have been presented and so there wasn’t any occasion for me to talk about stare decisis in the memo and I did not talk about it. I think there’s a mention of it in a footnote. So I didn’t address it and there wasn’t an occasion to address it. The second thing I would say is that stare decisis is a concern for the judiciary much more than it is for an advocate. An advocate is trying to achieve a result, and so an advocate is—for an advocate, stare decisis can be either a great benefit if it is in your favor or an obstacle to get over. But it isn’t the kind of issue that needs to be grappled with in the way in which a court has to grapple with stare decisis. 

Well, Senator, I don’t—I do not equate the situation of a married woman with the situation of a minor—

Well, I think if you look at the words, I actually said that I don’t equate these two situations. I was mindful of the fact that they are very different situations. But often, the law proceeds on the basis—legal reasoning is based on analogy, and so if you take a situation that’s quite different and yet has some relationship to a situation that comes up later, you can draw some analogies while still recognizing that the two situations are very different.If you’re talking about the potential for abuse, that certainly is something that can come up in either of these two contexts and it’s a tragedy in either context. If a single minor is abused as a result of notification, that’s a tragedy. If a single adult woman is abused as a result of notification, it’s a tragedy.But what I think I’m getting at there is that this is what we had. This is what I had. This was the information that I had to work with to try to understand what this provision meant. And so you work with what you’ve got and that’s what I had and I was trying to see to what degree the prior situation was relevant and to what degree it wasn’t relevant to the issue that was before me.

I think that what I was addressing when I said that was what the Fourth Amendment means, the general principle that is set out in the Fourth Amendment, and the case law under the Fourth Amendment says that a warrant is generally required, but there are well-recognized situations in which a search can be carried out without a warrant. Exigent circumstances is a situation that comes immediately to mind if—

I do— 

Yes, Senator, I recognize that and I think that’s a very useful framework for addressing issues of Executive power. Now, there is a question about what the meaning of what Congress did, and that would be a statutory question. What is the meaning of the provision of FISA in question, and maybe there’s no substantial argument about what was meant there, but maybe there would be an issue about what was meant there, and certainly there could be an issue about the meaning of the authorization on the use of military force. How far was that intended to go? And so the statutory question, I think, would—that certainly would be an issue that could come up in this situation and probably you would need to—I think you would have to resolve the statutory question before you could figure out which of the three categories that Justice Jackson set out the case fell into. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, certainly, Senator. We have an adversary system and that means that both sides get the opportunity to presenttheir arguments, and we have established judicial procedures and they are time consuming and they are burdensome and maybe some people would say that some of them are old fashioned. But I think they work well and they are designed to make sure that there’s the vigorous presentation of both sides of the issue that is presented in the case at hand, not some abstract issue that might be addressed in a law review article or a broad issue that might be addressed in a piece of legislation, but an actual concrete case, a dispute between real parties that comes before the court. Both sides have the opportunity to present the arguments that they think have a bearing on that case. The judges get the opportunity to read the briefs, and then in—

That’s correct. 

That’s correct. 

Well, we receive briefs and the briefs are well thought out by the attorneys and it provides, if the case is well briefed, a strong presentation of the positions on both sides of the question, and if it’s an issue of great public importance, there may be other people who file briefs, so called friends of the court. On the Supreme Court now these days, they get a lot of those on both sides of many of the big issues that come before them. So that ensures that they have a strong presentation of all the arguments that can be made on both sides of the issue, both sides of the case. The first step in the process would be to read all of those and then there would be an oral argument. At that point, the Justices of the Supreme Court or the judges of my court— 

That’s right, and— 

You shouldn’t. I think very often, I come into an oral argument with a tentative idea about how the case should be decided. I’ve thought through the issue as much as I can, but my mind is open to the possibility that something will happen during the oral argument or later in my discussion with the other judges that might change my mind. So we have the oral argument and the lawyers will make their presentation. In that situation, I have the opportunity to ask questions, unlike today. That’s a better situation to be in, but it gives me a chance to explore the issues in the case that are troubling to me and I can pose hypotheticals to the lawyers and try to explore how far their arguments go.And after we have the argument, the judges get together in what’s known as the conference. That’s a private meeting when just the judges are present. And we each discuss the case, and very often one of my colleagues will say something that makes me think about the case differently than I did going into the conference. But at the end of the conference, if we’ve all voted, then we exchange our views and we come to a conclusion about how a case should be decided.And it’s only at the end of that process that we actually have a vote on the decision, and then somebody is given the job of writing an opinion and sometimes things even change during the opinion writing process. There have been numerous cases in which I’ve had the opinion and I’ve been given the job of writing an opinion to affirm and in the process of—or the reverse, and in the process of writing the opinion, I see that the position that I had previously was wrong. I changed my mind. And then I will write to the other members of the panel and I will say, I have thought this through and this is what I discovered and now I think we should do the opposite of what we agreed, and sometimes they’ll agree with me and sometimes they won’t.So it’s a long process and it’s only at the end of that whole process that I think a judge is in the position, when the opinion is actually going to be issued, the judge is in the position to say, now I’ve done everything I can with this and this is how I analyze the issue.

That’s an important part of the legal process. If anybody has sat on a jury, they’ve probably been instructed by the judge not to reach any conclusions about the case until they’ve heard all the evidence, not to reach premature conclusions, and judges have the same obligation. Now, it doesn’t mean you don’t think about things. You do think about them, but you don’t reach your final conclusion until you’ve gone through this entire process.

I can, Senator. I would do that to the best of my ability. That is what I’ve tried to do on the court of appeals, and if I’m confirmed, that’s what I would do on the Supreme Court.

Yes, Senator. Certainly. Well, let me start with the Constitution. The Constitution gives the legislative branch certain powers, and they’re enumerated in the Constitution. One of those powers is the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and a great deal of legislation that Congress passed during the 20th century was regulation that was based on its power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and many of the criminal statutes that Congress has passed, the Federal criminal statutes, are based on Congress’s power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.So it’s necessary for each of these statutes to fall within this power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and one of the ways of ensuring that each exercise of this power falls within Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause is to require that the jurisdictional element be proven in the case. In the case of firearms, as I mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court has said it’s enough to show that the firearm at some point in its history traveled in interstate and foreign commerce, and my experience as a U.S. Attorney and before that as an Assistant U.S. Attorney was that this is not a difficult burden for prosecutors to meet. I can’t recall a case during the time I was U.S. Attorney where anybody expressed the slightest problem with satisfying this. So this is a very simple way of satisfying the interstate commerce element in the case of firearms offenses.

That is correct. 

And that’s the Thornburgh case that you’re referring to, Senator. 

Yes. It wasn’t a brief. It was a memorandum about whether the government should file a brief as a friend of the court. 

Yes, that’s correct. 

That was the express position of President Reagan himself. He had spoken on the issue and he had written on the issue. 

Well, I was doing what I thought my job was as an advocate, which was to outline the litigation strategy that would be in the best interests of my client, given what my client was interested in, and it seemed to me that the strategy that I recommended was the best strategy to be followed.

No, they did not. They argued that Roe v. Wade should be overruled and the Supreme Court rejected that— 

That is correct. That’s what I thought the law required. I thought we were required to defer to the Department of Health and Human Services’s interpretation of the statute and so that’s how I voted. And if I’d been out to implement some sort of agenda to strike down—to uphold any abortion regulation that came along, then I would not have voted the way I did in that Elizabeth Blackwell case. 

Yes, that’s correct. That was the statute. 

I do, all too well. [Laughter.] 

I actually don’t know exactly, no. 

I can. I’ve lived on a Federal judge’s salary up to this point. 

No, he can’t do that. That’s in—the Constitution says that, fortunately. Well, nobody can. The President certainly can’t and Congress can’t, either.[Laughter.] 

They can, yes. [Laughter.] 

Yes. Yes, it can. 

Yes. 

No. No. 

No, I don’t think that’s reviewable. 

There are certainly some things that are not reviewable. Vetoes are not reviewable. Pardons are not reviewable. 

That’s correct. 

Yes, I do. I don’t think that activism has anything to do with being a liberal or being a conservative. It has to do with not following the proper judicial role. It has to do with a judge’s substituting his or her own views for what the Constitution means and for what the laws mean. 

No, I think that’s been settled since Marbury v. Madison back at the beginning of the 19th century, that when a case is presented to the Supreme Court and there is a questionraised about the constitutionality of a statute and the Court concludes that the statute is unconstitutional, it’s the obligation of the Court to follow the Constitution and not the statute.

That’s exactly correct. The judiciary should do what it is supposed to do, but it has to have respect for the political process. And our constitutional system sets up a Government under which most of the decisions, the policy decisions, the things that affect people in their daily lives—the spending of money, taxing, decisions about foreign policy, and many other areas—are to be made by the political branches of the Government, and the judiciary’s role is confined to enforcing the Constitution and enforcing the laws and not going beyond that. 

I don’t. I don’t think that it’s very helpful—in fact, I don’t think it is helpful to look at the decisions of foreign courts for the interpretation of our Constitution. I think we can do very well with our own Constitution and our own judicial precedents and our own traditions. And I don’t say that with disrespect to the other countries. But I don’t think that there are insights to be provided on issues of American constitutional law by examining the decisions of foreign courts. I think that it’s very interesting from a political science perspective to see what they’ve done, and I’ve personally been interested in this over the years. And I think it’s flattering to us that so many other countries have followed our judicial traditions. But on issues of interpretation of our Constitution, I don’t think that that’s useful. 

I think that everybody who holds a public office under the Constitution has a solemn responsibility to follow the Constitution and the laws that define the role that that person, that officer is supposed to play. And I think that the continued success of our constitutional system and public respect for the constitutional system are dependent on people who have the public trust doing that, making a really strong effort to follow the provisions of the Constitution and other laws that define the role that they are supposed to play.

It was a State magistrate. 

That’s right, whether they were liable for money damages. And under the law, if they had a reasonable belief that they were authorized by the warrant to search people who were found on the premises, then they should not be liable for civil damages. The warrant had been—the warrant had incorporated the affidavit for purposes of establishing probable cause, and the officers had said in the affidavit that there is probable cause to believe that people on the premises may have drugs on their possession, and the magistrate judge had accepted that by incorporating the affidavit for purposes of probable cause. And under those circumstances, I thought that at a minimum it was reasonable for the officers to believe that the judicial officer, the magistrate, had said that they were to do exactly what they did. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, when you say regardless of what laws Congress passes, I think that puts us in that third category that Justice Jackson outlined, the twilight zone, where according to Justice Jackson, the President has whatever constitutional powers he has under—he possesses under Article II, minus what is taken away by whatever Congress has done, by an implicit expression of opposition or the enactment of a statute. And to go beyond that point, I think we need to know the specifics of the case. We need to know the constitutional power that the President—the type of Executive power the President is asserting and the situation in which it’s being asserted, and exactly what Congress has done. 

That’s the issue that’s been framed by the developments that have been in the news over the past few weeks, and as I understand the situation, it can involve statutory questions, the interpretation of FISA, and the provision of FISA that says that no wiretapping may be done except as authorized by FISA or otherwise authorized by law, and the meaning of the authorization for the use of military force, and then constitutional questions. And those would be—those are issues, as I said this morning, that may well result in litigation. They could come before me on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. They certainly could come before the Supreme Court. And before—those are weighty issues involving two of the most important considerations that can arise in constitutional law, the protection of a country and the protection of people’s fundamental rights, and I would have to know the specifics and the arguments that were made. 

The President has the obligation, under Article II of the Constitution, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. And the laws mean, first and foremost, the Constitution of the United States. That applies to everybody. It applies to the President. And the President, no less than anybody else, has to abide by the Constitution. And it also means that the President must take care that the statutes of the United States that are consistent with the Constitution are complied with, and the President has an obligation to follow those statutes as well.Those are the important general principles, and the application of them in a particular case depends on the facts of the case and the arguments, and a judge needs to know the arguments that are being made on both sides before reaching a conclusion about the result. Those are the overriding considerations.

Well, the judiciary has the responsibility to decide cases and controversies that are presented to the judiciary, and that means that there has to be a concrete dispute between parties, and the parties have to have standing under the Constitution, and there’s a whole doctrine that’s called the Political Question Doctrine, but it’s a very misleading term for people who are not lawyers. It doesn’t mean that a dispute has something to do with politics or anything like that, it means that the dispute—in the sensein which people usually use the term ‘‘politics’’—it means that it’s a kind of dispute that the Supreme Court has outlined as being not a proper dispute to be resolved by the judiciary, involving a constitutional issue that should be resolved often between the branches of Government.And I was talking earlier about some things that the President does that are not reviewable, vetoes, pardons, et cetera. There are things that Congress does that are not reviewable, impeachment, et cetera. In Baker v. Carr, Justice Brennan’s opinion outlined a whole list of factors that inform the analysis of whether something is a justiciable dispute, and sometimes these disputes between the branches of Government are held by the Supreme Court to fall into that category of being disputes that can’t properly be resolved by the courts.

I don’t think I could answer that without providing sort of an advisory opinion about something that could well come up. If this does come up in litigation, then the courts have an obligation to decide whether it’s a justiciable dispute.The Political Question Doctrine, this doctrine of issues that are not justiciable, often involves conflicts between the branches of the Government, and when a person is asserting the person’s individual rights are violated, that is the type of case that is often resolved, I mean typically resolved by the judiciary.

Well, Senator, when I was—when I referred—when I said in reference to Senator Leahy’s question that often disputes between the two branches are resolved without resorting to the courts, I don’t think I was referring specifically to this issue, and if I gave that impression, that was a false impression.I think I was—what I meant to say, and what I hope that I did say, was that separation powers disputes in general sometimes fall within this doctrine.

I have had practice sessions on a great variety of subjects, and I don’t know whether that specific issue was brought up. It may have been. But what I can tell you—

Well, exactly—no, the issue of FISA certainly has been something that I have studied, and FISA is not something that has come before me as a judge.

No, no. The specific question that you raised about the conflict between the President’s authority to say that a statute enacted by Congress should not be followed, but the general area of wiretapping and foreign intelligence surveillance wiretapping—

And the recent— 

And the recent events. 

That’s correct, but— 

Nobody at these sessions or at any of the sessions that I had has ever told me what to say in response to any question, and— 

The comments that I’ve received— 

The advice that I’ve received has gone generally to familiarizing me with the format of this hearing, which is very different from the format of legal proceedings in which I have participated either as a judge or previously when I was arguing a legal issue as a lawyer. But nobody has told me what to say. Everything that I have said is an expression of my own ideas. 

In general, yes, they’ve given me feedback, mostly about the form of the question—the form of the answers. 

Not as to the substance of the question, no, Senator. 

That’s correct, as to the format, not as to the—not as to what I should say I think about any of these questions, absolutely not. I’ve been a judge for 15 years, and I’ve made up my own mind during all that time, and—

No, I just want to make that clear. 

Nobody actually told me the bases that the President was asserting. I found the letter that was released last week or the week before by an Assistant Attorney General, setting out arguments relating to this, on the Internet myself, and printed it out, and I studied it to get some idea of some of the issues that might be involved here. And I looked at some other materials that legal scholars have put out on this issue, but nobody in the administration actually has briefed me on what the administration’s position is with respect to this issue. 

It would be very inappropriate for them to tell me what I should say, and I wouldn’t have been receptive to that sort of advice, and I did not receive that kind of advice. 

Yes, it does. Absolute immunity is quite restricted under our legal system, but there are some high-ranking officials in all three branches of the Government, who do have absolute immunity just from civil damages, not from criminal liability or from impeachment, or removal from office, but for—or for injunctive relief, they can be ordered to comply with the Constitution, but as far as civil damages are concerned. 

First of all, because it was the position that our client, whom we represented in an individual capacity, and it was his money that was at stake here, wanted to make. So we had an obli-gation that was somewhat akin to the obligation of a private attorney representing a client.Second, it was an argument to which the Department was committed. It has been made in Kissinger v. Halperin in the Carter administration. It was repeated in Harlow v. Fitzgerald in the Reagan administration. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the Supreme Court, while rejecting the idea that cabinet officers in general should have absolute immunity from civil damages, had said something like, and I’m not going to be able to provide an exact quote, but something like, but the situation could well be different for people who are involved in sensitive national security matters or foreign matters.

Senator, I actually don’t think I was expressing a personal opinion. I was saying that in my capacity as the writer of this memo who was recommending that the argument not be made, even though it was one that our client wanted to have made, I wasn’t disputing the general argument to which the Department was committed. But I thought that we should take a different approach, that we should just argue the issue of appealability. But that was not the approach that was taken.

I think the issue of the scope of the immunity that the Attorney General has is now settled by Mitchell v. Forsythe. That is the law. It was considered—the argument was considered by the Supreme Court and they decided the question.Judges have absolute immunity for their judicial decisions. Members of Congress and their staff have absolute immunity for things that they do that are integral to the legislative process. The President has absolute immunity from civil damages for the President’s official acts. But absolute immunity is used very sparingly because of just the considerations that you’re referring to. But the consideration on the other side is that people who are involved in lots of things that make other people angry—judges deciding cases, Members of Congress passing legislation, Presidents doing all sorts of things—would otherwise be subjected to the threat of so many political reprisals that they would be driven from office. It’s a policy judgment that our law has made that some people should have absolute immunity, but it’s used very sparingly.

What I was doing in that talk at Pepperdine was framing that question, and it’s a lot easier to frame the question and to ask students to think about it and give me their reactions than it is to answer it. We’ve had examples of instances in which the judiciary in the past has had to confront this issue of reviewing factual presentations of the Executive in times of national crisis and there have been instances in which the judiciary has accepted—and I’m thinking of the Japanese internment cases, has accepted, which were one of the great constitutional tragedies that our country has experienced—has accepted factual presentations by the political—by the Executive branch that turned out not to be true, and from my reading of what went on, were not believed to be true by some high-ranking Executive officials at the time.But there is the problem of judicial fact finding, which I was talking about earlier, and the context of things that may be taking place on the battlefield, for example, or things that are taking place in wartime probably are more difficult for the judiciary to evaluate than other factual questions. So that’s the dilemma and I can’t say that I can provide a clear answer to it.

Senator, I don’t have a copy of the initial computer list, so I can’t answer that question. At some point, Vanguard—the computer lists that are available from, I think, 1992 and 1993 do not have Vanguard on it and I don’t know why that is so—

I do not know. 

Senator, I don’t know. I don’t know whether I— whether they were removed. I don’t think I ever told the clerk’s office, take them off. It may be that at some point, I submitted a new list and they were not on the list. I do think it’s important to keep in mind that this list is just an aid for the judge. This is not a comprehensive list of everything that will cause a judge to recuse himself. 

That’s correct. 

That’s correct. 

Well, there was an oversight and the oversight was on my part in not focusing on the issue of recusal when I first received the case.

I am not saying something different as to the screening system. The screening system was exactly what I described this morning, and I described that to the ABA, involving—

It was not a complete computer glitch, and if I could just explain, the origin of that was that when I was down here shortly after the President announced his intention to nominate me, I started to be—I started to receive questions about this Vanguard issue and I was receiving information from our clerk’s office, and that based on the information that I received, it was my impression that there had been a computer glitch and that was the origin of that statement and that information that constitutional—

Well, Senator, when the recusal motion came in, I was disturbed by it and I wanted to see what the Code of Conduct exactly required in this context. Twelve years had gone by and no Vanguard case had come up and I hadn’t had an occasion to look at this issue. And when I looked at it, it—the recusal motion was very harsh and it accused me of unethical conduct and I took it seriously and I wanted to see what the Code required, and I researched it and it was my conclusion that I was not required by the Code to recuse, but then I went on and said, but I still don’t want to participate in this case and I would like to have the initial decision vacated and make sure that Ms. Maharaj had an entirely new appeal, and that’s what I asked for and that’s what was done.

Yes, it did, Senator. 

Yes, I did. 

That is right. 

I have tried to do that and to go beyond what— 

That is a hard question to answer and— 

That is a way of buying 30 seconds while I think about the answer. Senator, I think that what I think personally about this is really not something that would be—that would inform anything that I would have to do as a judge. 

It certainly is. 

I am reluctant to get into this because I think that things like act of war can well have particular legal meanings in particular contexts and, you know, under the Constitution. 

In a lay sense, certainly we have been in a conflict with terrorist organizations. I am just concerned that in the law all these phrases can have particular meanings that are defined by the cases. 

It certainly is, yes. 

That is certainly true. 

Senator, I agree that the Constitution was meant to deal with all of the contingencies that our country was going to face. And I think the Framers hoped that we would not get involved in many wars, but they were students of history and I am sure they realized that there would be wars. They provided for war powers for the President and for Congress, and the structure is meant to apply both in peace and in war.

That is correct. 

That is the principle of the Hamdi case. 

Well, Hamdi speaks to the situation of an individual who was caught on the battlefield. 

It is my understanding that the prisoners of war who were taken in World War II were held until the conflict was over. 

Well, I explained what my understanding is about how this matter of holding prisoners was handled in prior wars.This issue was addressed in Hamdi, in what was discussed in Hamdi in the context of—

That was the holding in Padilla. 

Yes, that was the holding of the lower court in— of Padilla, yes. 

Well, Padilla—I am sorry—Hamdi said that a person who is being detained, an unlawful person who is asserted to be an unlawful combatant and who is being detained, has the right—has due process rights. And the issue of the type of tribunal—and they explained to some degree how that would be handled, but the identity of the particular tribunal that would be required to adjudicate that was not an issue that was decided in Hamdi or any of the other cases. 

I can’t think of an example. I can’t say that I am able to survey the whole history of this issue, but I can’t think of one. 

I am not aware of such a case. 

Well, I am not aware of a precedent that addresses the issue. 

There may have been a lower court case. I am trying to remember the exact status of the individual and it was— 

Quirin case, yes. 

Well, those were a number of German saboteurs who landed by submarine in the United States and they were taken into custody and they were tried before a military tribunal and the case went up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court sustained their being tried before a military tribunal. At least one of them claimed to be an American citizen, and most of them—I think all but one or two actually were executed. 

Well, they sustained what was done under the circumstances that I described. 

It is the precedent, yes. 

Eisentrager. 

Well, they were—as I recall, they were Germans who were found in China assisting the Japanese— 

The precedent—I don’t know whether I would put it quite that broadly, Senator. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. The precedent that you—Johnson v. Eisentrager, of course, has been substantially modified, if not overruled. Ex Parte Quirin, of course, is still a precedent. There was a lower court precedent involving someone who fought with the Italian Army and I can’t remember the exact name of it, and that was the case thatI thought you were referring to when you first framed the question. But those are the precedents in the area.Then if you go back to the Civil War, there is Ex Parte Milligan and a few others. Now, in Hamdi—

Well, in this area, I think it is actually instructive to do it. But in Hamdi, the Court addressed this question of how long the detention should take place and they said—because they were responding to the argument that this situation is not like the wars of the past which had a more or less fixed—it was not anticipated that they would go on for a generation and they said we will get to that if it develops that way. 

On intelligence matters, I would think that is an area where the judiciary doesn’t have expertise. But we do get into this issue I was discussing with Senator Feingold about the degree to which—the balance between the judiciary’s performing its function in cases involving individual rights and its desire not to intrude into areas where it lacks expertise particularly in times of war and national crisis. 

The courts do not have expertise in foreign affairs or in military affairs, and they certainly should recognize that. And that is one powerful consideration in addressing legal issues that may come up in this context. But there is the other powerful consideration that it is the responsibility of the courts to protect individual rights in cases that are properly before the Court, cases where they have jurisdiction in one way or another, cases that are fit for judicial resolution. 

I have some familiarity with it. 

I think it has, but it’s not really my area of authority. That’s Congress’s area of authority.

I think the Geneva Convention—and I’m not an expert on the Geneva Conventions, but I think they express some very deep values of the American people, and we have been a signatory of them for some time, and I think that—

Well, that’s an issue, I believe, in the Hamdan case, which is an actual case that’s before the Supreme Court. It goes to the question of whether a treaty is self-executing or not. Some treaties are self-executing.

I’m not familiar with such a case, but I can’t say whether there might be some case or not.

That’s what was involved in Hamdi. 

The President has to follow the law, and that means the Constitution and the laws that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. 

The Convention Against Torture, well, the statutes implementing the Convention Against Torture. 

That’s right. If death results, the death penalty is available. 

Yes, they were.

The President has to comply with the Constitution and the laws of the United States that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. That is the principle. The President is not above the Constitution and the laws.Now, there are issues about the interpretation of the laws and the interpretation of the Constitution, but—

I think it depends on what you mean by that phrase, and if you— 

I have heard the term used. 

Well, if a strict constructionist is a judge who doesn’t make things up, then I’m a strict constructionist. 

I agree with that, Senator. 

I think that a strict constructionist, as you understand it, would engage in a certain process in evaluating that question, and a strict constructionist, a person who interprets the law— and that’s how I would put it. A person who interprets the law would look at the language of the authorization for the use of military force and legislative history that was informative, maybe past practices—were there prior enactments that are analogous to that? What was the understanding of those? And a host of other considerations that might go into the interpretive process. 

I have a certain self-interest in the answer to that question. 

I think that— 

It is a majority. 

Speaking in my personal capacity or in my judicial capacity? [Laughter.] 

Senator, I just don’t think I should answer questions like—constitutional questions like that. I need to know— 

Well, when—there are certain questions that seem perfectly clear, and I guess there is no harm in answering— 

You know what? I remember this phrase from law school—

I think it’s what we call in law school ‘‘the slippery slope,’’ and if you start answering the easy questions, you’re going to be sliding down the ski run and into the hard questions, and that’s what— 

Well, I think it has been traditionally recognized that lawyers have an obligation to their clients. That’s how our legal system works. Some lawyers have private clients. Some lawyers work for Government agencies, and the lawyer-client relationship there is not exactly the same. But, still, there is a lawyer-client relationship. And I think our whole system is based on the idea that justice is best served— 

I think that Attorneys General—I can speak to the issue of the Attorney General of the United States because I know there’s a statute and there’s an understanding about what the Attorney General of the United States will do when an Act of Congress is called into question, and the obligation of the Attorney General is to defend the constitutionality of the Act of Congress unless no reasonable— 

It certainly is, yes. 

Consistent with ethical obligations and professional responsibility, yes, indeed. 

Well, it’s been a combination of—at times it’s been a thrill and at times it’s been extremely disorienting. I spent the last 15 years as a judge on the court of appeals, and you probably could not think of a more cloistered existence than a judge on the court of appeals. Most of the time nobody other than the parties pays attention to what we do. When an article is written in the paper about one of our decisions, it’s ‘‘a Federal appeals court inPhiladelphia’’ or in whatever city. And this has been a strange process for me. I made some reference to that yesterday, but I understand the reason for it. And I am reluctant in my current capacity as a nominee to offer any suggestions about the process. I think that’s—you’re carrying out your responsibility. I spoke about the fact that different people under the Constitution have different obligations, and you have the advice and consent function, Congress, the Senate does. And I think it’s for the Senate to decide what it should do in this area.

Senator, it was an accurate statement of my views at the time. That was in 1985, and I made it from my vantage point as an attorney in the Solicitor General’s Office, but it was an expression of what I thought at that time. If the issue were to come before me as a judge, if I am confirmed and if this issue were to come up, the first question that would have to be addressed is the question of stare decisis, which I have discussed earlier, and it’s a very important doctrine and that was the starting point and the ending point of the joint opinion in Casey. And then if I were to get beyond that, if a court were to get beyond the issue of stare decisis, then I would have to go through the whole judicial decisionmaking process before reaching a conclusion. 

Senator— 

The answer to the question is that I would address that issue in accordance with the judicial process as I understand it and as I have practiced it. That is the only way I can answer that question.

And Senator, I would make up my mind on that question if I got to it, if I got past the issue of stare decisis, after going through the whole process that I have described. I would need to know the case that was before me and I would have to consider the arguments, and they might be different arguments from the arguments that were available in 1985—

The question about the supremacy—the statement about the supremacy of the elected branches of government went to my understanding of the constitutional structure of our country, and so certainly that’s a subject that it is proper for me to talk about. But the only way—you are asking me how I would decide an issue—

You are asking me my view of a question that— 

The Constitution contains the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment. It provides protection for liberty. It provides substantive protection. And the Supreme Court has told us what the standard is for determining whether something falls within the scope of the protection—

Certainly, it does. That is in the First Amendment. 

Because answering the question of whether the Constitution provides a right to free speech is simply responding to whether there is language in the First Amendment that says that the freedom of speech and freedom of the press can’t be abridged. Asking about the issue of abortion has to do with the interpretation of certain provisions of the Constitution. 

Senator, I think— 

I have not changed my opinion of my mother-inlaw. That’s a question— 

It is a strong principle— 

Yes. 

I agree with the statement. 

Well, Senator, I have explained my understanding of the doctrine of stare decisis and it is important to me. I think it is an important part of our legal system. It is— 

Well, I don’t think I should comment on all of those cases. 

No, I don’t. 

Well, I certainly was not aware of what he had said about stare decisis when I made those comments. I have explained those comments. They were made when I was an appointee of President Reagan, and Judge Bork was President Reagan’s—

No, but I had been in the Department of Justice at the time of—

And I was asked a question about Judge Bork, and I had been in the Department at the time of his nomination, and I was an appointee of President Reagan, and I was a supporter of the nomination.

Yes, and I’ve tried to follow Third Circuit precedents while I’ve been—

You did, Senator, and I think that you need to examine each of the cases to see whether what I did was justified. Let me just take one that struck me when you read from it, and that was the United Artists case. What I said there was that a Supreme Court decision that had come up, that had been handed down after the most recent Third Circuit decision relating to the issue, superseded what our court had said. So I was following an aspect of stare decisis there. I was following what we call horizontal—I’m sorry—vertical stare decisis following the Supreme Court, and I don’t think there’s any dispute that when the Supreme Court hands down a decision that’s in conflict with one of our earlier cases, we have to follow the Supreme Court.

And, Senator, there was this body of Third Circuit precedent, and then—and it said that it’s proper for a Federal court to get involved in a zoning dispute, which is traditionally a local matter, if there is simply an improper motive, whatever that might be. And in the—after that the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Souter, emphasized that the test under substantive due process in an area like this, an area that the other judge in the ma-jority and I thought was like this, is whether what was done shocks the conscience.And so you have a Supreme Court decision intervening, and in that situation I thought it was our obligation—and I wrote the majority opinion there—to follow what the Supreme Court had said.

Well, Senator, could I just respond to that— 

If the matter were to come up before me on the Supreme Court, I would consider the issue of stare decisis, and if the case got beyond that, I would go through that entire judicial decisionmaking process that I described. That’s not a formality to me. That is the way in which I think a judge or a Justice has to address legal issues, and I think that is very important, and I don’t know a way to answer a question about how I would decide a constitutional question that might come up in the future, other than to say I would go through that whole process. I don’t agree with the idea that the Constitution always trumps stare decisis— 

I don’t agree with the theory that the Constitution always trumps stare decisis. There would be no need for the—there would be no room for the doctrine of stare decisis in constitutional law if that were the case. 

It certainly can, and I think that is a good thing because otherwise, Plessy v. Ferguson would still be on the books. 

I am familiar with that question. 

No. The word that appears in the Constitution is ‘‘liberty.’’

There is no express reference to privacy in the Constitution, but it is protected by the Fourth Amendment and in certain circumstances by the First Amendment and in certain circumstances by the Fifth and the 14th Amendments.

That is correct. It is a question of interpretation rather than simply looking at what is in the text of the document.

Yes, that is my view of it. 

Yes. Griswold talked about emanations and penumbras, and Griswold has later been understood by the Supreme Court as being based on the protection of liberty under the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment. 

That is correct. 

Well, he was the former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit and he was a Federal judge for many years and greatly respected. 

I think probably most people would describe him that way. I thought we got along very well, and we generallyagreed. There were cases in which we disagreed and cases in which I dissented from an opinion that he wrote. And I think there were cases in which he dissented from opinions that I wrote.

No, I wasn’t. I was not. 

Yes, that is the structure of the Constitution. The Federal Government has certain—has enumerated powers. Some of them are broad, but those are the powers the Federal Government has and the theory—and the structure is that everything else was reserved for the States.

Well, that is what Lopez, as I understand it, tried to do. It said that although the commerce power is broad, it is not all-encompassing. It involves the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, and this statute that we have in Lopez goes beyond that. And my case, the Rybar case, seems to me to be as close to the situation in Lopez as any case that I was aware of.

Yes, she did. 

I agree with that she said that Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause is not all-encompassing. And my jobas a court of appeals judge is not to say that a decision of the Supreme Court should be limited to its facts; in other words, not applied as a precedent in any other comparable situation that comes along. My job is to take those precedents seriously and that is what I tried to do.

That’s correct. In Lopez, the Supreme Court said that possession of a firearm, mere possession is not a commercial activity, and the interstate commerce—the Commerce Clause authorizes the regulation of interstate commerce, and the activity involved in Rybar was the possession of a firearm. So it followed that if it was a noncommercial activity in Lopez, it must be a noncommercial activity in Rybar. That’s how I saw it.

No. The State could, and I think a great majority of States, if not—the great majority certainly have legislation of that nature.

Yes, that was a strong point that I made in the dissent, that if Congress had made findings, it would have been a very different case for me.

Well, that’s correct. He was a criminal defendant. 

No, I did not. I thought the government had not come forward with evidence to support the position that they were arguing. 

I would. Taxman was a case that our court considered en banc, that is, all the judges were sitting, and I sit on a very moderate court that is certainly not unreceptive to the concept of affirmative action in general. But the vote in that case was 8–4. It wasn’t a close vote. And I joined the opinion that was writtenby my late colleague, Judge Mansmann, holding that that particular affirmative action plan was in violation of Title VII.

Yes, Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Akron, which was the last previous big Supreme Court decision at that time, was one of the things that influenced me in the memo that I wrote in Thornburgh. She analyzed Roe, and I was quite persuaded by the points that she made in the Akron decision. And the general approach—the arguments that I was recommending that the Government make in the Thornburgh case were along the lines of the undue burden standard I think that was later—that she later adopted. I was arguing that the particular provisions should be challenged on their own terms. One of the provisions was an informed consent provision that was virtually identical to the informed consent provision that later came up in Casey, and in Casey it was upheld.

Yes. 

It certainly had been at the time of the 1985 memo, and although I wasn’t recommending that the Government get into that issue, I mentioned in the memo some of the authors who had criticized Roe’s reasoning. 

In Casey, the Supreme Court moved away from the trimester approach, and they adopted the undue burden standard, which had been set out in some earlier opinions by Justice O’Connor and the joint opinion in Casey made it clear that that was now the governing standard under Supreme Court law.

Yes, that’s what they held. 

Yes, that’s exactly correct. Eighteen U.S.C. 4001, which is called the anti-detention statute, says that nobody may be detained without authorization, and in Hamdi, Justice O’Connor’s opinion concluded that the authorization for the use of militaryforce constituted statutory authorization to detain a person who had been taken prisoner as an unlawful combatant in Afghanistan.

Yes, that’s correct. This is a case where Justice O’Connor’s view of the scope of Executive power was broader, considerably broader, than Justice Scalia’s. Justice Scalia’s position was that unless habeas corpus is suspended, and there are only limited circumstances in which that can take place, then there would have to be a criminal trial.

I think that is correct, Senator. I think that all these labels when you are trying to describe how judges behave, how they do their work, have their limitations and different people use them in different ways.

I wasn’t asked whether she had stopped beating me. [Laughter.] 

Certainly, Senator. 

Absolutely, Senator. That was one of the greatest, if not the single greatest thing that the Supreme Court of the United States has ever done. 

Yes, they did, and that was, I think—of course, we fought a Civil War to get the 14th Amendment and to adopt the constitutional principle of equality for people of all races. 

Brown v. Board of Education, as you pointed out, is based on the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, and the 14th Amendment, of course, was adopted and ratified after the Civil War. It talks about equality. It talks about equal protection of the law, and the principle that was finally recognized in Brown v. Board of Education, after nearly a century of misapplication of the 14th Amendment, is that denying people the opportunity, people of a particular race the opportunity to attend schools, or for that matter, to make use of other public facilities that are open to people of a different race, denies them equality. They’re not treated the same way. An African-American is not treated the same way as a white person when they’re treated that way, so they’re denied equality, and that is based squarely on the language of the Equal Protection Clause and on the principle, the principle that was—the magnificent principle that emerged from this great struggle that is embodied in the Equal Protection Clause.Griswold concerned the marital right to privacy, and when the decision was handed down, it was written by Justice Douglas, and he based that on his theories of—his theory of emanations and pe-numbras from various constitutional provisions, the Ninth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment, and a variety of others, but it has been understood in later cases as based on the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, which says that no person shall be denied due process—shall be denied liberty without due process of law. And that’s my understanding of it.And the issue that was involved in Griswold, the possession of contraceptives by married people, is not an issue that is likely to come before the courts again. It’s not likely to come before the Third Circuit, it’s not likely to come before the Supreme Court, so I feel an ability to comment, a greater ability to comment on that than I do on an issue that is involved in litigation.And what I have said about Roe is that if the issue were to come before me if I am confirmed, and I’m on the Supreme Court, and the issue comes up, the first step in the analysis for me would be the issue of stare decisis, and that would be very important. The things that I said in the 1985 memo were a true expression of my views at the time from my vantage point as an attorney in the Solicitor General’s Office, but that was 20 years ago, and a great deal has happened in the case law since then. Thornburgh was decided, and then Webster and then Casey and a number of other decisions. So the stare decisis analysis would have to take account of that entire line of case law.And then if I got beyond that, I would approach the question— and of course in Casey, that was the beginning and the ending point of the analysis in the joint opinion. If I were to get beyond that, I would approach that question the way I approach every legal issue that I approach as a judge, and that is to approach it with an open mind, and to go through the whole judicial process which is designed—and I believe strongly in it—to achieve good results, to achieve good decisionmaking.

Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. It was decided in 1973, so it has been on the books for a long time. It has been challenged on a number of occasions, and I discussed those yesterday, and the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the decision, sometimes on the merits, sometimes in Caseybased on stare decisis, and I think that when a decision is challenged and it is reaffirmed that strengthens its value as stare decisis for at least two reasons. First of all, the more often a decision is reaffirmed, the more people tend to rely on it, and second, I think stare decisis reflects the view that there is wisdom embedded in decisions that have been made by prior Justices who take the same oath and are scholars and are conscientious, and when they examine a question and they reach a conclusion, I think that’s entitled to considerable respect, and of course, the more times that happens, the more respect the decision is entitled to, and that’s my view of that. So it is a very important precedent that—

It is a—if settled means that it can’t be re-examined, then that’s one thing. If settled means that it is a precedent that is entitled to respect as stare decisis, and all of the factors that I’ve mentioned come into play, including the reaffirmation and all of that, then it is a precedent that is protected, entitled to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis in that way. 

I have explained, Senator, as best I can how I see it. It is a precedent that has now been on the books for several decades. It has been challenged. It has been reaffirmed, but it is an issue that is involved in litigation now at all levels. There is an abortion case before the Supreme Court this term. There are abortion cases in the lower courts. I’ve sat on three of them on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I’m sure there are others in other courts of appeals, or working their way toward the courts of appeals right now, so it’s an issue that is involved in a considerable amount of litigation that is going on. 

Well, Diane Weeks was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey, and somebody that I hired, and one of many women whom I hired when I was U.S. Attorney, and I think that illustrates my attitude toward equality for women.I’ve said what I can say about what I can recall about this group, Senator, which is virtually nothing. I put it down on the ‘85 form as a group in which I was a member. I didn’t say I was anything more than a member. And since I put it down, I’m sure that I was a member at the time, but I’m also sure—and I have racked my memory on this—that if I had participated in the group in any active way, if I had attended meetings or done anything else substantial in connection with this group, I would remember it, and if I had renewed my membership, for example, over a period of years, I’m sure I would remember that. So that’s the best I can reconstruct as to what happened with this group.I mentioned, in wracking my memory about this, I said, what would it have been, what could it have been about the administration of Princeton that would have caused me to sign up to be a member of this group around the time of this application? And I don’t have a specific recollection, but I do know that the issue of ROTC has bothered me for a long period of time. The expulsion ofthe units at the time when I was a student there, struck me as a very bad thing for Princeton to do.

No, and I did not join this group, I’m quite confident, because of any attitude toward women or minorities. What has bothered me about—what bothered me about the Princeton administration over a period of time was the treatment of ROTC, and after the unit was brought back, I know there’s been a continuing controversy over a period of years about whether it would be kept on campus, whether in any way this was demeaning to the university to have an ROTC unit on campus, whether students who were enrolled in ROTC could receive credit for the courses, whether the members of—whether the ROTC instructors could be considered in any way a part of the faculty. All of this bothered me, and it is my recollection that it continued over a period of time.

I am to some degree, yes. 

There was the movement sometime ago—we don’t have an official State song, and there was a movement to make ‘‘Born to Run’’ our official State song, but it didn’t quite make it. 

Well, the analogy went to the issue of statistics and the use and misuse of statistics and the fact that statistics can be quite misleading. Statistics are very powerful, but statistics can also be very misleading, and that’s what that was referring to. There’s a whole—I mean, statistics is a branch of mathematics, and there are ways to analyze statistics so that you draw sound conclusions from them and avoid erroneous conclusions from them. Sometimes when you see a pattern, it’s the result of a cause, and sometimes when you see something that looks like it might be a pattern, it’s the result of chance.Riley was a very, very difficult case, and I can tell you I struggled over that case because the issue of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system is an issue of enormous importance. Obviously, it’s very important for the defendant. It’s important for the society so that everybody knows that everyone in this country is treated equally regardless of race. And it’s important for law enforcement, because I know from years as a prosecutor that nothing is a greater poison for law enforcement than even the slightest hint of unfairness.The issue of racial discrimination in the jury had to be viewed by our court and by me under the habeas corpus statute that Congress passed, and that gave us an important role to play, but a very limited role. The Pennsylvania—and what the habeas corpus statute is that if the State courts have decided a question on the merits and they’ve applied the correct legal standard, the correct constitutional standard, we can’t authorize a granting of a writ of habeas corpus unless they were unreasonable. It’s not enough for us to say, ‘‘We don’t agree with it.’’ We have to say, ‘‘You were unreasonable.’’Now, I think seven members of the Pennsylvania judiciary—well, I think there were more. There was the judge who heard the State habeas case and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, as I recall, was unanimous on the issue that there hadn’t been racial discrimination in the selection of the jury in the case.Then the case came up to us, and the issue was whether the State courts were unreasonable in finding that the particular peremptory challenges at issue in this case were not based on race. And it was a tough question, but I didn’t see how we could overturn what they had done under the habeas standard. Now—

Well, Senator, the district court thought that the defendant in that case was entitled to summary—was entitled to summary judgment, and so I think that says something about the facts of the case and whether it was a particularly strong case.There’s a very important principle involved in the appellate practice, and I think it goes with the idea of judicial self-restraint. It is that certain things are to be decided at certain levels in the court system, and that requires that parties raise issues in the trial court; and that if they do not raise the issue in the trial court, then absent some extraordinary circumstances, they shouldn’t be able to raise the issue on appeal. And that was the principle there.Now, this was not a criminal case. In a criminal case, there’s a constitutional right to counsel, and so a person can claim ineffective assistance of counsel. And we treat that issue differently in criminal cases than we do in civil cases.

The facility that was involved in that case was not a mine as a lay person would think of a mine. It wasn’t an underground facility. It wasn’t like the facility in West Virginia where the terrible accident occurred a few days ago. It was basically a pile of coal that was being loaded onto trucks to be transported to another place. The definition of a mine under the Federal law is very broad, and it’s not limited to what ordinary people would think of as a mine. And there was an argument that this facility, which, as I said, as I recall, was basically a big pile of coal on top of the ground and coal was being hauled away to a cogeneration facility. Is that a mine? An ordinary person would look at that and say that’s not a mine, that’s a pile of coal.But the issue in the case was the kind of technical issue of interpretation that we get all the time, and the question was is this a mine in the sense of the law, and I thought it was not a mine in the sense of the law.Now, that conclusion, I don’t believe, would mean that this facility would be spared safety regulation at either the Federal or local level. It’s been a long time since I worked on that case, but I would imagine that if the facility is not governed by the Federal mining laws, it would be covered by OSHA, by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and perhaps by State law. So the issue would not be whether this facility would be allowed, which was not a mine in the ordinary sense, would be allowed to operate in an unsafe fashion. It was which body of laws and regulations would govern the facility.

Yes, could I just say a couple of words? That case was a case of statutory interpretation and applying the statute, and that’s how I thought it came out. There have been many other cases that I have worked on on the court of appeals where I have come out in favor of the small person who was challenging a big institution, and I could mention a number of them.Let me just mention Shore v. Regional High School because I think it has some relation to the Pirolli case, which you mentioned. This was a case in which a high school student had been bullied unmercifully by other students in his school because of their perception of his sexual orientation. He had been bullied to the point of attempting to commit suicide, and his parents wanted to enroll him at an adjacent public high school, and the school board said, no, you can’t do that. And I wrote an opinion upholding their right to have him placed in a safe school in an adjacent municipality.That is just one example, but all of these cases involve what judges are supposed to do, which is to take the law and apply it to the particular facts of the case that is before them.

I do. He was a fine— 

Well, when the Court gets something wrong and there’s a prior precedent, then you have to analyze the doctrine of stare decisis. It is an important doctrine, and I have said a lot about it, but— 

Plessy was certainly wrong. 

It certainly would be a factor that you would consider in determining whether to overrule it. 

A doctrine that you would consider. 

Certainly. 

The Court certainly got it wrong in Plessy, and it got it spectacularly wrong in Plessy, and it took a long time for that erroneous decision to be overruled. One of things I think that people should have understood is that separate facilities, even if they were absolutely equal in every re-spect, even if they were identical, could never give people equal treatment under the law.

I think they should have recognized that. But one of the things that was illustrated in those cases—and Sweatt v. Painter, the last one on the list brought that out—was that, in fact, the facilities, the supposedly equal facilities were never equal, and the continuing series of litigation that was brought by the NAACP to challenge racial discrimination illustrated—if the illustration was needed, the litigation illustrated that, in fact, the facilities that were supposedly equal were not equal. And that was an important factor, I think, in leading to the decision in Brown v. Board of Education 

It certainly was repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause. 

I think they are repugnant to the traditions of our country. I don’t think there is any question about that. 

First of all, Senator, I think the Constitution means something, and I don’t think it means whatever I might want it to mean or whatever any other member of the judiciary might want it to mean. It has its own meaning, and it is the job of a judge, the job of a Supreme Court Justice, to interpret the Constitution, not distort the Constitution, not add to the Constitution or subtract from the Constitution.In interpreting the Constitution, I think we should proceed in the way we proceed in interpreting other important legal authorities. In interpreting statutes, for example, I think we should look to the text of the Constitution and we should look to the meaning that someone would have taken from the text of the Constitution at the time of its adoption. But I think we have to recognize that the Constitution is very different from statutes in some important respects. Statutes are often very detailed, and they generally don’t exist without revision for very long periods of time. The Constitution was adopted to endure throughout the history of our country, and considering how long our country has existed, it’s been amended relatively few times. And the magic of that, I think, is that it sets out a basic structure for our Government and protects fundamental rights. But on a number of very important issues, I think the Framers recognized that times would change, new questions would come up, and so they didn’t purport to adopt a detailed code, for example, governing searches and seizures. That was the example I gave yesterday, and I will come back to it. They could have set out a detailed code of search and seizure. They didn’t do that. They said that the people are protected against unreasonable searches and seizures, and they left it for the courts—and, of course, the legislative body can supplement this—to apply that principle to the new situations that come up.Now, when that is done, that doesn’t amount to an amendment of the Constitution or a changing of the Constitution. It amounts to—it involves the application of a constitutional principle to the situation at hand.

Yes, it is, Senator. 

Well, this is an area in which the Supreme Court has handed down several decisions, and like a lot of the—like a number of the issues that the Court has addressed under the Establishment Clause, it has drawn some fairly fine lines. The first case involving a display of this nature was the Pawtucket, Rhode Island, display that was involved in Lynch v. Donnelly, and it was a display that was similar to the display in Jersey City. It included both religious and secular symbols. And they found that that was not a violation. 

Well, that was exactly what Jersey City had decided in that case, and Jersey City said: We are one of the most religiously diverse, ethnically diverse, racially diverse communities you will find anywhere in the country. This is right across the New York harbor from the Statue of Liberty and from Ellis Island, and it is still an entry point for a lot of people coming into the country.And so they had—over the course of the year, at the appropriate time, they had a Christmas display, they had a display of a menorah—on that particular year, Hanukkah was early in the month of December, so the display, the menorah was up at a different point. They had a display—they had celebrations for Muslim festivals, for Hindu festivals, for Buddhist festivals, for Latino festivals, for festivals concerning the many ethnic groups in the community. And their view was that this is the way we should show that all of these groups are valuable parts of our community and express our embracing of them. And this display, they said, reflected that philosophy and applying the precedents that the Supreme Court had provided in this area, the Pawtucket case and a later case involving a display in Pittsburgh, Judge Rendell and I, who were the judges in the majority on that case, said this is constitutional, this is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

Yes, Senator, I do. Justice O’Connor pointed out something that’s very critical in this area. She said there is a big difference between Government speech endorsing religion and private religious speech, and this case—and private religious speech can’t be discriminated against. It has to be treated equally with secular speech. And in this case, this involved a student who—and there were two incidents. One involved reading. The students in the class were told that if they could read at a certain level, they would have—their reward would be to be able to read their favorite story to the class. And this student satisfied those requirements, and the student wanted to read a very simplified version of the story of Jacob and Esau to the class. And the teacher said, ‘‘No, you can’t read that to the class. You can read that privately to me off in a corner.’’And then Thanksgiving was coming along, and the students were told, ‘‘Draw a picture of something that you’re thankful for,’’ and I guess the teacher expected they were going to draw pictures of football games and turkeys and things like that. But this student drew a picture of Jesus and said, ‘‘That’s what I’m thankful for.’’ And the teacher put all the other pictures up in the hall, but would not put this student’s picture up in the hall because of its religious content.And that, we found, was a violation of this principle that you have to treat religious speech equally with secular speech. If you ask a student to say something about a topic, what are you thank-ful for, and the student says something that fits within the topic that the student was asked to talk about, then you can’t discriminate against one kind of speech or another.

Well, the Exceptions Clause obviously gives Congress the authority to define the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and it can provide for various avenues by which cases get to the Supreme Court, and that has changed over the years.There’s been a controversy, never resolved, about the exact scope of the authority. It came up in Ex Parte McCardle in the post-Civil War era, and it has been raised by—it has been discussed by scholars in subsequent years, and there are several schools of thought in the question about whether it would be consistent with the Constitution for Congress to eliminate jurisdiction in the Supreme Court over a particular type of case, that’s an unresolved issue that the scholars have addressed, and some argue that that falls within the Exceptions Clause, and some argue that it would be inconsistent with other provisions of the Constitution.

Well, several constitutional doctrines seem to be implicated by the matters that you discussed. The Full Faith and Credit Clause in general means that one State must honor judgments that are issued by a court of another State, and it’s an important part of the process. It is an important part of the Federal system, so that we don’t have worrying decisions in different States. It is not my—I have not had cases involving this, but there are—the doctrine has a certain, has certain boundaries to it. There are exceptions, and it covers certain areas and doesn’t cover other areas, and a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act under the Full Faith and Credit Clause would call into question the precise scope of the doctrine.And I believe that scholars have expressed differing views about how it would apply in that situation, and that’s an issue that may well come up within the Federal courts, almost certain to do so.

It is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution. 

That’s its origin, yes. 

I don’t know the exact figure, Senator. 

No, they didn’t. They conferred the judicial power on the judiciary, and I think that contemplated that the Federal judiciary would be permitted to proceed with—in accordance with fundamental judicial procedures as they had been known— 

At the time. 

Well, I don’t think that we should look to foreign law to interpret our own Constitution. I agree with you that the laws of the United States consist of the Constitution and treaties and laws, and I would add regulations that are promulgated in accordance with law. And I don’t think that it’s appropriate or useful to look to foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution. I think the Framers would be stunned by the idea that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by taking a poll of the countries of the world. The purpose of the Bill of Rights was to give Americans rights that were recognized practically nowhere else in the world at the time. The Framers did not want Americans to have the rights of people in France or the rights of people in Russia, or any of the other countries on the continent of Europe at the time. They wanted them to have the rights of Americans, and I think we should interpret our Constitution—we should interpret our Constitution. I don’t think it’s appropriate to look to foreign law.I also don’t think that it’s—I think that it presents a host of practical problems that have been pointed out. You have to decide which countries you are going to survey, and then it is often difficult to understand exactly what you are to make of foreign court decisions. All countries don’t set up their court systems the same way. Foreign courts may have greater authority than the courts of the United States. They may be given a policymaking role, and therefore, it would be more appropriate for them to weigh in on policy issues. When our Constitution was being debated, there was a serious proposal to have members of the judiciary sit on a council of revision, where they would have a policymaking role before legislation was passed, and other countries can set up their judiciary in that way. So you’d have to understand the jurisdiction and the authority of the foreign courts.And then sometimes it’s misleading to look to just one narrow provision of foreign law without considering the larger body of law in which it’s located. That can be—if you focus too narrowly on that, you may distort the big picture, so for those reasons, I just don’t think that’s a useful thing to do.

The Supreme Court simply gives the President the authority to nominate Justices of the Supreme Court and other Federal judges, and gives Congress the advice and consent responsibility, and doesn’t go further than that.

That’s correct. 

I think that every Supreme Court Justice is an individual, and I think every nominee is an individual, and no nominee can ever be a duplicate of someone who retires, and particularly when someone retires after such a distinguished career and such a historic career as Justice O’Connor. Nobody can be expected as a nominee to fit that mold. 

The only—if I’m confirmed, I’ll be myself. I’ll be the same person that I was on the Court of Appeals. That’s the only thing that I can say in answer to that. 

She was—the vote was 90 something to a small number. I know that, yes.

I think it’s a chance to make a contribution. I think it’s a chance to use whatever talent I have in the most productive way that I can think of. There are a lot of things that I can’t do and a lot of things that I couldn’t do very well if I was given the assignment of doing them, but I’ve spent most of my career as an appellate attorney. Well, I spent most of my career before becoming a judge as an appellate attorney and now I’ve spent 15 years as an appellate judge and I think this is what I do best. I think this gives me an opportunity to make a contribution to the country and to the society, because the Supreme Court has a very important role to play and it’s important that it do the things that it’s supposed to do well and I would do my very best to further that.And it is also important for the Supreme Court, and for that matter, all of the Federal courts, to exercise restraint. As you were referring to earlier, that has turned out to be the principal check on the way the judiciary does its work on a day-to-day basis. The judiciary is not checked in its day-to-day work in the same way as the Congress and the President. The Congress can pass a law or pass a bill and the President can veto it. One House can pass a bill, the other House may not go along. The President has to propose legislation to Congress if the President wants legislation. Congress can pass laws that the President doesn’t like. There are checks and balances that are worked out in the ordinary processes of government.But when it comes to the judiciary in deciding constitutional cases, the judiciary is checked on a daily basis primarily by its own discipline, its own self-restraint. And so it’s important for—the judiciary has these twin responsibilities that are in intention at times, doing what it is supposed to do and doing those things well and vigorously and courageously, if it comes to that, but at the same time, constantly monitoring its own activities and asking, are we doing what we are supposed to be doing as judges? Are we functioning as judges, or are we stepping over the line? Are we turning ourselves into legislators? Are we turning ourselves into members of the executive branch or administrators? And the judiciary has to maintain its independence. That’s of critical importance, and that’s an important part of the role and that also has to be informed by this sense of self-restraint.

Senator, I tried to—in my opening statement, I tried to provide a little picture of who I am as a human being and how my background and my experiences have shaped me and brought me to this point. I don’t come from an affluent background or a privileged background. My parents were both quite poor when they were growing up. I know about their experiences, and I didn’t experience those things. I don’t take credit for anything that they did or anything that they overcame, but I think that children learn a lot from their parents and they learn from what the parents say, but I think they learn a lot more from what the parents do and from what they take from the stories of their parents’ lives.And that’s why I went into that in my opening statement, because when a case comes before me involving, let’s say, someone who is an immigrant, and we get an awful lot of immigration cases and naturalization cases, I can’t help but think of my own ancestors because it wasn’t that long ago when they were in that position. And so it’s my job to apply the law. It’s not my job to change the law or to bend the law to achieve any results, but I have to, when I look at those cases, I have to say to myself, and I do say to myself, this could be your grandfather. This could be your grandmother. They were not citizens at one time and they were people who came to this country.When I have cases involving children, I can’t help but think of my own children and think about my children being treated in the way the children may be treated in the case that’s before me. And that goes down the line. When I get a case about discrimination, I have to think about people in my own family who suffered discrimination because of their ethnic background or because of religion or because of gender, and I do take that into account. When I have a case involving someone who’s been subjected to discrimination because of disability, I have to think of people who I’ve known and admired very greatly who had disabilities and I’ve watched them struggle to overcome the barriers that society puts up, often just because it doesn’t think of what it’s doing, the barriers that it puts up to them.So those are some of the experiences that have shaped me as a person.

I think the branches of government are equal and everybody, all the officers in all the branches of government take an oath to the same Constitution—

I would never suggest that judges have superior reasoning power than does Congress. I think what the Court was getting at when it made that statement in Morrison, and yesterday, I looked at something that I had written and said that was not well phrased, I think that what the Court was getting at there in Morrison was that it was applying a certain standard, a certain legal standard as to whether something substantially affected commerce, and I think that is what they were getting at, but— 

I think that Congress’s ability to reason is fully equal to that of the judiciary and I think Congress—

I have always thought that and nothing has changed my mind about that. 

Well, like many tests in the law, it is not a mathematical or a scientific formula that can produce a particular result with certainty as it is applied to particular situations. It addresses— 

It addresses a difficult problem the Court has grappled with over the years and that is the scope of Congress’s authority under Section V of the 15th Amendment—of the 14th Amendment to pass legislation enforcing the provisions of the 14th Amendment, and one argument that has been made which would represent a very narrow interpretation of congressional power, and this is basically the argument that Justice Scalia—the position that Justice Scalia took in the dissent that you mentioned, is that Congress’ authority doesn’t extend any further than remedying actual violations of the 14th Amendment, that there is no—Congress doesn’t have additional authority to enact prophylactic measures outside of the area of race, which Justice Scalia would treat dif-ferently and recognize broader authority because of the historical origin of the 14th Amendment.

There are a number of tests that have been used and proposed over the years in this area and this is the subject, I think, of continuing litigation in the Supreme Court. There is the Maryland v. Wirtz approach and then the City of Boerne approach, and you mentioned that the City of Boerne is a relatively recent decision and it’s been followed by a number of subsequent decisions—

Well, I think it was an effort by the majority in that case to identify a standard that would not strictly limit congressional power to remedying established violations of the 14th Amendment without going—while still, in their view, retaining the necessary remedial connection to Section V of the 14th Amendment. It is an approach that they have used in a number of cases and the cases have not come out—sometimes the results in the cases have not been predictable.You mentioned the contrast between the two decisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I think Nevada v. Hibbs was a decision that some people—that surprised some people based on the Court’s prior precedents. So there is, I think, still some ferment in this area and I am sure it is a question that’s going to be—that will come up in future cases.

In the area of habeas corpus, there are a number of important principles that have to be considered in reviewing any legislation that is argued to—that someone contends has altered habeas jurisdiction. The first is that the Court said in a case called INS v. Cyr that if there is an attempt to—that habeas jurisdiction can’t be taken away unless it’s clear in the statute that that’s what was intended. Habeas jurisdiction is not to be repealed by implication. That’s one important principle.And then in Felker v. Turpin, which involved the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Congress—I’m sorry, the Supreme Court considered arguments about whether provisions of that legislation which restructured Federal habeas review violated the Constitution and they found that there wasn’t a violation because the essentials of the writ were preserved. And so if other legislation is challenged, it would have to be reviewed under standards like that.

Well, I had the opportunity to deal with this issue actually in relation to my own court a number of years ago. All the courts of appeals were given the authority to allow their oral arguments to be televised if they wanted and we had a debate within our court about whether we would, or whether we should allow television cameras in our courtroom and I argued that we should do it. I thought that it would be a useful— 

Well, I did, and this is one of the matters on which I ended up in dissent in my court. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I think the majority was fearful that our Nielsen numbers would be in the negatives. 

The issue is a little bit different on the Supreme Court and it would be presumptuous for me to talk about it right now, particularly since I think at least one of the Justices has said that a television camera would make its way into the SupremeCourt courtroom over his dead body, so I wouldn’t want to comment on it.

I will keep an open mind despite the position I took on the Third Circuit.[Laughter.] 

Justice O’Connor wrote the opinion of the Court. The first question that she addressed in Hamdi was whether it was lawful to detain Hamdi, and it was a statutory question, and it was a question whether—it was whether he was being detained in violation of what is often referred to as the anti-detention statute, which was passed to prevent a repetition of the Japanese intern-ment that occurred during World War II, and she concluded that the authorization for the use of military force constituted authorization for detention. And then she went on to the issue of the constitutional procedures that would have to be followed before someone could be detained, and she looked to standard procedural due process law in this area, and identified some of the requirements that would have to be followed before someone could be detained.And now issues have arisen about the identity of the tribunal that is to make a determination about detaining people who are taken into custody during the war on terrorism, and that’s one of the issues that’s working its way through the court system.

In addressing the statutory question I don’t think she had any need to get into Justice Jackson’s framework as well.

I think it certainly is consistent with what Justice Jackson said.

I think that the war powers are divided between the executive branch and Congress. I think that’s a starting point to look at in this area. The President is the Commander in Chief, and he has authority in the area of foreign affairs, and is recognized in Supreme Court decisions as the sole organ of the country in conducting foreign affairs.

Well, I’m trying to explain my understanding of the division of authority in this area, and I think that it’s divided between the executive and the Congress. I certainly don’t think that the President has a blank check in time of war. He does have the responsibility as the Commander in Chief, which is an awesome responsibility.

I think that the considerations that inform the theory of the unitary Executive are still important in determining, in deciding separation of powers issues that arise in this area. Of course, when questions come up involving the power of removal, which was the particular power that I was talking about in thetalk that you’re referring to, those are now governed by a line of precedents from Myers going through Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener and Morrison, where the Court held 8–1 that the removal restrictions that were placed on an independent counsel under the Independent Counsel Act did not violate separation of powers principles. So those would be applied. Those would be the governing precedents on the question of removal, but my point in the talk was that the considerations that underlie this theory are relevant, should inform decisionmaking in the area going beyond the narrow question of removal.

Morrison is a settled—is a precedent of the Court. It was an 8–1 decision. It’s entitled to respect under stare decisis. It concerns the Independent Counsel Act, which no longer is in force.

No. I don’t think that was ever my position. 

I don’t see any connection between the concept of a unitary Executive and the weight that should be given to signing statements in interpreting statutes. I view those as entirely separate questions. The question of the unitary Executive, as I was explaining yesterday, does not concern the scope of Executive powers. It concerns who controls whatever power the Executive has. You could have an Executive with very narrow powers and still have a unitary Executive. So those are entirely different questions. The scope of Executive power gets into the question of inherent Executive power. 

Senator, I don’t think I have ever said that—I don’t think I’ve ever challenged the constitutionality of independent agencies. My understanding—

Senator, I don’t think I’ve ever said that either. I said that I thought that there was merit to the theory of the unitary Executive, and I tried to explain how I thought that should play out in the post-Morrison world, accepting Morrison as the Supreme Court’s latest decision in a resounding 8–1 decision on the issue of removal. How should the issue of—how should the concept of the unitary Executive play out in the post-Morrison world?On the issue of removal, my understanding of where the law stands now is that Myers established that there are certain officers of the executive branch whom the President has the authority to remove as he sees fit. There are—and there are those—

Well, that was the issue that was presented by the Tenure in Office Act that led to the impeachment of the first President Johnson, and in Myers, Chief Justice Taft, although the Act of that controversy was long past, Chief Justice Taft opined that the Tenure in Office Act had been unconstitutional.

What Morrison says is that Congress can place restrictions on the removal of inferior officers, provided that those removal restrictions don’t interfere with the President’s exercise of Executive authority. So they adopted a functional approach, and that was the Court’s latest word on this question. They looked back to Humphrey’s Executor, and Wiener, which had talked about categories, and they—categories of quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative officers, and they reformulated this as a functional approach, and that’s the approach that would now be applied.

I don’t think— 

I don’t think the President is above the law, and the President is the head of the executive branch, and I’ve ex-plained my understanding of the removal restrictions that can and cannot be placed on officers of the executive branch.

Well, you’d have to look at the facts of the case and the particular officer that we’re talking about.

The President is subject to constitutional restrictions, and he cannot lawfully direct the FBI or anybody in the Justice Department or anybody else in the executive branch to do anything that violates the Constitution.

My answer to that is the same thing. He has to follow the Constitution and the laws of the United States. He has to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. If a statute is unconstitutional, then the President—then the Constitution would trump the statute. But if a statute is not unconstitutional then the statute is binding on the President and everyone else.

If the matter is later challenged in court, of course, the President isn’t going to have the last word on that question, that’s for sure. And the courts would exercise absolutely independent judgment on that question. It’s emphatically the duty of the courts to say what the law is when constitutional questions are raised in cases that come before the courts.

Well, the independent agencies are governed by Humphrey’s Executor and cases that follow that, and there have been restrictions placed on the removal of commissioners of the independent agencies, and they have been sustained by the Supreme Court. That’s where the Supreme Court precedent on the issue stands.

It is a line of precedent that culminated, I would say—there have been a few additional cases relating to this, the Edmond case and the Freitag case, but I would look to Morrison, which was an 8–1 decision involving a subject of considerable public controversy, the removal of an independent counsel, removal of restrictions on that independent counsel. 

Well, Magnesium Electron presented the question of whether we had a case or controversy under Article III, and that’s the fundamental limit on our jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has said that we do not have a case or controversy before us if we do not have a party that has constitutional standing which requires injury in fact. And the issue was whether the plaintiffs in that case had established injury in fact. There was a plant that was discharging certain things into a creek, which eventually emptied into the Delaware River, and the plaintiffs in the case alleged that they enjoyed the Delaware River in a variety of ways. They ate fish from the river. They drank water from the river. They walked along the river.But there was no—there was nothing in the evidence—and Judge Lewis agreed on this. Judge Roth wrote the opinion and I agreed with Judge Roth, and Judge Lewis agreed with us on this point, there was nothing in the record.

The evidence that was before us did not show that there was any standing on the part of the plaintiffs. There was no evidence of harm to the Delaware River in any way from the discharges and that was the basis of Judge Roth’s opinion which with I agreed. As I recall, Judge Lewis’s point was that the case should go back to the district court so that the plaintiffs could have an opportunity to present additional evidence. But as I recall, they were not even arguing before us that they had additional evidence. They were not arguing before us, as I recall, that we have additional evidence and we’d like the opportunity to go back to the district court to present it. That’s my recollection of the matter.

Well, Laidlaw is a precedent on the Supreme Court and my answer to the question there is the same. It’s entitled to the respect of stare decisis.

I felt the result was dictated by Supreme Court precedent, and I wasn’t the only one who thought that. That was a unanimous decision of our panel. Judge McKee and, I believe, Judge Fulham from the District Court in Philadelphia were on thatpanel. They all agreed, and it is my recollection that seven other courts of appeals have decided the case the same way. More than 20 court of appeals—that issue the same way. More than 20 court of appeals judges, including judges appointed by all recent Presidents, have reached that decision.I think when you look at the law and the facts of the case, it becomes clear why there is so much unanimity on the question. Whether one likes the test or not, the test that we in the lower courts have to apply in this area is the congruence and proportionality test from City of Boerne, and therefore, what we had to do was to see whether there was a record of discrimination relating to the particular provision that was at issue in Chittister, which had to do with leave for personal illness. So there would have to be some evidence that State employers had given more leave for personal illness to men than women, or more leave for personal illness to women than men, and there was no evidence whatsoever on this issue. That’s why all of these courts of appeals reached the conclusion that they did in Chittister.

No, it is not a correct expression of my views. The President, like everybody else, has to follow the Constitution and the laws. He has to follow the Constitution at all times and he has to follow all the laws that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. That’s clear.Now, on the Mitchell v. Forsythe case, which they may be referring to, that was simply—I was simply saying that a certain argument relating to immunity from civil damages was an argument that had been made before and it was an argument that was being requested by our client in the case who was being sued in his individual capacity, and I recommended that we not make the argument, but I said, I don’t dispute this argument, and that’s all that was involved there.

Well, I reject that. I believe very strongly in treating everybody who comes before me absolutely equal. I take that oath very seriously and I have tried to do my very best to abide by that during my 15 years on the bench.Now, I don’t think a judge should be keeping a scorecard about how many times the judge votes for one category of litigant versus another in particular types of cases. That would be wrong. We are supposed to do justice on an individual basis in the cases that come before us. But I think that if anybody looks at the categories of— looks at the cases that I have voted on in any of the categories of cases that have been cited, they will see that there are decisions on both sides. In every type of employment discrimination case, for example, there are decisions on both sides.

Most of them are, yes. 

No, that is correct, Senator. 

We have to decide the cases on the facts that are in the record and the law that applies. 

I dissented from a majority decision that held that Mr. Zubi, who was claiming racial discrimination, would not have his day in court because of the statutory—

I would have, yes— 

Yes. 

That is right. That was essentially a case of racial profiling and I wrote an opinion holding that that was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. 

That’s correct, Senator. 

I do, yes. 

Well, that was a case where I think that the Supreme Court thought that my opinion had gone too far in favor of the little guy who was involved there. That was a— 

That’s right, a woman who was trying to get— 

That’s right. As the case was presented to us, the only job that she could perform was her past job, which was as an elevator operator, and what I said was that you can’t deny somebody Social Security benefits because the person is able to do a job that no longer exists in any substantial numbers in the national economy. You can’t deny benefits based on a hypothetical job. It has to be based on a real job. And the Supreme Court didn’t see it that way, but it seems to me that the way we ruled was consistent with what I thought— 

That’s right.

‘‘Fatten,’’ I think. 

I think that was one of the first cases in the Federal courts to hold that requiring a woman to be returned to a country where she would have to wear a veil and conform to other practices like that would amount to persecution if that was deeply offensive to her and that subjecting a woman to persecution in Iran or any other country to which she would be returned based on feminism would be persecution on the basis of political opinion. 

That is what I’ve tried to do. 

That’s right, Senator. 

Well, I don’t think initial service means 12 years away— 

Yes. I think that it is important for a multi-member court to issue a judgment and to speak clearly to the lower courts and the parties. And so when I’ve been in a position where taking an independent position would result in the absence of a judgment. I had gone out of my way to make sure that there was a judgment, that there was a majority opinion. An example of that is the Rappa case where we were really divided three ways, and my position was close to Judge Becker’s opinion, and Judge Becker had the opinion-writing assignment, and I issued an opinion saying, ‘‘I don’t completely agree with the way Judge Becker analyzed this issue. I would analyze it differently. But I’m joining his opinion so that there is a majority opinion, so that there is a clear statement of the law for the guidance of the parties.’’ I think that’s the first principle.Second is that judges should be respectful of each other’s views, and I don’t have any—I have tried never to write a dissenting opinion or respond in a majority opinion to a dissenting opinion in a way that was not completely respectful of the views of the other members of the court.It’s useful to dissent if there’s a chance that the case may go en banc, and that’s happened in a number of cases where I’ve dissented. It’s useful to dissent if there is a chance that the case may go to the Supreme Court and so that the Supreme Court will have the benefit of a different expression of views, and there have been cases—

Well, Senator— 

Well, Senator, the statement that I—the nature of the question that I was responding to did not figure in the way the Monga case was handled, and I thought I made that clear yesterday. I was following throughout my time on the bench the practice of going beyond the code, and had I focused on this issue when the matter came before me, I would have recused myself at that time, as I later did. But in answer to Senator Hatch’s question, looking at that question today and looking at the answer, the question was: What do you intend to do during your initial period of service? And I think that that’s what the answer has to be read as responding to. But just to be clear, that was not—I’m not saying that that’s why this played out the way it did. I’m just saying that’s how I think the question and the answer—that’s how I think the question and any response to the answer by any nominee needs to be interpreted. 

Well, Senator, I— 

Senator, I did not rely on that time limitation in relation to what I did in the Monga case, and I hope I have made that clear. If I didn’t in my previous answer, I do want to make it clear. I did not rely on that in my handling of the Monga case. Looking at the question now, where it says ‘‘initial period of service,’’ I would say that 12 years late is not the initial period of service. But that was not— 

Well, Senator, I don’t— 

I can’t specifically recall what was in my mind at that time, but I’ll tell you what I’m pretty sure I had in mind. I was not a judge, and I was being considered for a judicial position. And what I was trying to express was basically the policy that I followed during all my years on the bench, which is to bend over backwards to make sure that I didn’t do anything that came close to violating the code of conduct or give anybody the impression that I was doing anything that was improper. 

Senator, as I said— 

And, Senator, as I said, I can’t tell you 15 years later exactly what I thought when I read that question. It refers to the initial period of service, and looking at it now, it doesn’t seem to me that 12 years later is the initial period of service. 

Well, I don’t know exactly what the time limitation would be, but 12 years does seem to me not to be the initial period. 

I have no specific recollection of joining the organization.

Well, what I said specifically was that I racked my memory as to why I might have joined, and the issue that had bothered me for a period of time as an undergraduate and in the 1980s, around the time of this—when I made this statement, was the issue of ROTC. This was the issue about the administration of Princeton that bothered me. I had a high regard for Princeton in many respects in general and had participated in a lot of their activities. But this issue bothered me a great deal at various times. That’s what I said.

Senator, what I specifically said, as I recall, is that if I had done anything substantial in relation to this group, including renewing my membership, I would remember that. And I do not remember that.

I don’t recall seeing the magazine. I might— 

I have been—I have learned of that in recent weeks. 

I feel confident that I didn’t. If that—I am not familiar with the article, and I don’t have a context in which those things were said. But they are antithetical to— 

It’s hard to imagine. If that’s what anybody was endorsing, I disagree with all of that. I would never endorse it. I never have endorsed it. Had I thought that that’s what this organization stood for, I would never associate myself with it in any way. 

I feel confident that I didn’t, Senator, because I would not have anything to do with statements of that nature. 

I don’t think I was aware of that until recent weeks when I was informed of it. 

I was not aware of it until very recently. 

I don’t believe that I saw the article. 

Senator, I testified to everything that I can recall relating to this and I do not recall knowing any of these things about the organization, and many of the things that you’ve mentioned are things that I have always stood against. In your description of the letter that prompted President Bowen’s letter, there is talk about returning the Princeton that used to be. There is talk about eating clubs, about all-male eating clubs. There is talk about the admission of alumni children. There is opposition to opening up the admissions process.None of that is something that I would identify with. I was not the son of an alumnus. I was not a member of an eating club. I was not a member of an eating facility that was selective. I was not a member of an all-male eating facility and I would not have identified with any of that. If I had received any information at any point regarding any of the matters that you have referred to in relation to this organization, I would never have had anything to do with it.

Senator, whatever I knew about this organization in 1985, I identified as conservative. I don’t identify those views as conservative. What I do recall as an issue that bothered me in relation to the Princeton administration as an undergraduate and continuing into the 1980s was their treatment of the ROTC unit and their general attitude toward the military, which they did not treat with the respect that I thought was deserving. The idea that it was beneath Princeton to have an ROTC unit on campus was an offensive idea to me.

Senator—I’m sorry. 

It’s my recollection that this was a continuing source of controversy. There were people on the campus, members of the faculty, as I recall, who wanted the unit removed from the campus. There was certainly controversy about whether students could get credit for courses, which I believe was a military requirement for the maintenance of the unit. There was controversy, as I recall, about the status of the instructors, whether they could be given any kind of a status in relation to the faculty. I don’t know the exact dates, but it’s my recollection that this was a continuing source of controversy. 

They’re not my documents, Senator, and I have no— 

Senator, I don’t believe I had any active involvement with this group. 

I have racked my memory and I can’t recall anything, and if I had been involved actively in any way in the group, I’m sure that I would remember that. 

Every person has equal rights under the law in this country, and that involves people who have no money—that includes people who have no money. That includes people who do not hold any higher or prestigious position. It includes people who are citizens and people who are not citizens. Everybody is entitled to be treated equally under the law, and I think that’s one of the greatest things about our country and about our legal system.

I never disagreed with that principle, Senator. What I disagreed with when I was in college was the application of the principle in some of the—the elaboration of the principle in some of the late Warren Court decisions, and this grew out of my father’s work with the New Jersey legislature. He had been the Secretary to the State Constitutional Convention in 1966, which redrew the provisions of the State Constitution relating to the composition of the legislature in an effort to bring it into compliance with the one person/one vote standard.These provisions, however, because they tried to respect county and municipal lines, as I recall, resulted in population deviations of under 10 percent, but those deviations were much higher than the ones that the Supreme Court said in the late decisions that I’m talking about would be tolerated regarding congressional districts. There was a belief that that principle would be applied across the board, both to congressional districts and to legislative districts, and that would have wiped out the plan that had been adopted. And I was quite familiar with all of this, and it seemed to me an instance of taking a good principle, which is one person/one vote, and taking it to extremes, requiring that districts be exactly equal in population, which did not seem to me to be a sensible idea.

Those words are not in my statement. 

Just to add, Senator, that this issue of how nearly exact the districts had to be was an issue that was working its way to the Supreme Court or maybe it had actually been there—I’ve forgotten the exact chronology—at the time of the 1985 statement in Karcher v. Daggett, which involved the New Jersey Congressional districting plan. 

I do. I think it’s a fundamental part of our constitutional law. 

Well, it can be very relevant in many instances. One place where this has come up is when a statute was passed by the 1st Congress—and this has happened on a number of occasions. The 1st Congress, which was responsible for the Bill of Rights, passed a number of statutes relating to provisions of the Bill of Rights, and the Supreme Court has often looked to those and said this is the same Congress that proposed the Bill of Rights, and they did this in enacting a statute, so that gives us a good indication of what they had in mind. And when there has been a legal practice that has existed for—that predated the Constitution, then that certainly is relevant in considering its constitutionality.

I have often looked to legislative history in the cases that I’ve written concerning statutory interpretation. And I think if anybody looks at those opinions, they will see that.When I interpret a statute, I do begin with the text of the statute. I think that certainly is the clearest indication of what Congress as a whole had in mind in passing the statute. And sometimes the language of the statute is dispositive and it is really—the decision can be made based on the language of the statute itself.But when there is an ambiguity in the statute, I think it is entirely legitimate to look to legislative history, and as I said, I have often done that. I think it needs to be done with caution. Just because one Member of Congress said something on the floor, obviously that doesn’t necessarily reflect the view of the majority who voted for the legislation. So it has to be done carefully and I think with a realistic evaluation of the legislative process, but I’m not one of the judges who thinks that you should never look to legislative history. I think it has its place.

Well, the issue hasn’t come up before me. I have a little bit of familiarity with the arguments. And I don’t think I— I think that all I can say on the question is that the qui tam statute is of historical origin, as you pointed out, and we have seen what it has produced in terms of tangible results in the cases that have been brought under the statute in recent years. And should an issue relating to its constitutionality come before me, either on the Third Circuit or the Supreme Court, then I would have to follow that whole judicial process that I’ve described and evaluate the arguments and certainly study the question much more thoroughly than I have done up to this point.

I’m quite sure I’ve never written or spoken about its constitutionality.

I certainly don’t, Senator. 

I do, and I understand that’s a very strong argument. I remember that I found that a very difficult issue to deal with, and I spent a lot of time on it, and my view of the matter elicited a strong and a very persuasive, I think, dissent by one of my colleagues. So it is a tough issue, and if that were to come up again, I would have to really reconsider it.

Well, I think what you look at is the group that is required to notify. You don’t look at the group that’s not required to notify, so unmarried women are not examined here because the notification requirement obviously does not apply to them.Then my understanding of Justice O’Connor’s standard, which was the ‘‘more than some woman’’ standard, let me put it that way, although she didn’t put it quite that strongly. She said that it is insufficient that some women are inhibited from having an abortion as a result of the requirement. So you look at the people who are affected by—who are within the scope of the provision, and then you would see how many of the people within the scope of the provision would be inhibited from having an abortion as a result of what was involved. You don’t look at people who aren’t regulated at all, and you don’t just look at the people who would be inhibited because both of those would not be the right thing to look at.So in the case of—let’s take the case of the informed consent requirement. You’d look at everybody who was required to receive the information that was within the informed consent provision, and then you would ask how many of the people, how many of the women who were regulated by this, would be inhibited from having an abortion as a result of the requirement. That was my understanding and that is my understanding of what she was talking about.

Thornburgh concerned— 

Well, she was setting our her understanding of what the standard was, of the Undue Burden Standard. Now, in Thornburgh there were several provisions of a previous version of the Pennsylvania statute at issue. There was an informed consent provision, as I recall. There was a provision relating to health insurance. There was a provision relating to notification of a minor’s parents. There were a number of provisions involved. And my recollection is that when she made the statement, she was talking about the Undue Burden Standard itself. It was an explanation of what she meant by the Undue Burden Standard. 

No. The informed consent provision presented an easier—easier isn’t even the right word—a less difficult question than the spousal notification provision. I don’t think there’s any question about that. They both involved the same standard, which was the Undue Burden Standard. And therefore, I thought—and I still think that’s what’s said in reference to one provision is relevant in determining what the standard was.The big issue, when this case was before us, was whether the standard was undue burden or not. It’s funny how cases look different after they’ve progressed through the Supreme Court than they do when they’re first presented to the court of appeals. That was the most hotly contested argument before us. Had there been any change in the Supreme Court’s case law—and the plaintiffs argued strenuously that there had not—but our panel, after some effort, determined under the Marks standard for determining what the holding of a case is when there’s no majority opinion, that the standard was the Undue Burden Standard. And there just wasn’t a lot to go on. I think I said that yesterday. I looked for whatever guidance I could find.

Yes. Hibbs concerned a provision that required employers to give employees leave to be out of work to take care of a family member. And there was a record that employers, State employers had given more leave for this purpose to women than they had to men, and that was based on the stereotype that when somebody in the family gets sick and somebody has to leave work to take care of the family member, it’s the woman and not the man, and it reinforced the stereotype, of course, because having such a policy would encourage, would put pressure on women to leave for this purpose, as opposed to the man. If there was a woman and a man in the family, and somebody had to leave work to take care of a sick family member, and you have a plan like this, this is going to pressure the woman to do that. So the Hibbs court found that that was a sufficient record of gender discrimination to justify the passage of legislation under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment.Chittister concerned a provision that related to leave for personal illness, and there’s no reason to think that men or women get sick more often one than the other, or what was to the point, that State employers had given men more sick time than women, or women more sick time than men. And so with that record, it was the conclusion of my court, and I believe seven other circuits, that this was a different issue. These cases were decided before and after Hibbs and that could not be justified if you accept the Congruence and Proportionality Standard.

I’m quite certain it never was. I would have made a reference to it in the opinion if that had been mentioned. I am not aware of that coming up in the other circuit opinions on the issue. We are, to a degree—we can’t know everything about the real world, and we’re dependent on the arguments that are presented to us to a degree. I don’t believe that argument was ever presented.

Well, Senator, as I said, I don’t have a recollection of having anything to do with CAP, so all I can say is that I put it down on the ’85 form and therefore I must have been a member at around that time, and that’s—I can’t—

Well, I wasn’t. 

Well, Senator, I wasn’t a member of that club as you refer to it. By the time I entered Princeton, there were many minorities in my class. The practice of not including minorities had ended, and my class was not coeducational when we were admitted, and as I said yesterday, I had never previously attended a noncoeducational school— 

I was admitted in 1968. It was not coeducational. It went coeducational while I was there— 

Well, Senator, I don’t recall joining, but I do remember that that was the issue relating to the administration that was bothering me for a period of time, including that period. 

No, Senator. 

I do. I deplore those things. 

I disavow it. I would never associate myself with those things. 

Absolutely not. I would never be a member of an organization that took those positions. 

I don’t know—I’m not familiar with the statistics. The way the appeals system is set up, the types of—I think that’s what results in the statistics that you mentioned, the low rate of success for plaintiffs, because these cases are generally cases in which summary judgment has been granted for the defendant. If the district court denies summary judgment for the defendant, then the case will go to trial and very often is settled, or there’s a trial and then there’s no appeal after the trial. So the cases that we get, most of the cases that we get are cases that have been looked at by a conscientious district judge and found not to be cases that should go to trial and I think that’s what produces those statistics. 

There certainly are cases that may come before the Supreme Court. There is a case involving abortion before the Court this term, and they come up with some regularity. Many of them involve the application of Roe. Most of them involve the application of Roe or the application of other precedents that build on Roe. But it is entirely possible that a case involving Roe itself could come up at some point in the future.

In my mind, the most important reason is that to do that would undermine the entire judicial decisionmaking process. We have a process for deciding legal issues and it is critically important that we stick to that process, and that means that when an issue comes before us, the briefs are not a formality. The arguments of the attorneys are not a formality. We should read those very carefully and we should study the issue and we should study all the authorities that are cited to us and carefully consider all of the arguments that are presented to us, both in the briefs and in the attorneys’ oral presentation, and then go into the conference and discuss the case among the members of the court, and we shouldn’t decide legal questions without questions that are going to—not just abstract questions as if we were in a constitutional law seminar, but cases that are going to have an impact on the real world. We shouldn’t decide those questions even in our own minds without going through that whole process.If we announce—if a judge or a judicial nominee announced before even reading the briefs or getting the case or hearing the argument what he or she thought about the ultimate legal issue, all of that would be rendered meaningless and people would lose all their respect for the judicial system, and with justification, because that is not the way in which members of the judiciary are supposed to go about the work of deciding cases.

It was Justice Blackman. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I think it’s important to draw a distinction between issues that could realistically come up before the courts and issues that are very much, that are still very much in play— which is to say, the subject of litigation in the courts. And I felt comfortable about commenting on one person, one vote and, of course, Brown v. Board of Education because those are not issues that are any longer the subject of litigation in our country, not the fundamental principles that are embodied in those decisions. And the Griswold case, likewise, concerns an issue that is not realistically likely to come before the courts. Roe, on the other hand, involves an issue that is involved in a considerable amount of litigation before the courts, and so that’s where I feel that I must draw the line, because on issues that could realistically come up, it would be improper for me to express a view and I would not reach a conclusion regarding any issue like that before going through the whole judicial process that I described. 

Well, what I would do if a case like that were to come before me, and if I’m confirmed, is to follow the two-step process that I’ve talked about, which is first to consider the issue of stare decisis. And there’s been a considerable body of case law now on this issue going back to Roe and, in particular over the last 20 years, and in the Casey opinion, that was where the joint opinion began and the joint opinion ended. And then only if I got beyond that issue would I consider the underlying issue. And that’s what I would do if the issue were to come up. And I don’t believe that it would be appropriate and it wouldn’t even be realistic for me to go further than that.

Well, in light of the current state of litigation relating to the issue of abortion—and as I said, there’s an abortion case before the Supreme Court this term and there are undoubtedly abortion cases before the lower Federal courts; I know there are— I don’t believe that it’s appropriate for me to go further than that in relation to that issue.

Senator, you mentioned a number of things and I’ve tried to jot them down so that I could cover at least the major things that you mentioned.You mentioned—and I guess I’ll take these in reverse order of chronology—you mentioned the statement in the 1985 statement relating to reapportionment. And I’ve tried to explain what I had in mind. The statement in the ’85 statement talked about what I thought about reapportionment when I was in college. And the reason why I mentioned that—why would I mention what I thought about constitutional law in college before I’d even been to law school?What I was attempting to do was to explain the development of my thinking about the role of the judiciary and about constitutional law and, in particular my development of my strong belief in judicial self-restraint. And the first place in which I saw a theoretical explanation of that doctrine, which I found persuasive at the time, was Alexander’s Bickel’s book, ‘‘The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress,’’ which came out during the time when I was in college. I think it was the first book about constitutional theory, soto speak, that I had read. And he addressed the issue of one person, one vote, and that linked up in my mind with the experiences of my father in working on the reapportionment of the New Jersey legislature.And at the time when I was in college, there was an issue that was very much a live issue at the time as to what one person, one vote meant. Did it mean that you took this principle of one person, one vote and applied it with blinding literalness so that every district was exactly equal in population, or very close to that, with a population deviation of under 1 percent, or could other factors that people thought were legitimate factors to be considered in drawing districts, such as respecting county lines and municipal lines; was it permissible to take those into account? That’s what I know I was thinking about reapportionment back in my college days.I referred in the statement to traditional values, and I said yesterday at this point in 2006, I can’t say for sure exactly what was on my mind in 1985, when I made reference to traditional values. But I tried to describe some of the things that I probably thought were traditional—thought of as traditional values, and I listed a number of them. One—and a lot of them had to do with the ability of people to live and raise a family in the sort of neighborhood where I grew up. And I gave a little description of that earlier.So it would include things like being able to live in peace and safety. I think that’s a traditional value, and that was very much at stake when I was in college in the late ’60s and early ’70s and in 1985, because these were eras of high crime. And a lot of the work that I had done up to 1985 as an assistant U.S. attorney and working on criminal cases in the Solicitor General’s Office seemed to me to be involved with this issue of protecting people from the threat of crime.I think I mentioned the ability to raise children the way you want, to instill your values, not to have them subject to certain external threats. And these were—you know, I’ve tried to think of why would these have been at issue in the mid-80s. And they were at issue because of things like some of the things I was referring to earlier today about children being able to, and students being able to express their religious views at school in a nondiscriminatory way, so that religious speech was not discriminated against. And that was very much at issue in the ’80s. Congress passed the Equal Access Act at about that time to embody that principle.So those were some of the things that came to my mind as traditional values.The 1985 statement in reference to abortion, I have not distanced myself from it. I have said that that was a correct expression of what I thought in 1985 when I wrote it. It was written in 1985, and that was 20 years ago. And there’s been a lot of case law in the intervening years. There was Thornburgh and there was Webster and Casey, all of which involved direct challenges to Roe, and there were other cases applying Roe.So that’s what I had in mind with respect to the matters that you’ve covered.

On the discrimination cases, Senator, I think that the statistic that Senator Kyl just cited speaks directly to that, a comparison of the number of times in which people claiming discrimination prevailed in the cases won my vote compared to the average for circuit judges in general. And I think that those statistics—that my statistics and the statistics for circuit judges in general have to be viewed against the background of—have to be viewed with a recognition of the way in which these discrimination cases come up through the court system. Most of them are cases in which the person claiming the violation lost in the district court, and that means that a district court judge—and they are not always right, but most of the time they are right. And they are conscientious people, and they apply the same law that we do. They found that these were not meritorious cases. And so if you start out with a group of cases that have already been found to be not meritorious, it stands to reason that probably not a very high percentage of them will ultimately be found to be meritorious.On the immigration cases, I take very seriously—and I don’t know what the statistics are in this area, but I can tell you this, that I take very seriously the scope of review that I am supposed to perform as an appellate judge. And that is usually dictated by Congress, and in the area of immigration, Congress has spoken clearly. And as to factual decisions that are made by an immigration judge, what Congress has told us is you are not to disturb those unless no reasonable fact finder could have reached the conclusion that the immigration judge did. And I very often see a record where I think it’s doubtful. I say to myself, ‘‘I might havedecided this differently if I were the immigration judge.’’ But I wasn’t there. I didn’t see the witnesses testify personally. And Congress has told me what my role is there. My role is not to substitute my judgment for that of the immigration judge. My job is to say, Could a reasonable person have reached the conclusion that the immigration judge did? And if I find that a reasonable person could have reached that conclusion, then it’s my job to deny the petition for review. And that’s what I do in those instances.

I certainly don’t have any concerns about the decision in Olmstead. I would have to look at my own file in the Helen L. case—and I doubt that there is any file in the case at this point—to try and see if there’s anything in there to indicate specifically why I voted for rehearing in the case. And perhaps if—but I can say this: that I read the decision again, and one important partof the opinion in the case attempts to distinguish an earlier Third Circuit case that seemed to be somewhat closely related—closely related to the issue that was at hand. And I noted there were five votes for rehearing in the case, and that’s quite unusual. It’s unusual for there to be that many votes for rehearing.Most of the time—I would say most of the time when we vote for rehearing, the reason is because we think that there may be an inconsistency in our court case law, and that doesn’t necessarily mean that we think that the decision we’re voting to rehear was incorrect. Quite often, we think the decision that we are voting to reconsider is correct, but that it is inconsistent with a prior case that needs to be overruled, and we are very scrupulous about following our own precedents, not ignoring them. So if we have a precedent out there and it seems to us to be wrong and the issue comes up in a later case, then our mechanism is to vote to rehear.That happens very often, and my guess, based on what I can tell just from reading the opinion and looking at the votes for rehearing and the judges who voted for rehearing, is that could have been what was going on.

Well, let me preface what I’m going to say by saying that I’m not an antitrust expert and so I plod my way through these antitrust issues when they come up. But this was a tough one and it was a monopolization case and it required an examination of all the factors that were relevant to a determination of whether 3M was engaging in monopolization.3M was selling the product, as I recall, it was selling these products—it was not selling them below its cost. It was selling them above its cost, but 3M was—because of its scale or because it was more efficient, was able to produce its product more cheaply. I remember looking at the authorities that had discussed this and the writing of leading antitrust experts on bundling issues and that factor, taken together with the other factors in the case, persuaded Judge Greenberg and I, and we were the majority on the case at the panel level, that there wasn’t sufficient evidence of monopolization here. And then when the case went en banc, the court as a whole came out the other way.But my understanding of the state of the scholarship on this issue right now and on the way economists view the issue is that I believe that, or many of them who believe that this is—a situation like this is not—does not involve monopolization. This is not a way in which a company like that can engage in a predatory practice over a period of time. But there is uncertainty, really, about how the monopolization standard applies to issues of bundling. So I think it’s quite up in the air, and should it come up again, I think it merits reexamination.

In all the areas that you mentioned, there is now a considerable body of case law, and that is a real limitation on the exercise of judicial power. That is one of the important reasons for the doctrine of stare decisis. In the 78th Federalist Paper, when Alexander Hamilton was responding to the people who were worried about this power of judicial review, who thought that it would give the judiciary too much power, he specifically cited the fact that members of the judiciary would be bound up by precedent and this would restrain them. This would keep them from injecting their own views into the decisionmaking process.Under the Fourth Amendment, there is an enormous body of case law now and there are many types of searches that are—it’s established in case law that a warrant is required. There are types of searches where it’s established now that the activity can be conducted with reasonable suspicion, a Terry stop, for example, other types of searches require probable cause. And there are many spe-cialized types of searches, administrative searches, roadblocks constructed for certain purposes, border searches, and so forth.Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment, there is a great body of case law on procedural due process and most of the due process issues involve procedural due process, what sort of process is required. There is a standard for cases involving the substantive component of that.Under the Eighth Amendment, since the Supreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia ruled that the death penalty is permissible under certain circumstances, there is a very large body and a complex body of case law within which a judge would work in deciding cases in that field.

I think that freedom of speech and freedom of the press and all the freedoms set out in the First Amendment are matters of the utmost importance. Freedom of speech is not only important for its own said, but it is vital to the preservation of our form of government, and I think that if anybody reviews that opinions that I’ve written in the area of freedom of expression and other First Amendment—

—they will see that I strongly support those rights. The issue of speech in particular places is a daunting issue. The Supreme Court has addressed it by developing the forum doctrine, and they have identified what they call a public forum, which would be something like a public street, where people’s ability to speak is at the maximum. At the other extreme, there is a private forum. My chambers would be a private forum. A Senator’s office would be a private forum. Someone would not have a right to come in from the street and speak in a place like that. And then there are what they call limited public forums or dedicated public forums or fora, places where people can speak freely, but only at particular times on particular subjects, a place that is dedicated to free speech but only on a particular subject, for example. That is the way they analyze it. Now, some people would say that there are developments in society that have resulted in the shrinking of public fora that make it more difficult for people to express themselves. I know that I’m not up to date on New Jersey case law under the New Jersey Constitution, but it’s my belief that our State has read this—has a different forum doctrine in things like shopping centers. Malls that are privately owned are considered to be public fora under a New Jersey State law. I think some other States view it that way and that’s a competing way of looking at this problem. An important principle where I have dealt with this in my cases, as I can recall, is the issue of freedom of speech in a limited public forum, and even in a limited public forum, what government cannot do is engage in viewpoint discrimination. If the government opens up a particular forum for discussion of a particular subject, it can’t say, but we’re not going to allow—we’re only going to allow people who express this viewpoint and not another viewpoint. Viewpoint discrimination really goes to the heart of what the First Amendment is intended to prohibit, so that even in a limited public forum where people are restricted with respect to what—the subject that they can talk about, government can’t impose a viewpoint discrimination. 

Well, there’s a debate about how much protection commercial speech should have. There are those who argue that the distinction between commercial speech and noncommercial speech should be eliminated. The Supreme Court views commercial speech differently, and while it is strict about any limitation regarding accurate information about prices, it limits—it permits greater restriction of commercial speech under current case law than it does with respect to other types of speech. The theory, as I understand it, is that commercial speech is more durable. At least, that’s part of the theory. In other words, there’s such a great incentive for people who are selling things to engage in advertising and other forms of commercial speech that it’s less likely to be driven out than speech on other issues where the financing may not be as extensive.In the Pitt News case, what I had to apply was the question of whether there was sufficient tailoring. There was a compelling interest for what was done there, which was to restrict advertising about alcohol in a publication that was affiliated with an educational institution. But based on the facts there, it just did not seem to be tailored at all. This was a newspaper that I think 75 percent of the people who received it, and it’s connected with the University of Pittsburgh, were people over the drinking age, and maybe even more to the point, this publication was distributed free on campus in newspaper boxes next to a number of others that contained commercial publications and they both advertised establishments and events in the area of the university and the others were full of information about alcoholic beverages and those were free, too.So while the problem of underage drinking and abusive drinking on college campuses is a very serious issue, and the Pennsylvania legislature recognized that and we certainly didn’t question that, I mean, it is an issue of critical importance, it seemed quite unrealistic to think that this regulation, which only applied to the Pitt News and not to these other publications, was tailored sufficiently.

The statement that precedent is not an inexorable command is a statement that has been in the Supreme Court case law for a long period of time, and sitting here I can’t remember what the origin of it is, but I would bet that it’s been—it certainly has been used in cases in which the Court has invoked the doctrine of stare decisis and refused to go ahead and overrule. 

Well, that is an important principle, and I—not the principle of believing everything in the Washington Post, but the principle that stare decisis is not an inexorable command, because then we would be stuck with decisions like Plessy, and they couldn’t be overruled except through a constitutional amendment. But when an issue is one that could realistically come up, the people who would be making the arguments on both sides of the issue have a right to have a judiciary of people with open minds, and that means people who haven’t announced in advance what they think about the issue, and more importantly, people who are not going to reach a conclusion in the—not going to reach a conclusion until they have gone through the judicial process. And it’s not a facade, it’s a—it’s not a meaningless exercise. It’s a very important one. 

Well, the statement covers a lot of ground, and let me try to remember the major points. I certainly agree with the point—

Certainly, I would be happy to look at it. 

Well, Senator, I certainly agree with the point that the Chief Justice made about separating any personal views he has from anything that he would do as a member of the Supreme Court. I emphatically agree with that. That’s the essence of what a judge has to do. I certainly agree that Roe and Casey and all of the other decisions in this line are precedents of the Supreme Court, and they are entitled to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis to the extent that some of the earlier decisions have been modified, and obviously, the most recent ones are the relevant provisions of the Supreme Court. I have agreed, I think, numerous times during these hearings that when a decision is reaffirmed, that strengthens its value as stare decisis. I agree that when the Supreme Court entertains a challenge to a prior decision and says, ‘‘We’re not getting to re-examination of the merits of the issue, we think stare decisis counsel against our going to that point,’’ then that is a precedent on precedent. That seems to me to be entirely logical, and we have a long line of precedents now relating to this issue. I have said I think—I have said that stare decisis is a very important legal doctrine, and that there is a general presumption that decisions of the Court will not be overruled. There needs to be a special justification for doing it, but it is not an inexorable command. 

I think that depends on what one means by the terms ‘‘well settled.’’ 

Let me just say this. As a judge on the court of appeals or if I’m confirmed as a Justice on the Supreme Court, it would be wrong for me to say to anybody who might be bringing any case before my court, ‘‘If you bring your case before my court, I’m not even going to listen to you. I’ve made up my mind on this issue. I’m not going to read your brief. I’m not going to listen to your argument. I’m not going to discuss the issue with my colleagues. Go away, I’ve made up my mind.’’ That’s the antithesis of what the courts are supposed to do, and if that’s what settled means, then I think that’s not what judges are supposed to do. We are—

I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to speak about issues that could realistically come up, and my view about Brown v. Board of Education, for example, which was one of the cases that was cited in connection with this issue about where someone in my position should draw the line, seems to me to embody a principle that is now not subject to challenge, not realistically subject to being challenged, not within the legitimate scope of constitutional debate any longer that there should be segregated racial—facilities that are segregated on the basis of race, and that’s where I’ve tried to draw the line. If an issue involves something that is in litigation, then I think it’s not appropriate for me to go further than to say that I would be—I would be very respectful of the doctrine of stare decisis, and I would not reach a decision on the underlying issue, if one were to get to it, without going through the whole decisionmaking process.

Well, it’s a precedent of the Court, and I have respect for it, and as you mentioned—and it’s governed by stare decisis, and as you mentioned, it was decided after the decision of my court in the Magnesium Electron case. And I haven’t gone back and thought about the question of whether Laidlaw creates doubt about the soundness of the decision in Magnesium Electron. If it does, then it does, and if the issue were to come up again before the Third Circuit, for example, and I sat on the issue, then I would follow Supreme Court precedent if I concluded that it was in conflict with the decision of the prior court of appeals decision.We have—our jurisdiction, under the Constitution, is limited to cases and controversies, and the Supreme Court has said that means you have to have a plaintiff who has suffered injury in fact. And although there was a disagreement on the panel about the procedure we should use going forward, everybody on the panel agreed—Judge Roth and I who were in the majority, and Judge Lewis who dissented on a procedural point that I’ll get to—that the plaintiffs in that case had not even alleged personal injury. They alleged that they enjoyed the Delaware River in a variety of ways. As I recall, they walked along the canal path, they ate fish from the river, they drank water from the river, but there was no evidence that the discharges into a creek some distance upstream from the river had had any effect whatsoever on the river, and therefore, there was nothing to support a claim that they were personally injured by the discharges of this plant.Now, there would presumably be other people who could take legal action against the plant for its violations of the law, and nobody would condone that, but our obligation under Article III is to confine ourselves to cases within our constitutional jurisdiction.

Well, there’s a constitutional issue, certainly, at the bottom of that and there are issues of jurisdiction. There are statutory issues and Congress specifies the jurisdiction of the lower courts and so Congress can give us a role in decisions of this nature or Congress can keep the Federal courts out of it and leave it to the State courts where, for the most part, issues in this area have been adjudicated. But if there is a Federal constitutional right involved, then someone may have jurisdiction—then, of course, the Federal courts have traditionally been a forum for the adjudication of Federal constitutional rights.The underlying statutory—I’m sorry, the constitutional issue is the one that the Supreme Court addressed in the Cruzan case and in the case of Washington v. Glucksburg, and this is obviously one of the most sensitive issues that comes up in our legal system and involves something that a lot of people have had to face and a lot more people are going to have to face decisions involving the end of life, and with the advances in medical technology, this is going to be a very tough issue for an awful lot of people.In Cruzan, the Court proceeded on—they said, we assume that there is a constitutional right to refuse medical treatment that a person doesn’t want, and there certainly has long been a common law right to refuse medical treatment that a person doesn’t want. If somebody gives you medical treatment and you say, ‘‘I don’t want it,’’ and they perform an operation on you or do something like that, that’s a battery under the common law and you can be sued, and the Supreme Court assumed that that was a fundamental right under due process but said that there wasn’t a violation of the right under the circumstances in Cruzan, where the State of Missouri had imposed certain restrictions—regulations that had to be complied with before a person who was comatose could be taken off life support.And then in Washington v. Glucksburg, they addressed the issue of whether there was a constitutional right to assisted suicide and they concluded that there was not, that there were—and they applied the standard to be applied under the Due Process Clause or its substantive component, whether a right is firmly rooted in the traditions of our country and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, but there were some concurring opinions that recognized that these were issues that were on the cutting edge of medical technology, let me put it that way, or they were issues on which more empirical evidence might become relevant in the future.

It is— 

It is a constitutional principle. 

That’s right, and it doesn’t have anything to do with Congress’s power to regulate the environment under the Commerce Clause. That’s a separate question. Congress—it’s totally separate. One has to do with the scope of congressional power. The other has to do with who can bring the suit. 

Well, I do, Senator, and I— 

I think I have an appreciation of people’s concerns. Certainly with respect to Kelo, which is a recent decision and I can’t comment on how I would rule on any matter concerning that, and it involves the power to take property for public use through eminent domain, I certainly understand that what occurred in that case, which, as I understand it, was the taking of the homes of people of modest means for the purpose of building a large commercial facility that would be—that was thought by the city to be beneficial to the economic welfare of the city, but this is an enormous blow to the people whose homes are being taken. People live in homes and they have a sentimental attachment to them. They have memories that are attached to the homes. They can remember what happened in particular rooms. The neighborhood means something to them, the neighbors mean something to them. The things in the home mean something to them. And taking their home away and giving them money in return, even if they get fair market value for the home, is still an enormous loss for people. So I certainly can appreciate what they feel in that respect. 

No, it’s not. 

Well, they decide constitutional questions, and the doctrine has been established since Marbury v. Madison, that’s right. 

Yes, they are. 

I think that’s undisputed, that they have a meaning. 

I think it’s undisputed that the so-called inferior courts—and I don’t particularly like the term as a judge of thecourt of appeals—but the so-called inferior courts are totally the creation of Congress.

I agree that overreaching by the courts can undermine respect for law. Our authority is based on the belief that what we are doing is different from what Congress is doing. Because otherwise, why would people tolerate our functioning? Nobody elects us. And we have a system of Government that is fundamentally democratic. It’s based on the sovereignty of the people. So how do you explain an unelected branch of Government making decisions?So all of our authority is based on the idea, which was expressed in Marbury v. Madison, that the Constitution is law. It’s not conceptually different from statutory law. And our job is to interpret the Constitution—it has a meaning—and apply it to the situations that come up.

Well, Senator, I think your policy views are much more legitimate than the policy views of the judiciary because Members of Congress are elected for the purpose of formulating and implementing public policy. And members of the judiciary are appointed for the purpose of interpreting and applying the law.

I certainly have no objection to that. 

It is vitally important that all criminal defendants receive effective representation, and I could not agree with you more strongly that this is of the utmost importance in death penalty cases where so much is at stake.In the Rompilla case that you mentioned, we had to apply the standard of review that is set out in the habeas corpus statute as revised by Congress. And where there has been a determination on the merits by the State courts on an issue like whether a defendant received effective representation within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment and where the State courts have applied the correct legal standard, we are not allowed to disturb their decision unless what they did was unreasonable.

Well, my decision, I spoke directly to the issue in the Rompilla case as I saw it when it came before me. And my evaluation of the performance of the attorneys in that case was fully set out in the opinion that I wrote. They were—one of them was a very experienced criminal defense attorney. He was the head of the public defender’s office, and there was no dispute whatsoever that this was an attorney of competence and experience and great dedication to the defendant in this case, and that attorney was assisted by another attorney in the office, and together they were extremely dedicated to this case.Now, a number of judges took a look at this. All of the Pennsylvania judiciary, with the possible exception of one justice—I can’t remember clearly whether there was one justice who disagreed— thought that there had been effective representation provided in this case.

Well, my evaluation of the facts of the case would be the same. Now, if a case came—

Well, I should add, however, that if a case came up in the future, the Supreme Court’s decision in that case is a precedent that I would have to deal with. And they—

Well, I think that the Supreme Court is correct in viewing this as a very important part of the criminal justice system, and in particular, a very important part of the representation of clients in Eighth Amendment cases.

And I think it’s entirely appropriate that there be a searching review in every case as to whether a defendant in any criminal case, but in particular, of course, in a capital case, has received the representation that the defendant is entitled to under the Sixth Amendment.

I would approach these cases under the law that the Supreme Court has established in this area, with the recognition that I have attempted to explain of how important I believe this right is in all cases and in death cases in particular. When the Supreme Court reviews a case that has come up through the Federal system, in a habeas proceeding, then the Supreme Court, just like my court, should apply the standards that are set out in the habeas corpus statute.

Well, I discussed Wiggins in Rompilla, and I thought that it was distinguishable. Wiggins, as described, as I recall it, was a case where the attorney had reason—the attorney simply didn’t conduct an investigation without any sound strategic reason for not investigating a particular matter.

I have no sense that that was wrong. I thought it was different from the Rompilla case.

I have only sat on a handful of capital cases, and in some of them I voted to uphold the death penalty, and in a number of them I voted to strike down the death penalty. In Carpenter v. Vaughn, I voted to strike down the death penalty. In the most recent death penalty case I sat on, the Bronshtein case, I voted to strike down the death penalty because of the procedure that was followed at the penalty phase in that case. In the Cruz case, I was part of a panel that vacated a decision of the district court rejecting the claim of a habeas petitioner. There have been other cases where I voted to uphold the death penalty.

I certainly share a concern that there should be a fair procedure for the selection of jurors. That certainly is a concern. The issue of the election of judges at the State level or the appointment of judges at the State level is a matter for State legislatures to decide, and within my circuit, we have three States. In New Jersey and in Delaware, the State judiciary is appointed; in Pennsylvania, the State judiciary is elected. And I’ve had the opportunity to view the work of all three of the Supreme Courts in those States, and I think they all are of a very high quality. I think the elected judges in Pennsylvania do a conscientious effort to carry out their responsibilities, and I think—I have a high regard for the judiciary in all of those States.So based on the experience of—on my experience, I think you can have highly competent and certainly conscientious State judges who are appointed and the same sort of judges who are elected. And, of course, we do have habeas corpus and it is an important— it’s important to make sure that constitutional rights are respected, and the scope of the review that we conduct under habeas is up to Congress. Congress reformulated the standards in the AEDPA, in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, limiting our review, and it’s our obligation to conduct the kind of review that Congress has indicated we should be conducting.

Those decisions applied the standard that the Supreme Court formulated sometime earlier in determining whether the imposition of the death penalty on particular categories of defendants would violate the Eighth Amendment, and they looked to evolving standards of decency. And that is a line of precedent in the Supreme Court, and those are precedents of the Supreme Court, and they’re entitled to the respect of stare decisis. 

My approach would be to work within the body of precedent that we have. As I mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court has devoted a lot of attention to this issue since 1976 when it held that the death penalty is permissible, provided that adequate procedures are implemented by the States so that the decision about who receives the death penalty and who does not is not arbitrary and capricious, so that there is a rationality to the selection process. And the rules in this area are quite complex, but I would work within the body of precedent that is available. 

If you’re required to recuse yourself if you have stock in Microsoft, even one share, you must recuse yourself. 

Certainly that’s true. 

Well, I want to be clear on my answer respecting this as it bears on the Monga case, the Vanguard case, because that’s what we’re discussing.The wording of the Senate questionnaire was not the reason for the way I settled the case, and I’ve tried—

Reading the question, it does seem to me that ‘‘initial period of service’’ is a temporal limitation.

Absolutely, and that’s under the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(C)(3) I think it is. If you have a financial interest, you must recuse yourself, and that’s, of course, a continuing obligation.

The obligation to comply with the code of conduct for Federal judges applies to every Federal judge for as long as they serve. 

It was not the reason in 2002. I do think reading the question, it has a temporal limitation. If that wasn’t the intent, I think people could read it—certainly when you say ‘‘initial period of service,’’ people will read that to mean— 

It did not have to do with what I did in the Monga case. 

No, it was not that at all. 

It is on my list today. 

Well, if I am confirmed, I will very strictly comply with the ethical obligations that apply to Supreme Court Justices.Supreme Court recusals are a bit different from recusals in the court of appeals, and so the obligation to sit when you are not recused is one that has to be considered very seriously by somebody on the Supreme Court or, I would think, on a State supreme court, for example.

Well, under the Code of Judicial Conduct, I don’t believe that I am required to recuse myself in Vanguard cases. And I would strictly comply with the ethical obligations that apply to a Supreme Court Justice.

Well, what I want to say about recusals on the Supreme Court is that the decisionmaking process on the Supreme Court, or any court with a fixed membership, a fixed number of jurists who sit on each case, recusal in that situation creates—affects the decisionmaking process because instead of having 9 Justices, you have 8, you have the potential for a tie.On the court of appeals, that is a much less significant consideration because we always sit in panels of three, we have many judges on our court and many cases, so if I don’t sit on a case involving Vanguard, it just means somebody else will sit on the case involving Vanguard, it will still be decided by a three-judge panel.

It is very important for somebody on the Supreme Court to fulfill strictly the obligation not to sit when the person should not sit, but it’s also important for—given the matters that I just discussed—for a Justice to sit if the Justice is not required to recuse.

There’s no reason why I would make such a conscious decision. I had nothing whatsoever to gain by participating in this case, and nobody has suggested that I did. This case involved some thousands of dollars. Vanguard manages billions of dollars of funds. The idea that the outcome of this case could have some effect on the mutual funds that I hold is beyond preposterous, and I don’t understand anybody to have suggested anything like that.

It’s a—the eating clubs are privately owned facilities where upperclassmen join for the purpose of taking their meals. The first 2 years, when I was there—the situation is now a bit more diversified as far as eating is concerned—but when I was there, and traditionally, the freshmen and sophomores ate in university dining halls, and then as juniors and seniors they had to find other places to eat, and these were private facilities. 

It’s one where you apply to be a member like a fraternity, and you go through a process that is somewhat similar to that, and they select you if they like you. 

No, I was not. 

I didn’t apply. 

No, I did not. 

I disavow them. I deplore them. I—they represent things that I have always stood against, and I can’t express too strongly. 

I’m not any kind of a bigot. I’m not— 

I don’t think you would, Senator. I think it’s established that prior writings of a member of the judiciary do not require the recusal of that member of the judiciary.

I do. She was an attorney, a supervisor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey. 

I did not, no. 

I did and I do. 

I am not aware of that, but I can only speak for myself. I will keep an open mind on all issues. 

That’s certainly true. 

I am not aware of a nominee like that, Senator. 

Yes. 

Senator, I can only speak for myself, and those are true expressions of what I think. 

The line that I have tried to draw, and I’ve tried to be as forthcoming as I can with the Committee. I’ve tried to provide as many answers as I could, and obviously, I’m speaking here extemporaneously in response to questions. The line that I have tried to draw is between issues that I don’t think realistically will come before the Court, and on those, I feel more freedom to respond. One person/one vote is an example of that— 

Well, it depends on which Commerce Clause cases you’re talking about. Certainly, the initial Commerce Clause cases that moved away from the pre-New Deal understanding of the Commerce Clause have been on the books for a long time. Maybe I have been more forthcoming than I should have been in some areas, and if that’s the case in providing these extemporaneous answers, I can be faulted for that. But the line that I have to draw, and I think every nominee, including Justice Ginsburg, has drawn, is to say that when it comes to something that realistically couldcome before the Court, they can’t answer about how they would decide that question. That would be a disservice to the judicial process.

Well, Senator, most of what you said is certainly correct, but I had not argued any case involving Roe before the Supreme Court.

Yes, that’s correct. 

Well, Senator, it was a general statement. It didn’t go into—it didn’t— 

It was one sentence and it certainly didn’t represent—there was no attempt— 

I don’t recall you using the word, ‘‘without exception.’’ 

Senator, it’s one—well, I’m not disputing that— 

Could I just answer that question? 

It’s one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject. 

I think the statement speaks for itself, and it’s one sentence and it’s not an effort to set out a comprehensive—

What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburgh case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburgh case—

That’s correct, but what I was talking about there was the Thornburgh case and nothing more than the Thornburgh case.

What you’ve pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decisionmaking process would have to be gone through. You’d have to know—

I was not involved in— 

And when I wrote this statement, what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburgh case, which was to write the memo that the Committee is aware of, which did not argue that Roe should be overruled. It did not argue that the Government should argue that Roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar— 

Senator, it was one— 

It was one sentence, and I think what you’re saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account. 

I think that’s very unlikely. 

Very unlikely. 

I don’t, but if I had done anything substantial in relation to this, including renewing membership or being a member over a lengthy period of time, I feel confident that I would remember that. 

I don’t. 

I was a member of some other groups, not a whole lot— 

Some other groups, yes. 

Well, I deplore all of those statements that were shown on the chart. 

I would never associate myself with those statements—

I think you have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out. I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration, and my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position. I mentioned some very minor political contributions. I didn’t mention contributions to charitable organizations, and that’s not because the contributions to charitable organizations were unimportant. It’s just that—

Well, Senator, since I don’t remember this organization, I can’t answer your question specifically, but I think that the answer to the question lies in the nature of the form that I was filling out and the things that I put. I think the illustration of the political contributions goes right to the point. Why did I mention small political contributions and not charitable contributions?

It wasn’t that the charitable contributions were less important. It was that they were not as relevant to obtaining a political position. 

I didn’t remember it. 

Senator, I have— 

I have told the Committee everything that I can about this organization, and the most important thing I want to tell the Committee is that I have no association with those comments that were made, even if they were made in letters to the editor or in articles that simply represented the views of the authors of those articles. They are not my views now. They never were my views. They represent things that I deplore. I have always deplored any form of racial discrimination or bigotry. I was never opposed to the admission of women to Princeton. After I had been there for a few months, I realized the difference between the non-coeducational atmosphere that was there and the coeducational atmos-phere that I had had throughout my prior schooling. When it came time for me to join an eating facility, I chose one that was one of the most coeducational facilities on the campus.

Not other than from seeing the witness list. 

Yes, Senator. I am who I am and I’m my own person. And I’m not like any other Justice on the Supreme Court now or anybody else who served on the Supreme Court in the past. I don’t think any jurist is a duplicate of any other jurist. I think that the Committee and anybody who’s interested in the sort of judge I am can get a very clear picture of that by looking at my record on the court of appeals. And I’ve been on the court of appeals for 15 years and have sat on over 4,000 cases. And most of the cases that come to the court of appeals never go any further. We’re the last stop in 99 percent of the cases, probably higher than that. And we know that when we’re deciding those cases.And I think if anybody reads the opinions that I’ve written and the opinions that I’ve joined, they can see exactly the sort of jurist that I am. They will find some opinions I’m sure that they will disagree with. But if they look at the whole set of opinions that I’ve written or joined, they can get a very clear picture of me. I’m not like anybody else. I don’t claim to have the abilities of some of the distinguished members of the Supreme Court now or in the past. I have my—whatever abilities that I have. But they are my own.

I have. The line I’ve tried to draw is whether something realistically could come up in litigation before the court of appeals or before the Supreme Court. And I—

I don’t. There’s no realistic possibility of that, so I felt freer to talk about something like that.

It’s an issue that is in litigation now, and I think you can look at the course of litigation over the past 20 years and you can see a number of cases—and of course this has been highlighted—in which the Supreme Court has been asked to overrule Roe and it has repeatedly refused to do that. But there’s nothing—there’s no comparable pattern, for example, with respect to Brown v. Board of Education or one person, one vote.

That’s right, and it would be a bad thing if judges started keeping these scorecards and said, oh, I’ve ruled a certain number of times in favor of one side; when the next case comes up, I’d better rule on the other side. That’s exactly what we don’t want judges to do.

Thank you, Senator. 

That is exactly correct, and I think in the speech I said there is a debate about the scope of what is meant by theExecutive power, but there isn’t any debate that the President has the power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and that was the scope of the power that I was discussing.

I don’t think that the unitary Executive has anything to do with that. Let me just say that at the outset. I think that—and if other people use that term to mean the scope of Executive power, that certainly isn’t the way that I understand—

That is not my point of view. 

No. I think— 

It is not my—the unitary—when I talk about the unitary Executive, I am talking about the President’s control over the Executive branch, no matter how big or how small, no matter how much power it has or how little power it has. To me, the issue of the scope of Executive power is an entirely different question and it goes to what can you read into simply the term ‘‘Executive.’’ That is part of it and, of course, there are some other powers that are given to the President in Article II, the commander in chief power, for example. And there can be a debate, of course, about the scope of that power, but that doesn’t have to do with the unitary Executive. 

Well, I am not coming down—I don’t recall that Justice Thomas uses the term ‘‘unitary Executive’’ in his dissent. It doesn’t stick out in my mind that he did. If he did, he is using it there in a sense that is different from the sense in which I was using the term. 

I am, and there is actually a third theory, the endorsement test. 

I don’t think the Court has settled on any single theory that it applies in every case. There are cases in which it finds the Lemon theory, the Lemon test, which now has two parts, whether the statute has—whether whatever is at issue has a secular purpose and whether the primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion. There are instances in which it applies that. It tends to apply that in cases involving funding. There is the endorsement test, and it applies that in certain cases. Typically, it applies those in cases involving things like the displaying of symbols that may have religious—that have religious significance. So it itself has not found a single test that it applies in all of these cases. 

Well, I don’t have a—I do not myself have a grand, unified theory of the Establishment Clause. As a lower court judge, of course, my job has been to apply those precedents, and this is an area in which I think the Court has been—you can just see by the number of cases that it has decided it has been attempting to find the best way of expressing its view of what the Establishment Clause requires. I certainly agree that it embodies a very important principle and one that has been instrumental in allowing us to live together successfully as probably the most religiously diverse country in the world, and maybe in the history of the world. And it’s a very important principle, but I myself do not have a grand, unified theory of this. 

Well, my personal religious beliefs are important to me in my private life. They are an important part of the way I was raised and they have been important to Martha and me in raising our children. But my obligation as a judge is to interpret and apply the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and not my personal religious beliefs or any personal moral beliefs that I have, and there is nothing about my religious beliefs that interferes withmy doing that. I have a particular role to play as a judge and that does not involve imposing any religious views that I have or moral views that I have on the rest of the country.

Yes, it does. It is freedom to worship and not worship, as you choose, and compelling somebody to worship would be a clear violation of the religion clauses of the First Amendment.

Well, that was the case that followed Lee v. Weisman and preceded the Santa Fe case, which dealt with a prayer before a football game. Lee v. Weisman involved a situation in which the principal—and that was the most directly relevant and a rather recent precedent at the time of the Black Horse Pike case.In Lee v. Weisman, the principal of a middle school, as I recall, decided that there would be an invocation at the middle school graduation, and selected a member of the clergy, a local rabbi, to deliver the prayer and specified the nature of the prayer that would be appropriate for the circumstances. And the Supreme Court held that that was a violation of the Establishment Clause.The case that we considered in the Black Horse Pike case involved a situation in which the high school left it up to the students through an election to decide whether there would be a prayer at the high school graduation and left it up to them to select the person who would conduct the prayer, the student who would lead them in the prayer, if that was—if they decided by a vote to do that.And so our job at that point was to decide whether this fell on one side or the other of a line that I referred to earlier which Justice O’Connor very helpfully—the distinction that she drew between government religious speech, which is not allowed, and private religious speech which is protected. The government itself cannot speak on religious matters, but the government also can’t discriminate against private religious speech. And we had here a situation—

That is correct, and the Supreme Court has recognized this in any number of cases. In the Rosenberger case and the Good News Club case and the Lamb’s Chapel case, they have drawn this distinction.So here we had a situation involving an election by the students to pick somebody to lead them in prayer, and which side of the line did it fall on? Well, it wasn’t individual student speech, but it was collective student speech by way of an election. And that was what we had to decide, which side of this line it fell on. And Judge Mansmann, who wrote the opinion that I joined in that case, explained why we thought it fell on the side of the line of individual student speech.

Well, that is why—that factor is why it was a case that didn’t—there could be debate about which side of this line it fell on. Now, I think there also was a disclaimer that was distributed at the time of the graduation explaining to anybody who was in attendance that the prayer was not endorsed—if there was a prayer, it wasn’t endorsed by the school board, and that this was a decision of the students.There are factors there that fall on one side of the line. There are factors there that point to the case being put on one side of that line, factors that point to putting the case on the other side of the line. And Judge Mansmann’s opinion explained why she thought, and I agree, that it would fall on the private student speech side of the line. But it was a question that was debatable.And then the Sante Fe case came along later. It didn’t involved exactly the same situation, but it involved a related situation, and that is now the Supreme Court’s expression of its opinion in the form of a precedent on the application to—the application of this test that I have been talking about, a situation like this.

That was—it was Judge Mansmann’s opinion, in which I joined, and I don’t remember the phrase ‘‘hostility to religion.’’ Obviously, it must be in there. I certainly don’t think that she meant to suggest that those who were objecting to this were proceeding in bad faith, or even that they were hostile to religion.I think what she—I can’t speak for her and I don’t recall the specific language, but looking at it now, the way I would put it was that she probably thought that this was not giving as much room for private religious speech as should be given.

Well, I actually think that the student note from the Yale Law Journal is an illustration of the sort of thing that has interested me and troubled me about the jurisprudence in this area for a long time.In the law school note, I talked about two—what are called the release time cases. It was the McCollum case and Zorach v. Clausen, both of which were decided just before Chief Justice Warren took his seat. And they involved situations that were quite similar. There was a distinction between the two programs, but they were quite similar and the Court reached contrary conclusions.And unfortunately this has been a repeating—a recurring pattern in the Establishment Clause jurisprudence, cases that turn on extremely fine distinctions. The Supreme Court held in Board of Education v. Allen, if I am remembering the correct case, at the end of the Warren Court that it was permissible for a school board to supply secular books to schools that are related to a religious— that are religiously oriented. And then later in another case—I think it was Wolman—they said but you can’t—but that doesn’t apply to other instructional material, other secular instructional material.And this has been the thing about the Establishment Clause that has bothered me, the absence of just what your initial question was pointing to, some sort of theory that draws distinctions that don’t turn on these very fine lines.

Well, I think the Court’s precedents have been very clear on that that the money—that a government body cannot supply money to a school for the purpose of conducting religious education. And I don’t recall any—I don’t recall a suggestion in dissenting opinions—maybe there is one that I am not recalling here that says that that would be permissible.

Well, Senator, I guess I would answer that by saying that you would have to—you would look at the factors that are relevant under the stare decisis analysis and ask the role of the sort of data that you have outlined, ask how that would be involved in the factors that go into the stare decisis analysis. And then if you get past that to the second step, of course, you would ask the same question whether—what bearing that information has on the resolution of the question at that step.Just speaking in general, not talking about abortion at all, in general, in deciding any legal issue, I think courts should be recep-tive to any information that has a bearing on the decisions that they are making. There is no such thing in general as bad knowledge, and I think that is relevant to the decisionmaking process that judges go through. They should be receptive to information that is relevant, that the parties want to bring to their attention, and then decide how it figures in the application of the legal standards that they are applying in the particular case.

Well, let me try to just explain my understanding of where the law rests on those two questions. The first is a question of tort law, or maybe it is a question of—well, it is a question of tort law, and decisions are made by State legislatures. Maybe in some instances it comes about through the development of common law through the State courts regarding the scope of State tort law and protection—a tort can be created that applies in the situation of the auto accident you mentioned or a legislature may choose to structure the tort law differently. But that has been a decision that has been left for the State legislatures to decide, and they have taken a variety of approaches in doing that, I believe.The second, of course, is the issue of Roe and the cases that follow after it, and those are based on an interpretation of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, and they are not the result of decisions—of legislative decisions made at the State level or at the Federal level.

Well, the answer is that the tort situation has been left for its development under State law, and States have taken a variety of approaches expressing the values that the legislature believes should be embodied in the tort law. And in the abortion context, of course, States have laws regulating abortion, and they’re free to enact whatever statutes they want on this subject as longas they comply with the Constitution. But we have decisions of the Supreme Court that establish constitutional requirements in the area. I think that’s the explanation. The decisions are made by different bodies.

Thank you, Senator. 

I agree that it is one of the most fundamental rights protected by our Constitution, that no one may be convicted of an offense unless they are proven to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and further than that, the Supreme Court’s decisions since 1976 dealing with the Eighth Amendment, have attempted to create a whole set of procedural safeguards to make sure that the death penalty is not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously, and thiswhole framework is designed to prevent exactly that, to prevent the conviction of an innocent person, and to prevent the imposition of capital punishment on someone who is innocent, or on someone who is guilty of the offense but it not deserving to have that penalty imposed on the person.

Well, Senator, it is unconstitutional to execute someone who has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Now, depending—

Well, that’s the ultimate tragedy that could possibly occur in our criminal justice system, and we should do everything we can to prevent that from ever occurring, and I have not had a case during my time on the court of appeals—I’ve had only a handful of capital punishment cases where there was a suggestion that that was a possibility.If the evidence develops at the last minute, then I think—and if this is a—it would depend to some degree on—the procedures would depend on—would be different depending on whether the person had been convicted in State court or in Federal court. The first procedural step in either instance would be to file a petition with the trial court. It would be—if it were in State court, it would be a State collateral relief petition, and those are handled differently depending on the State. And then a file of—I’m sorry. You could go to the State court or you could file a second habeas petition, attempt to file a second habeas petition in Federal court, and follow the procedures that are set out in habeas corpus statute.

The Constitution is designed to prevent that.

I had not heard of this rule until the hearings for Chief Justice Roberts, but it seems to me to be a very sensible procedure because I think we all want to avoid the tragedy of having an innocent person executed or having anyone executed whose constitutional rights have been violated.

Well, the Cruzan case proceeded assumed for the sake of argument, which is something that judges often do, that there is a constitutional right to say—that each of us has a con-stitutional right to say, ‘‘I don’t want medical treatment.’’ And the Cruzan decision recognized that this was a right that everybody had at common law. At common law, if someone is subjected to a medical procedure that the person doesn’t want, that’s a battery and it’s a tort, and the person can sue for it. It is illegal. The Court did not—

Well, that’s correct, and I think that our whole legal system is an outgrowth of English common law.

Most of our common law is an outgrowth of English common law, and I think it helps to understand that background often in analyzing issues that come up.

That’s a fundamental principle of common law, and Cruzan assumed for the sake of argument that that would be a fundamental constitutional right, but that is a right that people have had under our legal system for a long time, to make that decision for themselves.

Yes, Senator. That’s, I think, an extension of the traditional right that I was talking about that existed under common law, and it’s been developed by State legislatures, and in some instances by State courts, to deal with the living will situation and with advances in—which I think is in large measure a response to advances in medical technology which create new issues in this area.

I don’t think there’s any question about that. 

Could the subpoena—could this Committee issue a subpoena—

To have the defendant come and testify before the Committee? 

It’s not a question that I ever thought of. Sitting here I can’t think of an objection to it, but I would have to—I would have to hear whatever arguments there were to be made. 

Well, there’s a debate among scholars about the extent of the authority of Congress to structure the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and there are those who say that Congress has the authority to eliminate appellate jurisdiction by topic, and there are those who say that if—and they rely on the language of Article III. And there are those who say that to take away juris-diction over a category of cases such as that would be a violation of another constitutional provision, in that instance a violation perhaps of the Equal Protection Clause.And there is this debate that it has not—that it is not something—

Pardon me? 

I have not taken part in that, and I have read— 

Not at this time. [Laughter.] 

The case law is not definitive on this question. According to the scholars, Ex Parte McCardle is a case that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. 

Well, that’s also a provocative constitutional question. I can’t recall an instance where that has been done with respect to a constitutional decision. Perhaps it has been. I do recall back during the 1980s that it was done with respect to an issue of antitrust. And I would assume that if there wasn’t—well, obviously if there isn’t a constitutional question raised by that limitation on the expenditure of funds, and if you’re talking about a non-constitutional question, maybe there is no constitutional issue raised, there wouldn’t be an obstacle to Congress’s doing that. With respect to a constitutional question, that’s a provocative constitutional issue that—I don’t know the answer to it, and I cannot think of precedent on that point. I don’t believe there is any. 

Well, I’d have to know the facts of the case and hear the arguments on both sides of it. Unless there was a constitutional objection, then that falls within one of the most important powers of the Congress, the expenditure of funds Congress exercises. The Framers wanted Congress to have the control of the purse because Congress is the branch that is closest to the people. And I would think that—and Congress obviously has great latitude in this area.I don’t know what constitutional objections would be raised to doing that with respect to a nonconstitutional question, but I’d have to understand exactly what was—

Well, I would give the same answer to that that I gave to the more general question you asked a few minutes ago about taking away the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction over a topic of cases. It’s not a question that I have obviously had to deal with in my capacity as a judge or something that I have written about or studied in any sort of a focused way. My understanding of the writing on the question is that there’s a division of thought among leading constitutional scholars on the issue, and there are some who argue that Congress has plenary authority to define the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and there are others who argue that if Congress takes away the authority of the Supreme Court to hear a particular type of case, that there could be a violation of another constitutional provisions, and in that instance it would be the First Amendment. And as a matter of constitutional law, I don’t feel I can go further than that. I have—

I gave a speech a while ago addressing this question from a practical standpoint or touching on it from a practical standpoint, and I said that I thought that doing something like this would be an awkward and undesirable way of proceeding because it would lead to a lack of uniformity in decisions. If jurisdiction is taken away from the Supreme Court but jurisdiction remains in the courts of appeals, then conflicts in the circuit would develop— conflicts in the circuits would develop and you’d have conflicting decisions potentially in different parts—governing in different parts of the country and no way to resolve the issue. And if the jurisdiction was taken away from the Federal courts in general, then you would potentially have conflicting State court decisions. So the First Amendment, or whatever constitutional provision was at issue, would mean something different potentially in Vermont than it did in New Hampshire or in some other State.So there are undesirable practical consequences of proceeding in that way. I’m—

It would be, Senator. I have just not studied this issue in enough depth to be able to give an answer. I would have to study it in depth and probably hear it in the context of a case. What I do know is that there is a division of authority among leading constitutional scholars, and I would not want to hazard an answer to the question here without going into the question with a lot—studying the question in considerably greater depth than I have.

I don’t see a connection between the unitary Executive theory and that issue, and I think Congress has the authority to create a private cause of action for anyone that Congress chooses to create such a cause of action for, subject only to whatever limitations are imposed by the Constitution. But we often grapple with the issue of whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action for a particular class of plaintiffs. That’s a difficult issue that comes up with some frequency in Federal litigation. But where Congress speaks directly to the question and says that people with—and defined the category of cases, the category of plaintiffs who can bring a suit, a citizen suit, or whatever it is, then that’s definitive, of course, subject only to whatever limitations the Constitution imposes.

What I said in that speech was that the Congress— I’m sorry, the Constitution confers the Executive power on the President, and when we are dealing with something that is within the President’s Executive power, without getting into the scope of Executive power, and there I was focusing on the President’s duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. That’s explicitly set out in the Constitution, so there can’t be any debate about whether or not the President has that power.When we’re dealing with something that is within the scope of the President’s Executive power, the President should have the authority to control the executive branch, and the latest expression of the Supreme Court on that issue at the time was the Morrison decision, and the Morrison decision formulated the governing standard in what I would call functional terms. And it said that Congress has the ability to—has the authority to place restrictions on the President’s ability to remove inferior executive officers, provided that in doing so Congress does not take away the President’s authority to control the executive branch. And I was talking about the importance of maintaining the principle that the President is the head of the executive branch and should control the executive branch.

I said that it was inconsistent with what you could call the pure theory of the unitary Executive. But at the time, of course, Morrison had been decided, and it was a resounding 8–1 decision, and it is a very important precedent of the Court.

Well, if it comes up before me, if I am confirmed, then Morrison is a strong expression of the view of the Supreme Court on the question, and an 8–1 precedent on an issue that was important and controversial at the time when it came up before the Court, and it was very clear and, as I said, a resounding decision by the Supreme Court on the question.

Good morning, Senator. 

Yes. It was the leading case that was followed up by the Morrison case. 

I don’t think that it would, Senator. The administrative agencies—the term ‘‘administrative agencies’’ is a broad term and it includes the Federal Reserve—it includes agencies thatare not regarded as so-called independent agencies. It includes agencies that are within—that are squarely within the executive branch under anybody’s understanding of the term, agencies where they are headed by a Presidential appointee whose term of office is at the pleasure of the President, and that’s principally what I’m talking about there, the ability of the President to control the structure of the executive branch, not agencies—the term ‘‘administrative agencies’’ is not synonymous with agencies like the FTC, which was involved in the Humphrey’s Executor case, where the agency is headed by a commission and the commissioners are appointed by the President for a term of office and there are conditions placed on the removal of the commissioners.

Senator, as to the agencies that are headed by commissions, the members of which are appointed for terms, and there are limitations placed on removal, the precedents—the leading precedent is Humphrey’s Executor and that is reinforced, and I would say very dramatically reinforced, by the decision in Morrison, which did not involve such an agency. It involved an officer who was carrying out what I think everyone would agree is a core function of the executive branch, which is the enforcement of the law, taking care that the laws are faithfully executed, and yet—

But Senator Kennedy, what I have tried to say is that I regard this as a line of precedent that is very well developedand I have no quarrel with it and it culminates in Morrison, in which the Supreme Court said that even as to an inferior officer who is carrying out the core Executive function of taking care that the laws are faithfully executed, it is permissible for Congress to place restrictions on the ability of the President to remove such an officer, provided that in doing so, there is no interference with the President’s authority, and they found no interference with that authority there. That is an expression of the Supreme Court’s view on an issue where the claim for—where the claim that there should be no removal restrictions imposed is far stronger than it is with respect to an independent agency like the one involved in Humphrey’s Executor.

I said I would disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard Companies.

That’s correct. 

Yes, that’s correct. 

That’s correct. I don’t have the initial list that was submitted to the clerk’s office and I think I clarified in response to Senator Feingold’s question that that is a list for—that is a list that is used by the clerk’s office to make the first cut on recusal issues, but it is not by any means the last word. 

It grew, yes. 

Yes, I was. 

Yes. 

I don’t know what was on my—the list that was with the clerk’s office prior to the time when the system was computerized. I have seen recently, and I believe you have copies of the lists that were on the computer, and those lists do not include Vanguard. There is no question about that. 

I don’t, Senator. I don’t know whether—I have no comment on the list. That’s the list that they had and I don’t know exactly how that list came about, but that’s the list they have. 

As of 1/28/93, no changes. That’s correct. 

There are eight items listed. 

As I said, I don’t have a copy of lists that predate this. In fact, I didn’t have a copy of these lists and I don’t know, obviously, I can’t recall what was on the earlier lists. 

Yes. 

I notified the clerk’s office to take the U.S. Attorney’s Office off the list. I actually think I have a copy of the letter that I sent there. I don’t believe that I looked at the list and crossed it off the list. I sent them a letter and I outlined—I say, it has now been 4 years. This was an instance—another instance of my going beyond what I had to do. I recused myself from everything from the office, not just things that were there while I was in office. But after the passage of 4 years, I thought that the cases that I had had any possible connection with had washed out and so I sent a letter, and I have a copy of the letter, saying, take it off this list but notify the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the public defender’s offices that they should notify the clerk’s office if any casecomes up in which they have any reason to believe that any aspect of the case was in the U.S. Attorney’s Office while I was there.

Senator, if it was not on the initial list, then that would be an oversight on my part. I said in answering the question to the Senate, I don’t believe conflicts of interest are likely to arise. They really rarely do arise with respect to mutual funds. That’s one of the main reasons why judges and other people who have to worry about conflicts invest in mutual funds, and no Vanguard case came before me—no case involving Vanguard came before me for 12 years.

Senator, could I just say a brief comment on that? 

I have tried to be as forthcoming in explaining what happened here as I possibly could be, and I am one of those judges that you described who take recusals very, very seriously. And I served for 15-and-a-half years. I sat on the merits on well over 4,000 cases. In addition to that, let me just mention the statistics for a recent year, and I think these are typical of my entire period of service. During the last calendar year, I received over 500 petitions for rehearing; most of those are in cases I didn’t sit on initially; over 400 motions. Most of those are in cases I didn’t hear on the merits, and many of those are just as important as appeals on the merits because they involve things like whether someone is going to be removed to a country where the person claims that they will be subjected to persecution, or they are applications by habeas petitionersfor permission to proceed with—to take an appeal in a habeas case. And if we don’t issue the certificate of appealability, that is the end of the matter for that petitioner, who may be serving a very lengthy sentence or a life sentence.So we are talking about well over a thousand cases a year. Now—and this is over a course of 15 years. This Monga case is one case and I have said there was an oversight on my part in not focusing on my personal practice when the issue came before me. And when the recusal issue was brought to my attention, I did everything that I could to make sure that nobody could come away from this with the impression that Ms. Maharaj got anything other than an absolutely fair appeal.But I have tried to explain the whole thing. I have not given conflicting answers, but I have been asked a number of different questions and there are a number of steps that were involved in what took place. The fact that it was a pro se case doesn’t—I mentioned that not because pro se cases are any less important than any other category of cases. They are very important, but it is the fact that our court uses a different system for pro se cases. We don’t have these clearance sheets, and that is when I have typically focused on the issue of recusal.

No, I certainly did not. 

It is, Senator. I said in the—even if you read the answer as setting out a promise that would exist—that would be binding on me for the entire term of my judicial service, I did disqualify myself in the only Vanguard case that ever came before me.

Well, that is a question that I don’t think is settled by—the whole issue of the extent of the President’s authority to authorize the use of military force without congressional approval has been the subject of a lot of debate. The Constitution divides the powers relating to making war between the President and the Congress. It gives Congress the power to declare war, and obviously, that means something. It gives Congress the power of the purse, and obviously military operations can’t be carried out for any length of time without congressional appropriations. Congress is given the power to raise and support an army, to maintain a navy, to make the rules for governing the land and the naval forces. The President has the power of the Commander in Chief. I think there has been general agreement, and the Prize cases support the authority of the President to take military action on his own in the case of an emergency, when there is not time for Congress to react—

Well, the Prize cases, I think, go—are read to go as far as to say that in that limited circumstance, the President can act without congressional approval. A lot of scholars say that what is important as far as congressional approval is not the form, it is not whether it is a formal declaration of war or not, it is whether there is authorization in one form or another. The War Powers Resolution was obviously an expression of the view on the part of Congress—

I hope I am not giving you that impression, Senator—

And Senator, if I am confirmed and if this comes before me, or perhaps it could come before me on the court of appeals, the first issue would be the political question doctrine that I have described. But if we were to get beyond that, what I can tell you is that I don’t have—I have not studied these authorities and it is not my practice to just express an opinion on a constitutional question, including particularly one that is as momentous as this. I set out my understanding of what the Congress—what the Constitution does in allocating powers relating to war between the Executive and Congress and what some of the leading authorities have said on this question. But beyond that—and I haven’t read Professor Yoo’s book or anything that he has written on this issue—I would have to study the question.

We are required to follow decisions of the Supreme Court, to start out with, because it’s a superior court. We are— when we sit as a panel, it is our practice, and I think it’s the practice of all the courts of appeals, that one panel can’t overrule a decision of another panel, so it means that when we sit en banc, it is a doctrine that counsels adherence to prior precedent.

We can’t do that at the panel level. We can’t say a prior panel decision is incorrect.

Oh, when we sit en banc— 

That’s correct. 

Well, stare decisis certainly applies. Stare decisis takes different forms. There is what some people call horizontal stare decisis, which means a lower court has to follow the higher court—I am sorry, vertical stare decisis. And then are various forms of horizontal stare decisis, which means a court either must or should follow its own prior precedents. And on the Supreme Court, of course, when we are talking about whether the Supreme Court is going to follow a prior Supreme Court precedent, that is horizontal. There, it isn’t an absolute requirement to follow a prior precedent— 

It is not an absolute requirement, but it is the presumption that the Court will follow its prior precedents—

Well, I think people would question it if you disregarded the factors that go into the stare decisis analysis. If you said, I don’t believe in—you know, I am not absolutely required to follow prior Supreme Court precedent and I regard every question as a completely open question—

Different Justices and different judges have different views about stare decisis, but my view is that you need a special justification for overruling a prior precedent and that reliance and reaffirmation are among the factors that are important. But I have also said it is not an inexorable command. In the area of constitutional law, there has to be the ability to revisit a case like Plessy v. Ferguson. I don’t think anybody would want a system of stare decisis that made that impossible.

Different issues are presented in different factual situations—

Well, I think you need a specific issue in order to answer it. For example— 

I don’t know that there are—I don’t know whether there are statutory restrictions on the removal of the FDA Commissioner. 

And I don’t know any constitutional objection to that. 

I don’t know that he would have a constitutional objection to that. My understanding is that he would not have a constitutional objection to their doing that, but I could be mistaken, and I wouldn’t want to prejudge any constitutional question that might be presented to me. But I am not aware of a constitutional— if there isn’t any limitation on removal, then there obviously isn’t a removal issue there. As to the agencies where there are restrictions on the removal of commissioners who are appointed for a term, that issue was dealt with within Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener and in Morrison, and Morrison was eight-to-one and the other cases would be sort of a fortior from Morrison. 

I think that the courts were structured the way they are so that they would not decide their cases based on public opinion. If the Framers had wanted the Federal courts to follow public opinion, then they would have made Federal judges elected officials, as they are in—as State judges are in many States. They gave them lifetime tenure because they thought there was a critical difference between deciding cases under the Constitution and the laws and responding to public opinion.Now, they gave the courts limited authority because they wanted most of the decisions that affect people’s daily lives to be made by the branches of Government that are directly responsible to the people, so that the people can control their own destiny. The Framers’ theory was that sovereignty lay with the people and the Government was legitimate only insofar as it responded to the people. And that’s why Congress is structured the way it is; that’s why the Presidency is structured the way it is. But the courts were viewed—courts are not a democratic institution, and they were structured the way they are because they saw a difference between the judicial function and the other functions that are performed by the branches of the Federal Government.

Acts of Congress are presumptively constitutional, and I don’t think that’s just—that saying that is just words. I think that means something. Members of Congress take an oath to support the Constitution, and I think that the presumption of constitutionality means a lot. And I think that judgments that are reached by the legislative branch in the form of findings of fact, for example, are entitled to great respect because of the structure of our Government, the fact that the basic policy decisions are supposed to be made by the legislative branch and carried out by the executive branch, and also for the practical reason or the functional reason that Congress is in a better position to evaluate conditions in our country and conditions in our society and to make findings and to determine what’s appropriate to deal with the social and economic problems that we face.So I would certainly approach the question of determining whether an Act of Congress is constitutional with a heavy pre-sumption in favor of the constitutionality of what Congress has done.Now, ultimately Marbury v. Madison decided the question that when a case or controversy comes before the Supreme Court and the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is challenged, it is the duty of the Court to decide the question. Unless we were going to back to 1819, then that’s the practice that the Federal courts have to follow. But they should always do that with an appreciation of their limited role and the role that the legislature is supposed to play.

Well, those are issues that are decided by the Constitution. The Framers said that Federal judges have life tenure, so without amending the Constitution, I don’t think you could have judges serve for a term of years or impose an age limitation on Federal judges?

I’m not really sure. I understand the arguments in favor of doing both of those things, and State courts do that, and although I said yesterday I didn’t think we should look to foreign law in interpreting our Constitution, I don’t see a problem in looking to the practices of foreign countries in the way they organize their constitutional courts. And I believe that many of them do have term limitations on the length of service of a member of the highest court and other members of the judiciary. So there are arguments on both sides of the question. If you had a short term of years, you would have a judiciary that was like an elected judiciary, and you would have the advantages and the disadvantages of that kind of structure. But there are arguments on both sides of the question, and it is for other people to decide, not for a member of the judiciary. 

If I had been a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787—which is a little hard for me to imagine, but if I had been there, and knowing the way things work out, I guess I would narrow the range of possibilities down to—the range of options that I would consider down to either life tenure or a long term of years so that the judiciary would be insulated from being swayed by popular opinion during a particular periodas to the constitutional questions that come before them, and as between those I’m not sure which I would choose.If the judiciary is going to exercise the power of judicial review in enforcing constitutional rights, then I would think that one of those two options would be the best. But I wasn’t in Philadelphia in 1787, so I had no say on that question.

Well, what I can say is that it’s a precedent of the Court, and it built on the Midkiff decision which had been handed down a number of years earlier. I know that it touches some very sensitive nerves. When someone’s home is being taken away using the power of eminent domain, that is a blow to a lot of people. Even if they’re going to get compensated at fair market value for their home, the home often means more to people than just dollars and cents. It’s a place that often involves a lot of emotion. They have emotional attachments to it. They’ve lived in it a long time. They’re familiar with the neighborhood. They want to be with the neighbors. They want to stay in the same area. They may have emotional attachments to things in the home. So it is a tremendous blow, and I suppose that when—I would imagine that when someone’s home is being taken away, a modest home, for the purpose of building a very expensive commercial structure, that is particularly galling. But Kelo was a decision of the Court, and I’ve discussed my view about stare decisis, and should that issue come up again, then obviously the stare decisis factors would have to be, you know, considered as the first—the stare decisis question would have to be the first question addressed, and the factors that I’ve discussed would have to be weighed. 

Well, Senator, I don’t think I can answer that beyond what I have said. If the issue were to come before me if I’m confirmed, then I would first have to consider whether there’s any reason for not following Kelo, which is a precedent of the Supreme Court and grew out of the earlier precedent that I discussed, that I mentioned. Now, I’m not suggesting which way I would decide that question of stare decisis, but that is the way our legal system works, that decisions are presumptively to be followed, and I would have to address that question. And if I got beyond it, I would have to go through the whole judicial process that is set up so that questions of constitutional law and other questions are decided in the best way, and reading the briefs, listening to the arguments, partici-pating in the conference, and only that reaching a decision on the merits of it.

She certainly will be remembered for many reasons, and I think with great admiration by—I think she is held in great admiration by the American people at this time, and I think that when people look back, they will have great admiration for her work. She obviously was a pioneering figure and was an inspiration for many people who want to pursue legal careers, and other careers.She has been a very dedicated Justice and has been known for her meticulous devotion to the facts of the particular cases that come before her and her belief that each case needs to be decided on its complex facts, and that’s something that is an important part of our judicial process.I would try to emulate her dedication and her integrity, and her dedication to the case-by-case process of adjudication, which is what I think the Supreme Court and the other Federal courts should carry out. I think that’s one—that is a central feature of best traditions of our judicial system.

I think that anybody who is appointed to any judicial position has to be himself or herself, and I don’t think that anybody can try to replace the person, can duplicate the approach of the person that that person is replacing. We all have to proceed in accordance with our own abilities and our own outlook, so I don’t think that—I think we all have to be who we are. But I think we can emulate the great jurists of the past, which is not to say that we can equal them, but we can look at what they’ve done and see the things that they’ve done very well, try to approach what they’ve done in various areas. And I think that I certainly would try to emulate Justice O’Connor in the ways that I’ve described. I wouldn’t flatter myself to say that I could equal her in any of those ways, but I would certainly try to emulate the way in which she has gone about the conscientious and dedicated and dignified way in which she’s gone about the performance of her judicial duties.

I can only answer that really by saying what I think I’ve said before, which is that I’d be the same sort of Justice on the Supreme Court that I’ve been a judge—as I’ve been a judge on the court of appeals. I am my own person with whatever abilities I have and whatever limitations I have, and I think if anybody looks at my record on the court of appeals, they can get an idea about the way I approach the work of being a judge, and that is what I would try to do on the Supreme Court. And I don’t think I can do anything other than that, and that’s what I think I should do, and that’s what I would do if I am confirmed.

That happens to me all the time at home, Senator. [Laughter.] 

Good morning. 

The President, like everybody else, is bound by statutes that are enacted by Congress unless the statutes are unconstitutional, because the Constitution takes precedence over a statute. But in general, of course, the President and everybody else, is bound by a statute. There’s no question about that whatsoever. And the President is explicitly given the obligation, under Article II, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. So he is given the responsibility of making sure that the laws are carried out.

I think there are two questions. Maybe there are more than two questions, but there are at least two questions. The first question, to my mind, is a question of statutory interpretation, what is the scope of the authorization of the use of military force? I don’t know whether that will turn out to be an easy question or whether it will turn out to be a difficult question, but it is a question of statutory interpretation like any other. Of course, there’s a great deal at stake, and maybe a lot more at stake than is involved in a lot of issues of statutory interpretation. But if I were required to decide that, I would approach it in essentially the same way I approach any other question of statutory interpretation, what does the word of the law—what does the law say? Are there terms in there that carry a special meaning because of the subject matter that’s being dealt with? And I think legislative history can be appropriately consulted. And I would have to decide that in the context of the whole process of deciding legal questions, as I said, like any other issue of statutory interpretation.Once a decision was reached on the issue of statutory interpretation, it might be necessary to go further, depending on, I guess, the answer to that question.I would also say in connection with this that we have a little bit of guidance as to the interpretation of the authorization of the use of military force in the Hamdi case, where the Court interpreted that enactment, and determined that the detention of an individual who was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan fell within the scope of that, and they relied there, I think, on customary practices in the conduct of warfare in determining what fell within the scope of the authorization.

Well, as I said, I think the threshold question is interpreting the scope of that, and it might turn out to be an open and shut argument, it might turn out to be a very complicated argument. I wouldn’t presume to issue—to voice an opinion on the question here, in particular because I haven’t studied it in the depth that I would have to study it before reaching a judicial decision on the matter. Then depending on how that issue was resolved, it might be necessary to go on to the constitutional question, and I think you’ve exactly outlined where that would fall under Justice Jackson’s method of analyzing these questions. This would be in the category in which—well, if it was determined that there wasn’t statutory authorization, then—

Well, if it was determined that there was— 

If it was determined that there was statutory authorization, then I don’t know what the constitutional would— 

There would still potentially be—there might be a constitutional issue. Let me stop there. There would be a Fourth Amendment issue, obviously. If you went beyond—if you determined that there wasn’t statutory authorization, then as far as whether—then as far as the issue of Presidential power is concerned, you would be in Justice Jackson’s scheme in the category where the President—you would have to determine, if this is the argument that’s made, whether the President’s power, inherent powers, the powers given to the President under Article II, are sufficient, even taking away congressional authorization, the area where the President is asserting a power to do something in the face of explicit, an explicit congressional determination to the contrary. 

I think that’s close to the point that I was trying to make. The way Justice Jackson described it was that you have whatever Executive power the President has, minus what Congress has taken away by enacting the statute.

Well, I’m not suggesting how the determination would come out. I think it’s—that it is implicit in the way Justice Jackson outlined this that Presidential—well, he said it expressly— Presidential power is at its lowest in this situation, where the President is claiming the authority to do something that Congress has prohibited.

I do agree with that. I don’t think there is any question about that. 

I think that deference is owed to the expertise of administrative agencies. That is an important part of administrative law, and when you are dealing with an agency like the EPA, you would defer to their area of expertise. I think that is correct. 

I don’t think—I don’t see why it should not. It is the expert on environmental questions and where the APA—I am sorry, the EPA—for example, if the EPA issues regulations interpreting a statutory provision and it is given broad authority under the environmental laws frequently to implement choices that are reflected in the legislation, then I think that it is entitled to a broad measure of deference under the Chevron decision. If it issues rules, then any reasonable interpretation of the rules—I am sorry—of the statute is entitled to deference from the courts.

Both the Federal Government and the States have responsibilities in those areas. Historically, the primary responsibility with respect to that, to those concerns, has been with the States. But with the expansion of Federal regulatory programs, the Federal Government has taken on broader and broader responsibilities in those areas and now has very substantial responsibilities in all of those areas under regulatory schemes that have been in place for a long time and I don’t believe are being challenged on constitutional grounds at this time.If I could just say a word about that memo, which I read for the first time in 20 years recently, as I—it is a brief statement and as I read it, it is based—what it is primarily expressing is not an interpretation of the scope of the Federal Government’s—of Congress’s constitutional authority, but a recommendation based on the federalism policies of the Reagan administration.The Reagan administration had a policy of implementing its view of federalism concerns through policymaking decisions. In other words, its policy was to go further in respecting what it viewed as the Federalist system—as our Federal system of Government and the Constitution required to go further as a policy matter. And as I read that brief statement, that is what was being expressed there.

Well, as a judge, I would have no authority and certainly would not try to implement any policy ideas about federalism. Congress can implement policy ideas about federalism. The Garcia case, in fact, is based on the view that the primary— and this is what the Supreme Court said there, that the primary way in which the federalism concerns that were expressed in National League of Cities was to be implemented in the future was through policy decisions made by Congress.They said the States are represented in Congress through the membership in the Senate, and protection of the prerogatives of the States should be left to policy decisions made by Congress, or decisions made by Congress in implementing its view of how the system of federalism should work.And an Executive—a President can take a similar approach. A President can say although the Constitution allows the authority of the Federal Government to go this far, as a policy matter I don’t want to go along with legislation that goes up to the limits of what the Constitution allows; as a policy matter, I want to stop short of that. And as I read this memo, that is what we were saying there.

Senator, you are exactly right. If cases involving this area of constitutional law come before me, I will look to the precedents of the Supreme Court. And that is what I think I have been trying to emphasize, and there are governing precedents in this area. There is Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener, and most recently Morrison, which was an eight-to-one decision. 

I don’t think I would separate the constitutional questions into categories. I think it follows from the structure of our Constitution that the Constitution trumps the statute. That was the issue in Marbury v. Madison. It would be a rare instance in which it would be justifiable for the President or any member of the executive branch not to abide by a statute passed by Congress. It would be a very rare—

Well, I’m not sure what standing on its own means there. Somebody gave an example in a law review article I remember reading of a statute that said that a particular named individual was to be immediately taken into custody by Federal law enforcement agents and taken immediately to a certain place to be executed. Would the President be bound to, under his responsibility to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, would the President be legally obligated to do that, even though it flies in the face of some of the most fundamental guarantees in the Constitution, and I think we would all say in a situation like that, no, the Constitution trumps the statutory enactment.

Well, I don’t want to—I want to be very precise on this. What I have said, and I don’t think I can go further than to say this, is that that situation seems to be exactly what is—to fall exactly within that category that Justice Jackson outlined, where the President is claiming the authority to do something and the thing that he is claiming the authority to do is explicitly, has been explicitly disapproved by Congress. So his own taxonomy contemplates the possibility that says that there is this category and cases can fall in this category, and he seems to contemplate the possibility that that might be justified.But I don’t want to even say that there could be such a case. I don’t know. I would have to be presented with the facts of the particular case and consider it in the way I would consider any legal question. I don’t think I can go beyond that.

Well, Senator, this is a momentous constitutional issue and it is the kind of constitutional issue that generally is not resolved—well, let me say this, that it is often—it often comes up in a context that is not justiciable. But I think it would be irresponsible for me to say anything on the substance of the question here, and by not saying it, I don’t mean to suggest in any way how I would come out on the question. I don’t mean to suggest that there could be a case where it would be justified or not, particularly on an issue of this magnitude. I think anybody in my position can say no more than this is the framework that the Supreme Court precedents have provided for us, and when the issue comes up, if it comes up, if it comes before me, if it is justiciable, I will analyze it thoroughly, and that’s all I can say.

And I don’t want to suggest that it is or it’s not justiciable. We would look to the Baker v. Carr factors, and that is something else that would be very irresponsible for me to express an opinion on in this forum and I want to make it perfectly clear that I’m not doing that.

Well, the Fifth Amendment prohibits compelled self-incrimination and it’s long been established that evidence that is obtained through torture is inadmissible in our courts. That’s the governing principle.

In all the contexts that I’m familiar with, that would be the answer.

The person has—would first have to avail himself or herself of the procedures that Congress has specified for challenging convictions after they’ve become final. If this individual has been convicted and has gone through the whole process of direct appeal, either in the State system or in the Federal system, then there are procedures. States have procedures for collateral attacks and there are procedures under Federal statutes for collateral attacks on Federal convictions and on State convictions. The person would have to go through the procedures that are set out in the statute.The system is designed to prevent a person from being executed if the person is innocent, and actual innocence figures very importantly, even in these complex—in sometimes complex procedures that have to be followed in these collateral attacks. For example, usually, there’s this doctrine of procedural default, which is not something that ordinary people are familiar with, but it means that if a State prisoner is challenging a State conviction, the State prisoner has to take advantage of the procedures that are available under State law, and if the State prisoner doesn’t do that—

Well, then the person would have to, as I said, file a petition, and if it was an initial petition, it would fall into one category. If it was the second or a successive petition, it would fallinto another category and the person would have to satisfy the requirements that Congress has set out for filing a second or successive petition.

Well, I have to know the specific facts of the case and the way it works its way through the legal system. The rules here are complicated. A person has a right. It is one of the most fundamental rights that anybody has. It is a fundamental right and a fundamental objective of our judicial system that nobody is to be convicted without proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If evidence—if there’s evidence that the person is not guilty of the offense, then that gets to the very heart of what our whole system of criminal justice is designed to address.

Well, I can speak to the issue of diversity in education from a little bit of my own experience. A couple of years ago, I taught, as an adjunct law professor at Seton Hall Law School, I taught a seminar on civil liberties and terrorism, because in the wake of terrorist attacks on 9/11, it became apparent to me that there were going to be a lot of civil liberties issues raised. It seemed to me that these were issues of the utmost importance, so I put together a seminar on the question.The first time I conducted the class, we had an extremely—we had a class with people of extremely diverse backgrounds relating to this issue. There was a student who had been in the Special Forces in Bosnia. There was a student who was a Muslim from the Middle East. There were a number of students who had been personally affected by, in one way or another, by the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. There were students who felt very strongly about civil liberties. And having these people in the class with diverse backgrounds and outlooks on the issues that we were discussing made an enormous contribution to the class.So in that setting, I have personal experience about how valuable having people with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints can be, and the Supreme Court has expressed the view that diversity is a compelling interest. Having a diverse student body is a compelling interest. Justice Powell voiced that back in the Bakke case and it’sbeen reiterated in a number of cases and most prominently in— most recently in the Gruder case.

Well, I’ve spoken to my own personal experience about its importance in education and Gruder is a precedent that directly addressed this issue in the context of education. It’s the Supreme Court’s recent word on this issue.

It is a precedent and the Supreme Court has dealt with this over a period of time, and that’s the conclusion that they’ve drawn.

I would have to—I can’t think of a reason why Congress would not have that power, but I would have to be presented with the arguments.

Well, let me say what was at issue in the Saxe case because that’s the context in which I dealt with issues like this. The Saxe case involved a very broad antiharassment policy that had been adopted by a school district, and it prohibited the expression of—it not only prohibited the expression of political viewpoints, but it went so far as to say that just about anything that any student would say about another student that would be offensive to that student, including comments on the way the student dressed, or the things that they like to do, would be a violation of the antiharassment policy. And under the First Amendment, unlike in most other areas of the law, statutes can be challenged on overbreadth grounds, and that was the ground on which the statute was struck down in the Saxe case, that it was overly broad, that it prohibited a great deal of speech that was constitutionally protected.The Supreme Court decided back in the Tinker case that students don’t lose all of their First Amendment rights to freedom of expression when they enter the school grounds, and Justice Brennan’s opinion in that case set out the test that is to be applied there, the schools have greater ability to regulate student speech than Government has to regulate adult speech in general, but the authority of school officials to regulate political speech by students—in Tinker it was the wearing of an arm band to protest the war in Vietnam—is not unlimited, and there has to be a threat of disturbance on the school grounds or a violation of the constitutional rights of another student. And so any policy that regulated student expression, political expression in a school, would have to satisfy Justice Brennan’s Tinker standard.

That would fall within the South Dakota v. Dole standard, and the question would be whether the condition that’s attached to the receipt of the Federal funds is germane to the purpose of the funding, and that’s a standard that gives Congress a very broad authority.

Congress has the authority to attach all sorts of conditions to the receipt of Federal money. It has to be clear so that the States understand what they’re getting into, that if you take this money there are conditions that go with it, but provided that that clear statement requirement is satisfied and provided that the condition is germane to the purpose of the funding, then Congress can attach conditions, and it could do so in this area.

That’s not a question that I’ve given any thought to before this minute, Senator, so I don’t know that I could answer it, and I would want to answer any recusal question very carefully.

I’d certainly be happy to do that. 

I would have to understand the—I would have to see the ground for holding the wiretapping or the electronic surveillance constitutional before seeing whether it would apply in the case of other searches and seizures. 

I’d have to know what the arguments were made about it and on what ground it was found to be constitutional. 

It very well might not. I would have to know the constitutional ground for the decision relating to the wiretapping, and I have no idea what that would be. It might well not extend to things like physical searches of homes. 

There are differences, yes, there certainly are. 

Wiretapping is subject to—general criminal wiretapping is subject to all the rules that are set out in Title III, which are thought to be based in large part on Fourth Amendment requirements. And the warrant requirement is very strong in the area of electronic surveillance. When you’re talking about other types of searches, the searches can take place in a variety of places for a variety of reasons. 

There’s also a Fourth Amendment issue. Any search—

In both cases, and the Fourth Amendment could play out very differently in those two contexts. 

I have no reason to think I will not be. I certainly will. 

I don’t believe that I have. 

I certainly will, yes, Senator. 

I will apply the laws evenhandedly to everyone. 

I believe I have. 

Those were the claims. 

I believe they are, yes. 

Yes, it was. 

Well, Smith v. Horn was really not comparable to Pirolli for a very important reason. Smith v. Horn was a habeas case, and so what is involved there is not simply a dispute between private parties, and of course, disputes between private parties are very important, and individual rights can be involved.

There’s more to it than the Senator— 

Yes, Senator. As I was attempting to explain a couple minutes ago, there is an important principle called the Principle of Comity that is involved in habeas cases, and it goes to a critical part of our concept of federalism, and it is something that Congress itself has very strongly recognized in the habeas corpus statute. What I’m talking about there is the doctrine of procedural default, which is very closely related to the doctrine of exhaustion. They go hand in hand. And what Congress has said in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 is that on the issue of exhaustion, the court has to consider that even if the parties don’t raise it. 

Absolutely. The issue of exhaustion must be considered by the Federal habeas court, even if the State prosecutor does not raise the issue of exhaustion. And why did Congress say that? Congress said that because there’s something more involved here than a dispute between the State prosecutor and the habeas petitioner. There is respect for the Federal system of Government involved. There is respect for the State court system involved. 

The majority, but what I’m saying, Senator, is that the underlying principle of comity makes this case makes Smith v. Horn quite different from a dispute between private parties.And the Supreme Court has said that it is appropriate in certain circumstances for a court to consider procedural default sua sponte, and that’s what I thought we should do there. And my position on—

I don’t have a recollection of all of the facts— 

Well, I’d have to refresh my recollection about exactly what was involved in the case. There is— 

Senator, I’d have to refresh my recollection about Dillinger— 

Without refreshing my recollection, I wouldn’t be able to tell you— 

But what you read— 

Certainly, Senator, yes. 

I can’t think of a reason why that would not be the case. 

Well, I don’t want to express a view about the constitutionality of Senator Hatch’s bill. 

A constitutional amendment. 

No one but a natural-born citizen can be the President of the United States. 

There are legal—there are active legal disputes about the meaning of that provision at this time. 

And I know that there are proposals to do that. I know that it is an issue that is in play. If it were to come before me, then I would have to go through the whole judicial process of decisionmaking—

Well, Senator, on issues that can come before me in litigation, I need to apply the same standard that previous nominees have applied, and that is no hints and no previews. And they may be—they may turn out to be easy issues. They may turn out to be hard issues. But I can’t opine on them here off the cuff. I would have to go through the process of—

Well, Senator, I don’t want to say anything that— could I answer the question, Senator. I don’t want to say anything that anybody will characterize as an argument that I am making on one side of this question or on the other side of the question. I know that an argument is being made by people who favor this kind of legislation based on the language, under the jurisdiction of the United States, and I don’t know whether that will turn out to— I don’t know whether it will come before me. I don’t know whether, when it’s analyzed, it will turn out to be a compelling argument or a frivolous argument or something in between and I wouldn’t express an opinion on it.

Senator, my answer is that it is inappropriate for a sitting judge or for a nominee to a judicial position to offer opinions on constitutional questions that are percolating at that time and may well come before that judge or that nominee. It may turn out to be a very simple question. It may turn out to be a complicated question. Without studying the question, I don’t know and I wouldn’t—and even if I had an initial impression, I wouldn’t voice it here. I would have to go through the whole judicial decisionmaking process before reaching a conclusion that I would be willing to express.

I think our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause has evolved as the commercial activity of the country has developed. Commerce in the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution was entirely different from commerce in the United States today.

As a matter of looking at the development of case law, certainly the case law has developed. The pre-New Deal case law was fundamentally different from the post-New Deal case law, with which I don’t have any quarrel.

Well, the second view is contrary to Supreme Court precedent. It is contrary to even Lopez and Morrison, which says that Congress may regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.

Well, Senator, I don’t recall making a promise that I would reach a definitive conclusion—

And I have thought about it, but what I can say is that I certainly would have thought about Rybar differently had I had Raich available at that time. My effort in Rybar was to follow Supreme Court precedent. At the time, Lopez was the latest expression of the Supreme Court’s view of this question, and if the chronology had been different and I had the benefit of Raich, I would have taken that into account.

Well, it certainly would have changed my thinking and my analysis. I would have had to take it into account.

Well, I think your mentioning those two things, the memo that I wrote when I was in OLC or that I signed when I was in OLC and my service as U.S. Attorney brings out an important point. I was playing different roles. I had different responsibilities in those two jobs. When I was in OLC, I think what I was expressing in that memo was the federalism policies of the Reagan administration, which as I mentioned earlier, involved going beyond simply insisting on compliance with constitutional standards. It also involved implementing a policy that certain things should be done at the State and local level, even if the Federal Government could do that.As U.S. Attorney, it was my job to use the legal resources that were available to address the crime problems of the district for which I was U.S. Attorney and I approached that on a basis of cooperating with State and local law enforcement and my approach was that we should do, the Federal prosecutors should do and the Federal investigative agencies should do the things that they were best suited to do and that it should be a practical division of responsibility. And in many instances as U.S. Attorney, we were using far-reaching Federal powers. We brought a Hobbs Act prosecution and were stunned when the district court initially threw it out on Commerce Clause grounds, because that was virtually unheard of.

Absolutely, and I— 

Senator, that is fine. 

I will take the Fifth Amendment on the second part of the question— [Laughter.] Judge ALITO.—but it structured our arguments, so instead of arguing about things at home, we would argue about the issues that we were debating. My wife insists that we actually argued a debate in front of her class. We didn’t know each other at all at the time and didn’t meet, actually, for many, many years later, but we did have a debate at her high school, which was about 20 miles away, and she insists she remembers seeing us debating in front of her French class. 

Well, that would certainly be very helpful. These are very—these are momentous issues and they’re difficult issues and they are—they have just come to the surface in the last few weeks and I couldn’t begin to say how I would decide any of these issues without going through the whole judicial decisionmaking process. I think it would be the height of irresponsibility for me to try to do that.

Yes, you have to know the specifics of the situation. 

It certainly is. The issue of the ability of Congress to take away the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction over a particular subject of cases is not something that I have previously addressed in writings, unlike a lot of previous nominees who had addressed that, and therefore I think felt that they were freer to discuss that when they came before the Committee. That is not something that I have ever addressed in any writing, nor is it something that I have studied, other than to read a few— you know, read some of the authorities who have addressed the question. I did mention that I had given a speech expressing the idea that I thought that it was not a good policy idea. I could understand the—I understand the motivation, but I don’t think that it is good as a matter of policy to proceed in that fashion. And I don’t know what the argument would be as I sit here in favor of taking away jurisdiction over an entire class of cases. That would raise some serious constitutional questions. 

That is all I see in it. [Laughter.] 

I think they do. That doesn’t say that they can’t be structured in ways that differ from each other, depending on their function. And that doesn’t address the separate issues of appointment or removal or whether—well, let me just leave it there, with appointment and removal. But I think that the Constitution sets up three branches and everything has to be within one of those branches. 

They do look—yes, they do look like treaties between Federal law enforcement agencies and State law enforcement agencies. 

Yes, that is right, and the Federal criminal statutes that I am familiar with almost without exception have jurisdictional elements in them. That is the traditional way of casting them. There are a few areas where that is not feasible, such as drugs, but in most of the—most of the statutes have jurisdictional elements right in them. 

That is right. In firearms cases, that is just not a problem. 

No, it was not. 

No, I was not. 

Leveto, or I am not sure what the pronunciation is, yes. 

Yes, I do. 

Well, the Leveto case involved the issue of how long they could detain people who were present on the premises while they executed the search of the premises. And they detailed these people for a very long period. I don’t remember—

It might even have been longer. It was a very long period of time and there was no warrant for their arrest. There was no claim that there was a justification to seize them, other than the fact that they were present on the premises at the time when the search was being executed. The Doe v. Groody case involved the question of the interpretation of the warrant, and the standard that is to be applied there is, the Supreme Court has told us, a practical, common-sense instruction. It is not—the warrant is not to be interpreted like a sophisticated commercial instrument that is drafted by parties. The facts were—you mentioned many of them—that the affidavit prepared by the police officer said we have probable cause to search anybody who is found on the premises because we know that—we have probable cause to believe that this drug dealer will hide drugs on the people on the premises. And they presented that to the magistrate and the magistrate issued the warrant, attached the affidavit to the warrant and said the warrant is incorporated for—and I guess I left out the important fact that the officers—they said we have probable cause to search anybody on the premises and that is what we want; we want authorization to search anybody on the premises.And the magistrate granted the warrant and attached the affidavit to the warrant, and said the affidavit is incorporated for the purpose of probable cause, which meant that the magistrate found that there was probable cause to search anybody on the premises. But in the portion of the warrant where it said person to be searched, it only mentioned this—

The John Doe, and using—now if this were a bond, I think you would conclude the only person you can search is John Doe. But it is a warrant, and my view was that viewing this from a practical standpoint, when the magistrate says, yes, you are right, there is probable cause to search anybody on the premises, that is what he is saying. Those are the people he is saying can be searched. But even if one didn’t agree with that, you would go on to the qualified immunity question and say could a reasonable police officer who says I have got probable cause to search anybody who is on the premises and that is what I want, and you go to the magistrate and he magistrate says I agree with you on probable cause and here is your warrant—could they reasonably think that the magistrate is saying, yes, search anybody on the premises? 

I was concerned about the fact that a minor had been searched. And I mentioned that in my opinion and that is something that is very unfortunate. But the issue in the case was not whether there is some sort of rule that minors can’t be searched. That is not part of Fourth Amendment law, as I understand it, and there would be a very bad consequence if that were the rule because where would drug dealers hide their drugs? Minors would then become—they would become the repository of the drugs and the firearms. 

Well, the warrant here certainly could have been drafted better, and a lot of— 

It is, but we have to take into account that these are police officers operating under time pressure. And the Supreme Court has told us that we are not to read these warrants like they are complicated commercial documents. We are trying to get at the practicalities of the situation. 

Well, Senator, I think I have ruled in favor of asylum seekers in a number of cases now and—

Well, I know that I’ve ruled in favor of asylum seekers in quite a number of cases. I don’t have the list on the tip of my tongue. In the Dia case that you mentioned, the facts that you recited were not the facts that were found by the immigration judge. Those were the facts that the asylum seeker alleged, and the whole issue in the case was whether there was sufficient evidence to support the contrary finding of the immigration judge. I agree with Judge Posner that the way these cases are handled leaves an enormous amount to be desired. I have been troubled by this; my court has been troubled by this. But my situation as a court of appeals judge before whom these cases come is created by the legal framework that Congress has created. And Congress has given us a very limited role in reviewing factual findings by immigration judges. What Congress has said is that we have to accept factual findings by the immigration judge unless no reasonable fact finder could come to a contrary conclusion. And that’s a tough standard.And I have tried to adhere faithfully to that standard in all the cases that come before me, even if I felt that I might have reached a different conclusion on the record.

We do have to keep in mind just what’s at stake, and I do that. I know that a lot is at stake in these cases, and I read the record to see if there is support for the arguments that are made by these petitioners. But I have no way of supplementing the record. And there are serious problems. One of the most serious problems, I think, is that the witnesses, the asylum seekers generally testify in another language. Sometimes it’s a language that is not well represented in the population of the United States, so it may be difficult to get a translator. And the quality of the transcripts is often very poor, which makes it very difficult to understand what was going on before the immigration judge.Now, there have been cases where we’ve said the transcript here is so bad that we can’t make a decision on this, and we will send it back.But there’s the additional problem that the immigration judges are forced to make credibility determinations based on viewing someone who comes from a different culture, where mannerisms, gestures, facial expressions may mean something different than they do in our culture, and I’m aware of that. But these are bigger problems. These are problems for Congress to address. They’re not problems that I can address in the context of deciding these particular cases.
