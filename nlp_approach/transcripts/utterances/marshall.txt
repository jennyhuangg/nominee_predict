Don't wish to, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, but I am perfectly, willing to answer questions. 

I would say I am in general agreement with this one point, but I think I should make my position clear. I am-as worriedNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLas anybody about the mounting rate of crime, but I do not think it hasyet reached the point where it cannot be dealt with and dealt withaffirmatively.The CHAMMAN. How do you plan to deal with it ?Judge MARSHALL. I think there are quite a few ways, Mr. Chairman.No. 1, we have to work at the causes of these outbreaks of crime. No. 2, we have to build up our law enforcement machinery. Three, we have toimprove on our scientific educate the public.apAproachestocrime.Aboveall,wehavetoI remember, for example, the automobile thievery and all, which iscaused so much by people leaving keys in cars, and things like that.I don't have any single solution for it, but I think it is something thatdeserves the attention of every American in the country, regardless ofhis position.The CHAIRMAIN. Senator McClellan.

Endangers internal security. I would understandthat to mean that there was going to be a revolution or something; andI certainly don't see that. I just don't understand your question.Senator McCLELLAN. Well, I'll put it in other terms. Do you thinkit is reaching proportions where we will have a reign of lawlessnessand chaos?Judge MARSHALL. I would say that I have great faith in the -abilityof our country to meet any emergency, and I-

I think it is a great danger. I also think it is asufficient danger to require every arm of the Government to do every-thing that is constitutionally permissible to stop the increase, and in-deed to cut it down.Senator McCLPLLAN. And that includes the Supreme Court.Judge MARSHALL. No question about it.

My trouble there, Senator, is that I don't havethe facts that you have. I am just trying-Senator M6CELLAN. I would think you would have more than Ihave.Judge MARSHALL. Well, I am not in the prosecutorial side of theGovernment, so

But my particular job is not enforcement.

In the future, there is a possibility. But I have got faith in my Government. I know my Government will not lot ithap pen. 

No, sir. 

Yes, sir. 

I would not be commenting at all on the legislation that is pending in Congress.

Yes sir. Senator MfcCLEr.LLAN. . only ask you whether, in your judgment,and you are going to be in a position of passing on these things. This is not a given case, but this is for my information, to ascertain your judgment with respect to the matter of national security, where the crime could endanger national security. Do you believe the incidence of crime can reach the level whereit would endanger national security-using that term as used in the recommendations of this legislation.Judge MARSHIALL. Well, No. 1, I siid before that I don't have the facts that would lead me to say as to whether it has reached that stage or not. No. 2, if Congress makes a definite finding, then that findingNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLwould be given the weight that is entitled to be given to any other congressionaract of Congress. But whatever Congress or any other agency does to protect national security still must be done within the framework of the U.S. Constitution.

I say in answer, Senator, that I am as alarmed, I am sure, as you are. But I am equally alarmed that whatever is to be done by governmental agencies to meet this situation has to be done within the framework of the U.S. Constitution. That is my onlyposition. 

The question was so long, Senator, that Ithink I-AJrNOMINATION OF TH"URGOOD MARSHALL

No; I don't agree. 

Well, the majority rule controls the vote of the Supreme Court, as it does in every other court. 

I would say that that has happened, couldhappen. 

I think so. 

I don't understand the question, sir. 

I am not saying whether I disagree with it ornot, because I am going to be called to pass upon it. Tierel is no question about it, Senator. These cases are coming to the SupremeC.ourt.Senator McCrxmr,.\.. You say you do not; disagree or cannot make any comment on any decision that has been made in the past?Judge MasARSITALL. I would say that on decisions that are certain to be reexamined in, the Court, it would be improper for me to comment on them in advance.

No, Senator. I appreciate your difficulty, and I,-_have one, too.

I think that is a reasonable statement. But. you realize, Senator, Mr. Chairman, that was made at the University of Texas Law School. 

The University of Texas Law School. 

I was called down there to discuss these cases with them, and I was trying to give advice to these young students. 

That view was as 4he Solicitor General of the United States talking to law students, trying to give them the benefit of my advice, not as a nominee for this position, not as Solocitor General, but as a man who knew some law. Tlie CHAIRMAN. Well, the proof of it is that you did agree with the MiJruadngdeacMaKseARaSnHdALtLh.e EI sdeoonb'etdtohcinakse.that I have ever said I disagreedwith it. And as for the statement where I said it wasn't in disagreement among the people, the latest report of the Crime Commission does show that 65 percent of the people feel that the Miranda Ilo has not done any harn at all.bThe CYAIRMAN. But you stated you would rely on the brief. the reasoning in your brief, you rested on that, when after all, your position was different from what it was in the brief that you filed.NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL1.Judge MARShALL. I don't think it was different, sir. In the brief Ifiled, said that the FBI for years had always given that ruling, thewarning, and they had given ihe warning. And we will all agree thattheir performance has not been harmed by the giving of the warning.I said that in my brief, and that is just what I told them.

well, the answer to Senator Kennedy is that oncethe President announced the nomination, I have not made any state-ments to anybody about anything.[Laughter from audience.]

Senator, I think it is entirely different, becauseb1efore I went on the bench in the second circuit, I doubt that there wereany important opinions of the Supreme Court that I didn't commenton one way or the other. Once I became a judge of the court of,appeals,I did not comment. When I became Solicitor General, on occasions, re-stricted for the most part to law schools, I thought I had the right andthe duty to explain to law sclool students the answers to their ques-tions when they wanted to know what the Supreme Court!meant. ButI don't think it is proper, as a nominee for the Supreme Court, toexpress my opinion. That is my position.

I cannot-comment on what is coming up to theCourt,'

But'there arei hundreds of other ones on the waythat are variations of this. 

And as I say, I can't comment, because it is coming back up. 

Well, that is up to you, sir. But I have never been dishonest in my life. 

Well, Senator, fromr my experience on the second circuit, I know I have changed my mind about a case after I have reread the briefs, and then made my independent check. I have changed mv mind. But Once I put it on paper, that was it. 

I appreciate that. 

My answer would have to be the same. That is apart of the Mirandacase. 

I am very sorry, Senator. 

Thank you, sir. Senator FoNo. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, Thave no questions to ask. I just want to make a statement. Judge Marshall, I want to extend to you my warmest congratula-tions on your nominationto the position of Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I believe this to be a great and a historic nomination. It is my conviction, Judge Marshall, that you were dominated primarily because you have shiown that you are a distinguished and an-excellent lawyer and jurist. The fact that you are. a Negro. who has been in the forefront of many of the most significant efforts to secure our ideas of equality and brotherhood to all Americans rendersyour nomination of a special pride for all Americans. There is no question in my mind that you are eminently qualifiedfor ase'at on the high court; and to me~one of the manifestations of those high qualifications is the fact that. you had the very fine sense to-marry a charming young lady from my native State. I am sure that Cecilia Suyat Marshall has been a source of -great strength and in-spiration to you.NOMINATION OF THURGO'D MARSHALLThe name of Marshall is one of the most illustrious in the annalsof American constitutional law. From the time of Chief Justice JohnMarshall to the time of Thurgood Marshall, this Nation has madetremendous strides to make a reality the ringing words of equalityin our Declaration of Independence. I am convinced that upon con-firmation, another Mr. Justice Marshall will serve with great distinc-tion. I am delighted to strongly support your nomination, to wishyou godspeed, and to extend to you and your family my "Aloha"as you undertake your responsibilities.Judge MARSHALL. Thank you, sir.

Thank you, Senator.

I would not disagree with that as a statement, butit is based on the fact that the Constitution was to protect the peoplefrom what might happen temporarily in any governmental agency.

I think there is almost unanimous agreementon that.

In general, yes. 

Well, it is such a broad framework that I wouldsay yes,'but it is a very broad statement. 1

Well, back in the early decisions in the 1880's or so, it was said specifically that the Constitution was a living document to be interpreted and applied as of the time that a particular factual situation came up, that it was broad terms, written with a broad stroke, and was not intended to meet each individual problem as it came up, but to be the broad

I am certain of it, because the Constitution could not have foreseen what they obviously knew, that there would 'be changes in government. 

Certainly not. I agree with you, sir. 

I do. 

Congress has the sole authority to legislate in ourframework of government-sole.Senator ErnviN. Now, Blackstone, in effect, defines law as a rule ofaction prescribed by the supreme poweiin the State commanding whatis right and forbidding what is wrong. Of course, we do not have asupreme power in the United States in the sense that the BritishParliament is the supreme power in England. But would you not saythat a law is a rule of conduct prescribed by the lawmaking power ofthe government.?Judge MARSIALL. I would think so.Senator EiRViN. And it may take the form of a rule of conduct toguide or control the action of officials discharging public duties or theform of a rule of conduct to guide the actfons of citizens in general ?Judge MARSIITAm.. It would be restricted only by the authority of the UT.S. Constitution. That is fhe'only restriction I see to the power ofCongress to legislate, the only restriction, if it could be called arestriction.

No, Sir. I do not agree that it is limited to that. 

No, sir. 

I do not know. 

Since 1936. Since 1933, as a matter of fact. 

Four terms. 

I know there are some decisions that say a criminal case starts when a man is indicted and information has been filed. 

Yes; so I say I do not know. 

Yes; I think it can be interpreted differently.

Well, the first part is

It implies coercion or compulsion, the degree notto be determined.

Voluntary can follow compulsion.

Yes, sir. I tried a case in Oklahoma where theman voluntarilyly" confessed after he was beaten up for 6 days. He"Voluntarily" confessed.

But as to particular language of a particular see-tion that I know is going to come before the Court, I do have an opin-ion as of this time. But I think it would be wrong for me to give thatopinion at this time. When the case comes before the Court, that willbe the time.,I say with all due respect, Senator,, that is the only way it has beei/done liefore.NOMINATIObN'O' THtIRGOOD MARSHALL

Well, one way, you ctnh look 'at my opinions. 

My philosophy is that with this Constitution, the IT.S. Constitution, that with the oath I have taken in the past on at least three occasions, I will abide by that Constitution and apply it in the best manner that I possibly can. That is the best I can do, Senator. Senator EnwN. I am not asking you about cases you are going to have to decide. I am asking you about the meaning of what I conceive to be very plain words of the Constitution. Judge MARSHALL. Well Senator

It certainly would. 

Theoretically possible? 

des, sir; theoretically. 

I respectfully say it would be improper for me to comment on it. 

I do not. agree that that is my position. My position is, which in every hearing I have!gone over is the same,'that a person who is up for confirmation for Justice of the Supreme Court deems it inappropriate to comment on matters which will come before himas a Justice. 

Yes, sir. Senator EviN. And the questions I put to Justice Goldberg when lie wis before this committee? Judge MARSHALL. Yes, sir. 

I did not remember, sir, and I can, of course, be corrected, that they commented on any case that they knew was coin-ing before them. 

These cases are now pending in the Supreme Court or on their way.

Absolutely. But the State cases, I would not have to disqualify myself. 

Sixth Circuit, yes, sir. 

You have not asked me any questions about the Second Circuit. 

No, sir, I do not object to tliAt, u dess they are cases that will come before me later. But these are cases

I think substantially all but the last statementis in that opinion. I do not-believe the last statement is as you say. 

It was express; I think that was it. But we arenot talking about what I remember the decision said. 

I said, Senator, I respectfully say I am not going to comment or give any interpretation of that opinion. 1 just cannot do it.

So far as I can recall.

I think that was in the opinion. 

I think it speaks for itself. 

It is not-I would rather not comment on the opinion of the Supreme Court in the Miranda case in any form or fashion. 

I have to repeat, sir, I do not want to comment f'upon thait decision. 

I think its sole job is to interpret it as it is written or as it was written, either way you want to say it. That is the sole responsibility of the Supreme Court.

My answer, Senator, is that I would not want to comment on the merits of that opinion or the language. I do not think it would be proper.

I cannot comment, respectfully; I say I cannot p. comment on that opinion.

Yes. 

No, sir. 

My answer to that, Senator, would be the first case I remember was back in the 1930's that outlawed involuntary confessions, the case of Brown v. Mississippi.That was quite a while back. That was the first one, if I remember.

That is an arguable point. 

No, sir. I am saying iJf is the most obvious one.That isw'hy I mentioned it, because :Isay our point of disagreementamong lawyers and judges and justices is as to what is voluntary andwhat is not.Senator Eft~iWN. You joined in an opinion bY Judge Friendly against,the warden of Sing Sing Prison, in -which Judge Friendly said:Granting all this, it remains true that the chance of council's presence would have altered events is considerably less here than in the case of voluntary confessions, where a lawyer's advice can almost insure that none will be forthcoming.You evidently agree with that statement of Judge Friendly, because you concuirred in his opinion.If-0 A , d-W I"4 1NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLJudge MARSHALL. Judge Friendly is one of my favorite authors,and I agree with what he writes usually, without much exception.

I guess you would say, Senator, that the excep-proves the rule, but in another case, the opinion of which I wrote, thelawyer advised the client to confess.

I know of no case on that point.

I do not know of any instances of that being true. 

I say with all due respect, we have to leave habeascorpus. It was always available. 

I dd not remember, but in my time, they all had some form-not all. Florida did not get one until recently.

I do not know the reason for the passage of the Illinois law.

I do not know. 

As I remember, that is what Chief Judge Haynesworth said. 

To the contrary, Senator, I have limited mine so far to cases I am certain will come up or are already there. 

No, sir. 

I think so, Senator, and I think that has been theproblem every time a nominee has come before this committee. It is the same problem. There is nothing new about it. It is a problem.

I think I also agreed with you that prior to thattime, the States had uniformly taken care of it themselves in the State courts.

Good morning, Mr. Senator. 

I think that is correct. 

I think he went a little further, Senator. It was not that he thought so, but that his investigation up to that time cen-tered in on a particular person as a suspect. 

That is right. It was the Voting Rights. I thinkit was the 1965.

I think that is accurate. 

I think that is correct. Senator EnviN. Do not those two provisions of the Constitutionmake it plain that the State has the power to prescribe qualifications for voting for State and Federal offices, subject only to the limitation that they cannot deny or abridge the right to vote by reason of race or sex?Judge MARSHALL. Well, Senator, it is my,understanding that that was thoroughly debated in the Halls of Congress.

And Congress decided it was within their province to pass that bill. 

"Well, : would prefer to rely on the decision itself, but I think that that is a fair statement.

Well, I rely upon the opinion of the Supreme Court. That argument was made to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court rejected it.

I do not think the Court said exactly that. I am sure it did not.

Subject to the restrictions of the same Constitu-tion. Senator EnviN,. And do you not agree with me that under- the 17thaniendment, the States have the like power with resl)ect to electors of the Senators?Judge MARSHALL. Subject to the same Constitution. 

That is right. 

Yes.

That is right. 

I do not buy the word "guilty" necessarily. It saidthat they had violated it. 

It found that they (lidthat.,i" IYNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL

That is right. 

That is as I remember the act. 

I think that that is possible, but I do not see where that isSenator EnVIN. I am trying to find out your idea of due process of, law. Do you think the due process of law clause of the fifth amendment would permit the Congress to pass a law saying that persons other than persons subjected to criminal charges can have their rights vindicated in only one court of the United States?,TudgeMUiTsii,L. Is it. not true, Senator, that many governmental actions have to be brought in the District of Colunbia, 'regardless of where thelparticular matter occurred?Senator EiviN. Only so far as I know in respect to the questions of the situations where the Federal Government permits itself to besued or permits its officials to be sued. Judge MAI1SHAL,T,. But you do have to come to Washingtor,.Senator ErviN. If as the Supreme Court holds in South Carolinav. Katzenbach such an act as that constitutes or affords due process oflaw, then Congress has the power to provide that in all civil cases the only court that could have jurisdiction would be a Federal court sitting in the island of Guam, would it not?Judge MARSHIALLT. I do not agree. 

I would have to get the particular crime that isinvolved. I cannot answer that in an abstract proposition. I would say that normally if you go back to your common law, you are tried in thearea where you commit the crime. Senator ErvIN. Do you not think it is implicit in the guarantee ofdue process of law that litigation should be conducted whem the litigants have a fair opportunity to present their testimony and to bringthe witnesses? Judge "MARSHAL. I think that would be true. Senator EviN. Do you not think it isa handicap and an obstacle toState elections officials in Southern States to have to journ,-y anywhereNOMINATION 'OF'P T'URGOOD MAItSHIALLup to 1,000 miles and bring witnesses that. distance in order to establish their innocence of a congressional condemnation rather than a judicial condemnation?'Judge MARSIIALLr. The main problem is there is no problem of cost.The States can afford it. No. 2, with air travel today. 

In the Morgani case, as I remember it, the particular provision was based on the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and the Supreme Court held that Congress, under section 5 of the 14th amendment, had power to pass that particular section.

If it had come there without an act of Congress. Sen ator ERVIN. With or without an act of Congress. Judge MARSHALL. Well, Senator, that is my point of difference. If there is no act of Congress specifically interpreting the 14th amend-NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLmeant, then the court has the duty to interpret it.. But their limitation is greater against the Court doing it than it is against Congress, solelybecause of section 5. 

That was after extensive hearings, miles of rec-ord, and Congress came to that conclusion. The Supreme Court then had to look at that and determine as to whether or not Congress had that authority.Senator Errnv. Did not the State of New York raise the point, saying that under the Constitution it had the right to establish literacy in the Eiiglish language as a qualification for voting? Did the State of New York not say that in that case?Judge MARSuALL. Substantially correct.

I think it was the duty of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution as applied to the act of Congress, which was the one point, the only point that was before the Court.Senator EnvIx. Now, the Supreme Court did not pass on that question, did it, in the New York case, Katzenbaohv. Morgan?Judge MARSHALL. In Katzenbaoh v. Morgan, the only point before the Court was the constitutionality of section 4(e), as I remember.

I do not say they declined. I say they did consider the Lastercase in great detail.

That is right. That is the way I understand it. 

I do not agree, because the Supreme, Court finally passed upon the constitutionality of 4(e). The Supreme Court passed on it.NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALL

Refusing to pass on it and ignoring it is different. It hel(it was not in that case.Senator Ei1nN. The Court said it would not pass on that question because Congress had passed on it, did it not?Judge MAISHALL. Well, they said that Congress had passed on it and their job was to interpret whether Congress had constitutional authority to do so.

Subject to the final determination of constitutionality by the Supreme Court.

I would respectfully request that I not be re-quired to answer questions involving Miranda in the areas that will come before the Supreme Court in the immediate future.

I respectfully would rather not, Senator. 

I say respectfully that I would rather not give my opinion on your statement.

Thank you, sir. Senator ErvIN. I will a21d, however, that wtut I have said is in accord with the dissenting opinions of Justices Harlan, Stewart, Clark,and White.0 - 1,NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLJustice Hiarlan says this in his dissenting opinion, and it is as strongan indictment as anything I said:The decision of the Court represents poor constitutional law and entails harxi-ful consequences for the country at large.I would add that from the testimony given before the Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures by Federal and State judges, by prosecuting attorneys, and by law enforcement officers and from what appears in the press frequently, this statement of Justice Harlan that this decision entails harmful consequences for the country at large is certainly true. This is so because throughoutthe length and breadth of this country Federal and State courts, are compelled to free self-confessed murders, rapists, robbers, burglars, and other felons simply because the law enforcement officer havingthem in custody at the time they made their voluntary confessions did not repeat these warnings to them-warnings about things virtuallyall of them already know. I would like to ask you this question, Judge: As a result of your ex-perience in practicing law, what percentage of persons who commit murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries, and other serious offenses do not already know that they have a right to remain silent and do not already know that whatever the say derogatory to themselves will be used against them in court anddo not already know that they have the right of counsel at the time they are interrogated?Judge MARSHALL. I would say, Senator, that the percentage would give me great difficulty, but that the violent crimes, for the most part, are spur-of-the-moment crimes and the person perpetrating the crime does not consider Mirandaor anybody else. That runs from that scope to the calculating, so-called white-collar crimes. They are not worried about liranda,because they have a lawyer. So I say the figures wouldget me in great difficulty. I would also say that following the Miranvda case was the Johnsoncase of Now Jersey, which made certain that it was not retroactive. 

Senator, I took that position in a case on the second circuit. But I lost.

But I lost on that. 

I would have to rely on the opinion of the case in Anfela and Fahy. 

Senator, I would have to get the other name. Wilkins is the warden of the prison. There are several hundreds of those.

Hetenye, yes, sir. 

Well, I am bitterly opposed to a judge at any time using his own personal proclivities in deciding a lawsuit or writing an opinion. In that opinion, I relied completely on Mr. Justice Frankfurter's statement. I still think his statement is accurate.But it is not changing the meaning of the due process clause, it is applying the due process clause to the issue that is now before thecourt. 

I think that the meaning of the due process clause must change, because it is a one-sentence clause, and I imagine there must be a thousand interpretations of it.

I do not think the provision changes, it is what is the meaning.

Yes, that could be true. 

I do not agree on that. Congress is still here. 

If it is an interpretation of an act or an article of the Constitution, I would assume that that would be correct. 

But there have been cases where the Supreme Court, and I tell you I cannot at this moment name them, interpreted provisions and Congress changed that. There have been instances of that. 

I still say, Senator, that Congress has certain authorities that they can change and there have been cases where the Supreme Court has ruled and Congress in its next session has made clear that they have moved into the field. 

It is on constitutional grounds, but

That might be true. 

I wouldthink so. 

Senator, my basic disagreement is I do not be-lieve-I mean I am certain that the Supreme Court cannot change the wording of the Constitution.

But the Constitution gave the Supreme Court the duty to pass on the constitutionality of any act.

I would say the judge is not permitted to use hisown personal views under any circumstances but if the particular deci-sionmaker, whether he be judge or justice or magistrate, applies theConstitution to the facts and it comes out that way, that is inevitable.But there is nothing personal allowed, nothing personal.

It is personal to this extent, that once he appliesthe law to the facts and arrives at a conclusion, that is, you could say,his personal conclusion. But it should not be his personal idea that thisis good or this is bad just because I think so.

Senator, they are not necessarily new standards.The case you just talked about, I have been unable to find another line-up case before this one. This was the first case I know of where theissue of lineup was placed before any court that has a reported decisionon it. There might have been others but we could not find any.

The 14th amendment never changes its meaning,but if the fact is never presented in court-

The interpretation could change.

The point was these are sheer speculations. We do not know what a lawyer would do in those circumstances.NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MAISH:1ALL

In every word he wrote I joined it; in every wordhe wrote. My question would be, How would that have injured any-thing if they had appointed a lawyer and took him and she identifiedhim? What harm could that have lone to the enforcement of criminalprocess?Senntor ERVIf. I *ill tell you one thing. She could have died with-out having an opportunity of identifying him. That would have pre-vented his being tried for her murder.Judge MARSHALL. Well, she did not. 

I do not agree that the lawyer could have stoppedthe identification.

And the prosecutor could have told her, "Do notanswer."

Solely because the lawyer had not been appointedat the time of arraignment.

That is correct, I think.

You mean we said she (eouldnot testify?

That is a normal procedure in any habeas corpus case. We did not want to turn that man loose.

We granted a new trial because a part of her testimony was that she had identified him at the hospital room at a time when he was entitled to have counsel and did not in fact have counsel; that that testimony should not be used.

The testimony of the hospital identification. 

That should not be used. But if she could identify him on her own, I do not see a thing wrong with it. 

Because of the statement made by the prosecutor, as I remember it. 

That is right. '

Because we applied the law as we understood it to the facts and decided fliat. 

I think that is true. 

I repeat, Senator, the right of a lawer at arraignment was not established in Stovall. It was established long 'before Stovall.

Yes, sir. 

1965; about May, was it not? 

I repeat, Senator, we did not decide that. Wedecided that at arraignment, Stovall was entitled to a lawyer and he did not have a lawyer at that time.

It occurred immediately after the arraignment, which makes it worse in my mind. If they had taken him to, if they had taken him before the arraignment it would have been a different question. I do not know-

I would hope so. 

In the courtroom? 

I would say that is true, but all arraignments, Senator, do not fall in that category, because thereis a common discussion of arraignments where they put detectives in the lineup and they get picked out every once in a while. 

No,sir, it is not true. 

Well, one question I have, using the lineup, fhey do not have all criminals. They bring people in off the street.

I think that is correct. 

Yes- sir

I think that is correct; yes, sir. 

I think that the Supremeib Court Justices must bemore responsive to their oath than dny' Other judge because of that.

Yes they are free to do it. Senator MoCLFLLAN. If yOu feel they are fie, would you have anyhesitancy in overruling the Mirandadecision when it came-up for consideration if you became convinced that that decision was wrong?INOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLJudge MARSHALL. If I became convinced that, the Mirandadecision was wrong, I would, of course, vote my conscience, which would sayyes. Senator McCLELLAN. Then the previous court decision does not bindyoJuu, dagltehoMuAghRSiHt AisLtLh.eIltawbionfdtshethleanSdu?preme Court as well as it bindseverybody else in the lanqd. Senator McCLELLAN. That is an inconsistency, is it not? Is thatnot an inconsistency? I have to obey it because the Supreme Cout says so, but tomorrow, when you reconsider that decision, in your capacity you do not have to conform to it; you can overrule it and you can change the law of the land. Is that not so?Judge MARlSHALL. I think that is the job of the Supreme Court. 

No, sir. You did not let me finish. I think

But, Senator

Yes, sir. 

You would not need the Supreme Court any more. 

Sir? Senator McCLELTw. Except that it reverses itself you would notneed it?81-914-67-11NOMNATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLJudge MARSIALL. No, sir; I think the Constitution as a. living document needs somebody to interpret it.

Yes, sir. Senator McCrLLAN. Now you say you can change the interpreta-tion at will -.nd give it another interpretation. Judge MARSHtALL. Yes, sir; and that becomes the law of the land. 

I do not agree with your constantly referring to the Judges' personal views.

Yes, sir. 

I don't think any judicial officer should be

Yes, sir.The CHAIMAN. Volume 11, No. 5, dated May 15, 1966, gives some quotations from you at a speech which they said was made by you at the University of Miami on Law Day, 1966.Did you make a speech at the University of Miami on Law Day? Judge MARSHALL. Yes, sir; I made a speech in 1965. It was the University of Miami and the bar association, whole group together. 

The lawyers of the bar. Tie CH4, IwrMN. Now, you have stated that you have no objection to telling the committee about your judicial philosophy. I wish you would state your philosophy of the Ctonstitution of the United States and the general principles which will guide you in your interpretation thereof. Jlud,ge MARSTAL. Well I would make my every effort to read the Constitution of the UniteA States, to read it all, and to apply it to the facts as I get them with emphasis on applying the law to the facts without regard to any personal predilections one way or the other. The CIIAI MAN. And do you agree that you can't have any-that the Constitution of the United'States meant in the 19th century just what it means in the 20th century? .TudgA MATISITATT,. The words means the same; yes, sir. The CIAIRMAN. In deciding cases will you make a selection between constitutional principle base(l'on your own sense of right and wrong? Judge MARSHALL. Well, my own sense of right and wrong is the Constitution itself. 

Yes, sir. 

Not at all. I was brought up what I would sayway up South in Baltimore, Md. And I worked For white people all my life until I got in college. And from there most of my practice, of course, was in the South, and I don't know, with the possible exception of one person that I was against in the South, that I have any feeling about them.The CIIAII_[AN. Now, if you are approved, you will give people in that area of the country and the States in that area of the country the same fair and square treatment that you give people in other areas of the country?Judge MARSHALL. No question whatsoever.The CHArIMAN. Senator Thurmond? 

I do not. Senator TiTun3aoND. Of what legal significance is it that this amend-ment was copied from a prior legal provision? Judge MARSHALL. I don't know which prior legal provision you aretalking about, Senator.

Well, Senator,I might say frankly, I don't know of any case I had that involved the 13th amendment. My research on it would be very limited on the 13th amendment.

If such a question came before me, I would re-search the background of the 18th amendment, the language of the 13th amendment, and apply it to the facts. I haven't had an opportunity todo that. Senator TnR1n%0XoD. Do you agree with an article by Prof. AlfredAvins in the Cornell Law Quarterly of 1964 that the provision againstinvoluntary servitude in the 13th amendment prevents either Federal or State legislation which requires any person to render personal services to any other private person, whether the refusal to rendersuch services is motivated by racial or religious discrimination or for any other reason, and if you do not agree with this view, why do youNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLthink that the provision against involuntary servitude does not forbid legislation requiring personal services?Judge MARSHALL. I am not familiar with the article, and I am not at this time ready to give an opinion because I haven't researched it.

I don't know.

No, sir. 

I am not familiar with whether the facts are correct, and I have no opinion on it. Senator Tnvmowm. Do you believe that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was constitutional before the ratification of the 14th amendment? Judge MARSHALL. I am in the middle on that. I researched that when the school cases were up, and I consider it unimportant because the amendment was adopted and they were reenacted. But there was an argument made that-that your statement was true. It was made on the floor of the Congress. 

I think it was based on the 13th amendment, if I remember correctly. I could be wrong. That I don't remember. My last real digging on that was more than 10 years ago. 

It was argued. 

It was so argued on the floors of Congress. 

I don't know. I do know that the constitutionality of those bills had been litigated over and over again, and they have been found to be constitutional. And if I was called on again, I would do additional research and make up my mind and vote accordingly.

I don't understand the question.Senator TiUtmROND. What constitutional difficulties did Representative John Bingham of Ohio see, or what difficulties do you see, in congressional enforcement of the privileges and immunities clause of article IV, section 2, through the necessary and proper clause of article I, section 8?Judge MARSHALL. I don't see that any

The rights included in the pharse "civil rights" in 1866 meant the rights that were considered civil rights at that time. The delineation of them is not clear as of this day.

No, sir. 

Well, as I remember, the so-called Black Codes ranged from a newly freed Negro not being able to own property orNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLvote to a statute in my home State of Maryland which prevented these Negroes from flying kites.i'enator THRMOND. Is there anything else you wish to add?Judge MARSHALL. No, sir. 

I don't know, sir. Senator T1IUR-MOND. Why do you think the framers of the original version of the first section of the 14th amendment added the necessary and proper clause from article I, section 8, to the privileges and immunities clause of article IV, section 2?Judge MARSHALL. I don't know, sir. Senator TinURMOWD. What purpose did the framers have, in your estimation, in referring to the incident involving former Representative Samuel Hoar in c harleston, S.C., in December 1844, as showing the need for the enactment of the original version of the 14th amendment's first section?Judge MARSHALL. I don't know, sir. 

I don't have the slightest idea. Senator TiTURMOND. Why do you think the equal protection clause of the original draft of the first section of the 14th amendment required equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property only? Judge MARSHALL. I don't know. Senator T-umro-xD. Did you understand that question?Judge MARSHALL. Yes, sir. Senator TrTuLmiOND. What objections were made to the original draft of the first section of the 14th amendment in February 1866, which caused the framer to redraft it into its present form?Judge MARSHALL. I don't know. 

Offhand, I am not sure. There was debate on bothsides, and I am not certain. But I do remember considerable debateon it, but at this moment I don't remember.Senator TnmuImoD. What do you think the framer's purpose wasin including the privileges and immunities clause in tie 14thamendment?Judge MARSHALL. That point has been litigated, and I am not cer-tain yet what the answer is.Senator Tnmmio . What do you believe the privileges and im-munities of citizens of the United States are, which no State shallmake or enforce any law abridging?Judge MARSHrATL. That would vary as to the particular facts. Iwouldn't be able 'or capable of making any broad general guidelineson itI,would have to apply it as a particular case cameup."

Well, the first section said that any person bornor naturalized in the United States was a citizen of the United Statesand the State wherein he resides, so "person" and "citizen" becamepretty close. It said any person born-I mean I do not have this ver-batim, but it says any person born or naturalized in the United Statesis a citizen of the United States and the State wherein he resides,which was the flist place in the Constitution to give citizenship on aU.S. basis.

No, sir.Senator TnURMIOND. Do you think that the privileges and immunitiescase was meant by the framers to encompass greater rights, lesserrights, or different rights than the 'due process and equal protectionclauses, and which rights were intended to be embodied in each of theclauses which differs from the other?Judge MARSHALJ. i am unable to give an opinion as to an abstractquestion of that type.

I understand it; yes, sir.

I don't know any reason for that. It applies toeverybody in the United States.

That point recurs every term of every court in the country, and I don't know the metes and bounds of that either.

I am satisfied with my answer. 

Well, Senator; I would respectfully request that I not be asked to comment on broad general principles of law apparently or allegedly decided by the Supreme Court period. 

I appreciate that, Senator, and I respectfully request that you appreciate my position of not prejudging lawsuits before I am sent them. 

Y es, sir. 

I don't know, sir. 

Well, I think individually, not as a whole, but sections of the Bill of Rights have been taken into the 14th amendment to be applied to the States. And, of course, it would be under article-I mean section 1. 

I am not certain as of the present time just how much. But certainly, in recent years certain have been clearly applied to the States. 

I fail to see the relevance at all. 

If I may restrict my answer to the right to vote, the first section of the 14th amendment has been construed to prevent a State from setting up voting regulations which discriminate against any group of people. The broad right against discrimination is, of course, in the 15th amendment, but the equal protection clause has been recognized by Congress as protecting the individual against a State law which does not give equal protection in the State's voting qualification requirements. 

I don't think any of them were intended to protect political rights, because I am not certain as to what are political rights. I said if-you mean the right to vote, I can' answer that. But I don't know what political rights are.NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLSenator gressionalTIIURMNOvD. Globe, 35thOn February 11, Congress, second1859, as session,reported in the Conpage 985, Represen-tative John A. Bingham, of Ohio, said, and I quote:This Government men. There is not,rests upon and cannotthe absolute equality of natural rights amongst be, any equality in the enjoyment of political orconventional rights, because that is impossible. . . . No sane man ever seriouslyproposed political equality to all, for the reason that it is impossible.On April 11, 1862, Bingham added, and I quote:sAoufrfTefmhraneegnoertigoitnhrhtecttyhoiteivemznoe.ntteistAldertodeoesnptoonrtoottpceirhcnoitvtliedooclrnvetienountnnhdeaaetsrurirgcathhilt-teibztooelrnacnwsiticezdiveteienzprseeyhnnwisdphe.eonNrfteetiuhtihpenoeUrnanlaltrihteetehdtehreiSgSrthaitgattehtesot?ssf of the Union?Now, do you believe that these passages are relevant to interpreting the scope of the equal protection clause as originally understood and intended by the framers in regard to the right to vote ?Judge MARSHTALL. I agree that they are relevant, but not controlling. Senator TiIURMOND. In 1862, the laws of Ohio barred Negroes from voting, intermarrying with white persons, or attending school with white children. On April 11, 1862, Bingham was asked what rights Negroes had under Ohio law, and in particular, whether they could vote or engage in miscegenation. Bingham replied, and I quote:The laws of Ohio fully provide for the protection of the right of every citizen of the United States, whether black or white.Keeping in mind that Bingham was an experienced Ohio lawyer and legislator who had been at the bar for 20 years, and was talking about the statutes of his home State, do you find this remark relevant in interpreting the equal protection clause as it applies to the right to vote, enter desegregated schools, or engage in miscegenation?Judge MARShAL-L. i certainly agree that it's relevant, but certainly not controlling. All of this was litigated in the Brown case. Both sides, everybody, researched it. The Supreme Court found that there was nothing clearly derived from those debates.

I consider it relevant but by no means controlling. 

f don't know. I cannot at this time say what theSenator meant when he said "civil rights."

I consider it as relevant as being the statement of a chairman of a committee in voting out a bill, but not controlling.And if I might be specific, he says there is no right to serve on juries. It was a very few years later, when the Supreme Court said certainly that right was included just a few years later.

Well, I don't agree that at that time South CarolinSaewnaatsotrheTmleUadmetroNinDg.ivOinngJNaneugaroreys 1th4e, i1r8r6i7g,hRtse.presentative John A.Bingham, of Ohio, who drafted the privileges and immunities, dueproq , and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment, declared,and I quote:IIt is a guaranteed right of every State in this Union to regulate for Itself the elective franchise within its limits.NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLBingham also said that a clause of the bill admitting statehood, which ],rovided, and I quote, "there shall beNebraska no denialto ofthe elective franchise or of any other right on account of race or color,"was "in utter conflict with one of the provisions of the proposed constitutional amendment," referring to the second section of the new14th amendment. Now, do you findthisrelevantindeterminingwhetherCongresshasany power to determine the qualifications for voting in the States?Judge MARSHAALL. I don't consider that relevant as to the constitu-tional power of Congress. That is to be determined by a court.

No sir. Senator TnumloNm. 6 n January 27, 1869, Representative Bingham introduced the following proposed constitutional amendment, whichwas never enacted, and I quote:No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge or deny to any male citizen of the United States, of sound mind, and over twenty-one years of age, the equal exercise of the elective franchise in such State wherein he shall have actually resided for a period of one year next preceding such election.Now, do you find this relevant to a determination as to whether the 14th amendment was intended by its framer to give all citizens an equal vote at all elections?Judge MARSHALL. I consider that relevant with the restriction that it is no more relevant than other any other, legislation where provisions are proposed but not adopted.

I think it is relevant but certainly not controlling. 

I think that whether or not Congress has constitutional power to pass legislation is vested in the Constitution, and the body of authority to determine that is the U.S. Supreme Court.

I don't think it sheds any light at all, and the reason I don't think it sheds any light is because the very, not the same Congress, but Congress did do just that, and so I don't know which Congress I would rely upon.

The United States v. (lasszc said that you could not discriminate in the primary elections. It was strictly on the question of a primary election, as to whether that was actually an election in 7a,.wiic.

I would say I am in general agreement with that statement. 

Well, I would just say I am in general agreement.

I don't agree with that statement at all, because I know of no instance where the Supreme Court has done what you said.

I don't agree with the end of your statement that the Supreme CoUrt has a right to interpret the'Constitution any way they see fit at that moment. I don't agree with that. 

As set forth by its framers and I am not trying to get around the question. My point is that I take the position; which I think is contrary to what you' intend in your question, that this is a living Constitution, and its-you can't expect the Court to apply theNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLConstitution to facts in 1967 that weren't in existence when the Con-stitution was drafted. That I think is how it differs.Senator TnuvrtioiN. If the Court is bound by the intent of the fram-ers, in what sources would you look to ascertain that intent?Judge MARSHALL. The whole history of the adoption of the 14thamendment-I don't mean the 14th amendment-of the Constitutionand the Bill of Rights, the whole history.

I think you originally go to Congress, and fr6mthere you go to the several States.Senator TiHURM0OND. In what sources would you look to ascertainthe intent of Congress in proposing an amendment?Judge MAIRSHALL. To the Congressional Record.

I think they are very relevant, and they are duethe greatest of respect, but they are not controlling.

They are bound by the original intent, but theoriginal intent is not restricted to what one Senator or one Congress-man or one group, or one Congressman or Senator said in debate.

Certainly not.

I would agree with you if you would permit me to say that it is impossible for me to conceive of the Supreme Court ever doing that.

If they by any chance did it, you are correct. 

The only recourse would be a constitutional amendment, but I can't conceive of a Supreme Court, having taken an oath, to violate its oath and do that. 

Not that I know of. I have difficulty with the question because I can't conceive of that possibility. The question you propose requires that Justices of the Supreme Court violate their oath, and that I can't suppose. 

I stand by my answer. 

Again, I can't suppose that statement of facts. 

Well, I say, respectfully, Senator, I can't suppose it. I think that Government officials who take their oaths obey their oaths, and that goes for all Government officials. 

I am not familiar with the case. I am only familiar with the opinion. I did not read the record in that case.

Yes, sir. 

It was one of 150 this term, 150-odd, and I can't read the records of all of them. 

I don't know whether it is a new precedent. 

As I said before, the statements made by Mr. Stevens were statements made by a Member of Congress and they are not controlling on the Supreme Court or anybody else. They are madein debate, and I don't think they are controlling at all. I think you have to take all of the debate, all of the statements and draw fromNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLthat the intent of Congress at that particular time on that parictular piece of legislation.

Yes, sir. The CIAIRIAN. Did you write a dissenting opinion in the case ofPeople of New York v. dalamison,342 F. 2dJudge MARSrIALL. Yes, sir. The CAIIMAN (continuing). Page 255? Judge MARSHALL. Yes, sir. The CHAIR-MAN. In that opinion did you make the following state-ment found at page 279:First, peaceful protest, speech and petition, is a form of self-help not unknown during the era of Reconstruction when Section 1443 (2) was forged?Judge MARSHALL. I think so. I don't have the opinion before me, Mr. Chairman.The CHAmrMAN. Did you cite a book as authorityJudge MARSHALL. I don't remember the book. 

I think I did. The CHATRMAN. Well, now, of course, I don't want to leave the imression that you have ever been a Communist or anything like that, ut did you know that at the time you cited this work the author of that book, Herbert Aptheker, had been for many years an avowed Communist and was the leading Communist theoretician in the United States? Judge MAIRSrALL. I positively did not know that.

I certainly would notThe CIIAIMAN. Well, do you thinkJudge MARShALL (continuing). Have done it. The CITMRAN. Do you think it's proper to cite a book that's written by somebody as authority for any decision? Judge MARSHALL. I thin when you are in a decision and you are giving a historical background to it, you have a right to cite it, but Shoul not let thftt book influence your judicial opinion. It's sort of factual background that you need in considering it, but certainly I didn't rely on that book. 

I relied on the Suprqme Court's decisions, about six of them. Senator KnN DY. Mr. Chairman, could we ask what references were rhade in the Justice's opinion? Did he quote that? Did he have someNOMINATION OF -TUUrG0OD MARSHALLquotation out of it? Did he cite a certain observation? And, if so, what was the observation so at least we have some idea of what the reference is being, what is being made.

No, sir. Senator, the basis of that opinion was the New York law requiring the oatl of college professors. And the small question before me was as to whether or not a three-judge court should have been convened and I said it should have. And in requiring it I only had to decide the point that it was of sufficient constitutional importance to require a three-judge court. And in deciding it, I relied on about six Supreme Court cases which I thought were directly in point. And the case went back to a three-judge court, and the three-judge court denied the relief. And the Supreme Court reversed the court. So there was sufficient constitutional basis.The CHARMAN. Any further questions? Senator Eywr. I would like ask one I omitted. Judge MAMHALL. Yes, sir. 

No, sir; I don't.think we did. Senator E,'Vin. So far as you can tell, the Solicitor General's Office did not file a brief in this case?Judge MARSHALL. I don't think so; no, sir. Senator E vIm. I am concerned about the point the chairman raised' a while ago. I read so many opinions, for example2 the Chief Justice's opinion in Miranda,where virtually all of the opiniosi as far'as any questions of fact. are concerned consist of the reference to different books and articles and observations made by various writers who were not witnesses in the case when it was tried and who were not cross-examined at all. I have always had the feeling as a lawyer and as a judge that all decisions made by appellate courts ought to be based on the record which was made in the trial courts and that decisions should be made on thati; basis rather than upon observations in books and pamphlets and magazine articles written by men who were not witnesses at the trial and who were not subject to cross-examination by anybody.NOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLI came case wasto the basedconclusion that on observationsthe ofmajority opinion writers, who, soin the far asMiranda anybodyknows, had no special competency for writing about the things theywrote about.Judge MARSHALL. Well, to very carefully briefed, andthe contrary, Senator, there was--amici werethose cases were in there. Therewere ered issuethorough and full arguments. There the whole spectrum, I think, of the at all. But as of this morning, afterwere four cases, and we covlaw, so it wasn t just a side hearing from the chairman,Ithink I Senatorshould be very careful on that particular ERvN. Yes, sir. I was just struck whenpoint. I readthat.Judge MARSHALL. Sometimes you learn the hard way.

That was before I went on the Solicitor General'sstaff.

Thank you, Senator.

No, sir.

I don't know. That is my whole point, Senator. Senator McCLL'LAN. That is what we get to. I know we get criticized for trying to find out the philosophy of a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United States. But they are possessed, of and they ari exercising a power that is lethal in my judgment to the security of this Nation. And if we can't get some idea of the nomini2e's views with respect to the Constitution of the United States, theit .)w am I to exercise my judgment and meet my responsibility in passing upon the suitableness of that nominee? It has gotten to this point. If we can't find out some of the philosophy with respect to the Constitution,what will be constitutional and what will not be, in a matter as grave as the crime crisis in this country, I am in a quandary. What function can I perform if all I am going to do is just confirm the nominee because he is a nice fellow, or because he has training? I perform myfunction-if there is a clash of philosophies, one of which is dangerous to the country in my viewpoint, and the other makes the country safe, and I have got to choose between them, and I can't find out thephilosophy of the nominee, how am I going to function? It becomes that simple, and I am trying to elicit an answer so that Ican make a judgment.

The question, as I understand it, what type of legislation could Congress pass. 

I think it is possible, but I am not certain by any means. I cannot be certain until I see the law. 

I must havg misunderstood your question. I thjmght your question was, could a :statute -be drawn that would be cohistitutional.senatorr MCCLELLAN. Yes.Judge MARSIIALL. That is:speaking in the future. 

The statement, Senator, was qualified by, if thereis an unlawful trespass. 

That is what I said. That is the basis of it. 

On the same qualification, if it is by trespass. 

If it is a man's home or his private office, or any place that is his own as of today, it is my understanding that under the decision of the Supreme Court, that is a trespass. Senator McCr LLAn.Well, it may be, without any statute authorizing it. Judge MAR13HALL. Yes, as of today. Senator McCLELLAN. Without any statute authorizing it. But the question is, under those circumstances where there is a law authorizing it, if it is constitutional, would you call that trespassing, and wouldn't that be there under all circumstances? Judge MAIRSHALL. I can't comment on the law to be passed. 

No, sir, it doesn't. You asked my position, and that is my position. It was stated in the Hoff a case. 

I agree. S.en.a.t.orry-Ms-CtiCoLnsE?LLAN. Very well.

We have stated that in one of the latest cases in the.Supreme Court. And the Solicitor General filed a brief of amicus eurmiae in the case involving the use of evidence seized by special warrant. Senator Eiix. Does not the 'ecent decision excluding evidence obtained by an eavesdropping device hold that if the use of the eavesdropping device involves trespass upon the premises of the accused, the use of such evidence is unconstitutional; isn't that the effect of it? In other words, if officers search upon their own authority, or, rather, use an eavesdropping device upon their own authority, and their use of the eavesdropping device entails the trespass upon tile property of the individual, then the search is unreasonable under the fourth amendment, isn't it?NOMINAPION OF THURGOOD"MARSHALLJudge MARSHALL. Generally, that is correct. 

Senator, the Berger case held that the order signed by the judge was too broad. And that was the fundamental basis. That case said that the statute was too broad, but left open the opportunity of any State to pass a statute which would not have the effect of the New York statute, and an order that would not have the breadth of the New York order. Senator EnvIN. But is there any valid distinction between a search and seizure in which officers seize papers of the owner of a property under a search warrant based upon probable cause and the use of electronic devices to seize the conversation of the inhabitant of the house, if the use of an electronic device for that purpose is based upon tho warrant issued upon probable cause? Judge MARSHALL. I think that point was left open in the Berger case. I think there will have to be some further litigation and clarification on it. 

Yes, sir. 

I say at this time I don't know, because the Berer case left it open. And I am not too sure which way the Constitution calls on that. Senator E-viN. I can't see any difference in principle between seizing a tangible thing and seizing an intangible thing. Unreasonable searches and seizures of the person are forbidden, but reasonable searches and seizures of the person are allowed. And after all, a man's voice is nothing more than part of his person, like his hand. I have undertaken to quote a statement made by Chief Justice Stone when he was Associate Justice of the Supreme (0ourt.He was speaking of the failure of the Constitution to put any limitation upon himsefC and his associates on the Supreme Court. He said this:While unconstitutional exercise of power by the Executive and the Legislative Branches of the Government is subject to Judicial restraint, the only check upon our exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint.I think Chief Justice Stone made a statement of absolute truth when he said that. Although the Constitution provides that Congress and the States may change a decision of the Supreme Court by a constitutional amenlment, it is practically impossible to obtain a constitutional amendment because it takes two-thirds of the vote of each house of Congress, and three-fourths of the States to do so. And it is exceedingly Iifficult to get the necessary support to circumvent aNOMINATION OF THURGOOD MARSHALLSupreme Court decision. For some reason too strange for me to fathom, people who are very much inclined to condemn unwarranted exercise of constitutional power by the President or by the Congress seem to regard the exercise of such power by the Supreme Court as something rather sacrosanct.It is often said that the President of the United States is the most powerful public official in the world. I am inclined to question that statement. The President can be restrained by the Supreme Court, and he can be restrained in some ways bythe Congress. But I know of no power on earth that can restrain a Supreme Court Justice in an effective manner except his own self-restraint. A Supreme Court Justice who writes or concurs in opinions which add something to theConstitution which is not there, or subtracts something from tlhe Constitution which is there is not exercising the self-restraint which is necessary for the preservation of a constitutional government in America. That is what concerns me. What gives me concern is this: As a Member of the Senate I have a highly important responsibility. The American people have the right to be governed by the constant and certain principles of the Constitution, rather than by the inconstant and uncertain wills of Supreme Court Justices or any other public officials. And I have responsibility to do everything I can to see that the American people are not deprived of that right. And I intend to perform my duty in that regard, because I realize that Justice Sutherland stated a very tragic truth when he said, in essence, that the saddest epitaph for the loss of a right is that those who had the power failed to stretch forth a saving hand while there was yet time. I am deeply concerned about this matter. I want to be just to the nominee, and I want to be faithful to my trust to the Americanpeople as a U.S. Senator. I love the Constitution. I am absolutely convinced that the faithfulobservance of the principles of the Constitution by the President, by the Congress, and by the Supreme Court is essential to the preservation of constitutional government in America. Apart from the Constitution, our country and all the human beings in it are without any security against anarchy on the one hand and tyranny on the other. And that is the reason that I have made these inquiries at length.That is all. 

Yes, that is the way I understand it. 

Certainly. 

That is up to Congress. I think that the impeachment is left-

If they violate the Constitution. But I don't believe congress has the right to impeach any Judge if in the opinion of some Congressman they wrongly interpret the Constitution.

I have no position on that, because I can't conceive of a situation you are talking about. If you mean that a SupremeCourt Justice, or indeed the Supreme Court itself, interprets the Constitution differently from the way Congress wants it interpreted, thatCongress has a right to impeach, I don't believe that.
