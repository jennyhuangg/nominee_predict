NOMINATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., OF MARYLAND, TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2005
UNITED STATES SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 12:00 p.m., in room 325, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman SPECTER. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We begin these hearings on the confirmation of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States, with first the introduction by Judge Roberts of his beautiful family, and then a few administrative housekeeping details before we begin the opening statements, which will be 10 minutes in length by each Senator. At the conclusion of the opening statements, we will then turn to the introductions by Senator Lugar, Senator Warner, and Senator Bayh, and then the administration of the oath to Judge Roberts and to his opening statement. So, Judge Roberts, if you would at this time introduce your family, we would appreciate it. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very happy to have my mother and father here, Jack and Rosemary Roberts; my sisters Kathy Godbey, Peggy Roberts, and Barbara Burke; Barbara’s husband, Tim Burke, is also here; my uncle, Richard Podrasky; and representing the cousins, my cousin, Jean Podrasky. My wife, Jane, is right here front and center, with our daughter, Josephine, and our son, Jack. You will see she has a very tight grasp on Jack. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Roberts. Judge Roberts had expressed his appreciation to have the introductions early, said the maximum time of the children’s staying power was 5 minutes, and that is certainly understandable. Thank you for doing that, Judge Roberts. And now before beginning the opening statements, let me yield to my distinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for all the consultations. I think we have each other’s home phones on speed

dial, we have talked to each other so often. And I have every confidence the Chairman will conduct a fair and thorough hearing.
Less than a quarter of those of us currently serving in the Senate have exercised the Senate’s advice and consent responsibility in connection with a nomination to be Chief Justice of the United States. I think only 23 Senators have actually been involved in that. We are fortunate that a veteran of these proceedings is chairing this.
We are at a time of great stress in our Nation because of what has happened in New Orleans and throughout much of the Gulf Coast regions. I think the hearts and prayers of certainly my State of Vermont but all Americans are for those people, and I would hope that they understand that while we were having these hearings, they are first and foremost in our thoughts and prayers. I am sure they are with you, Judge.
This is the only time we are going to find out what he is, and so it is all the more important that we have a good hearing. Again, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate our meetings on this. I appreciate the meeting earlier this morning with you and Judge Roberts. I think that you have set exactly the perfect tone for a hearing of this nature.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. And now we will begin the opening statements, as I have said, of 10 minutes’ duration.
This hearing, Judge Roberts, is being held in the Senate Caucus Room, which has been the site of many historic hearings, going back to 1912 with the sinking of the Titanic; 1923, Teapot Dome; 1954, Army-McCarthy; 1973, Watergate; 1987, Iran-contra; and this chamber still reverberates with the testimony of Judge Bork in 1987, and it still reverberates with the testimony of Justice Clarence Thomas and Professor Anita Hill in 1991.
This is a very unique hearing—the first one in 11 years in the Senate for a Supreme Court Justice, and the first one in 19 years for a Chief Justice. And you would be, if confirmed, the 17th Chief Justice in the history of the country and the second youngest since Chief Justice Marshall was sworn in, in 1800.
Your prospective stewardship of the Court, which could last until the year 2040, or longer—the senior Justice now is Justice Stevens, who is 85, and projecting ahead 35 years, that would take us to the year 2040 and would present a very unique opportunity for a new Chief Justice to rebuild the image of the Court away from what many believe it has become, a super-legislature, and to bring consensus to the Court with the hallmark of the Court being 5–4 decisions—a 5–4 decision this year allowing Texas to display the Ten Commandments, and a 5–4 decision turning Kentucky down from displaying the Ten Commandments; a 5–4 decision 4 years ago striking down a section of the Americans With Disabilities Act; and last year, a 5–4 decision upholding the Americans With Disabilities Act on the same Congressional record.
Beyond your potential voice for change and consensus, your vote will be critical on many, many key issues, such as Congressional

power, Presidential authority, civil rights, including voting rights and affirmative action, defendants’ rights, prayer, many decisions for the future, and perhaps institutional changes in the Court, looking for the day when the Court may be televised.
This hearing comes at a time of turbulent partisanship in the United States Senate. Turbulent partisanship. Earlier this year, the Senate faced the possibility of a virtual meltdown, with filibusters on one side of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle the threat of the constitutional or nuclear confrontation. This Committee, with the leadership of Senator Leahy, has moved to a bipartisan approach. We had a prompt confirmation of the Attorney General. We reported out bills which have become legislation, after being stalled for many years, on bankruptcy reform and class action. We have confirmed contentious circuit court nominees. We have reported out unanimously the PATRIOT Act and, after very deliberate and complex hearings, reported out asbestos reform. So it has been quite a period for this Committee.
And now we face the biggest challenge of the year, perhaps the biggest challenge of the decade, in this confirmation proceeding. I have reserved my own judgment on your nomination until the hearings are concluded, and it is my firm view that there ought not to be a political tilt to the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice, thought to be Republican or Democratic. We all have a responsibility to ask probing questions to determine qualification beyond academic and professional standing.
These hearings, in my judgment, ought to be in substantive fact and in perception for all Americans, that all Americans can feel confident that the Committee and the full Senate has done its job.
There are no firmly established rules for questions and answers. I have expressed my personal view that it is not appropriate to ask a question about how the nominee would vote on a specific case, and I take that position because of the key importance of independence, that there ought not to be commitments or promises made by a nominee to secure confirmation. But Senators have the right to ask whatever questions they choose, and you, Judge Roberts, have the prerogative to answer the questions as you see fit or not to answer them as you see fit.
It has been my judgment, after participating in nine—this will be the tenth for me personally—that nominees answer about as many questions as they think they have to in order to be confirmed. It is a subtle minuet, and it will be always a matter of great interest as to how we proceed.
I do not intend to ask you whether you will overrule Roe v. Wade. I will ask you whether you think the Constitution has a right of privacy, and I will ask questions about precedents as they bear on Roe v. Wade. I am very much concerned about what I conceive to be an imbalance in the separation of powers between the Congress and the Court. I am concerned about what I bluntly say is the denigration by the Court of Congressional authority. When the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a portion of the legislation to protect women against violence, the Court did so because of our ‘‘method of reasoning.’’ And the dissent noted that that had carried the implication of judicial competence, and the inverse of that is Congressional incompetence. And after 25 years in this

body, on fact finding—and there was an extensive record made in the case, in the legislation to protect women against violence, the Court simply disregarded it.
And then the issue of States’ rights, the Supreme Court of the United States has elevated States’ rights, but in a context that it is impossible to figure out what the law is. The Americans With Disabilities Act had a very extensive record, but when the case came up in 2001, Garrett, a woman who had breast cancer, the Supreme Court said that the section of the Act was unconstitutional. Four years later, in Lane v. Tennessee, you had a paraplegic crawling up the steps access to a courtroom. The Court said that that was constitutional, again 5–4, on what really turned out to be inexplicable decisions.
You have a very extensive paper trail, and there will obviously be questions on that subject, and we will be concerned about what your views are today contrasted with what your views may have been in the past. Phyllis Schlafly, the president of the Eagles Forum, said that they were smart-alecky comments by a bachelor who did not have a whole lot of experience. So she is putting on an understandable gloss on that subject. But I know that will be a matter of considerable interest.
In one of your earlier memoranda, you came forward with an intriguing thought, one of many in those early memoranda, as your conceptualization power was evident, that Justices ought to be limited to a 15-year term. And with that idea in play, if time permits, it is something I would like to explore, voluntary action on the part of a Justice or perhaps the President could make that a condition.
Between now and the year 2040, or in the intervening years, technology will present many, many novel issues, and there, again, if time permits, I would like to explore that.
I am down to 10 seconds, and I intend to stop precisely on time, and this Committee has a record for maintaining that time. That is it.
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. I now yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy.
STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT
Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the way you have conducted the whole run-up to this hearing.
A few days ago, William Rehnquist passed away. He had 33 years of service on the Supreme Court. Last week, many of us paid our respects for his service at the monumental building across the street in which he devoted himself to protecting the independence of the Federal judiciary. I know, Judge Roberts, that was a particularly difficult time for you because of your close relationship with him. But I think of the facade of that Court with its marble from Vermont, and I think of how much our State served as a refuge for the Chief Justice, especially in the summer months.
Today, the devastation and despair facing millions of our fellow Americans in the Gulf region is a tragic reminder of why we have a Federal Government and why it is critical that our Government

be responsive. We need the Federal Government for our protection and security; to cast a lifeline to those in distress; to mobilize vital resources, beyond the ability of any State or local government, all for the common good.
The full dimensions of the disaster are not yet known. Bodies of loved ones need to be recovered, families need to be reunited, survivors need to be assisted. Long-term health risk and environmental damage have to be assessed.
But if anyone needed a reminder of the need for and role of the Government, the last few days have provided it. If anyone needed a reminder of the growing poverty and despair among too many Americans, we now have it. And if anyone needed a reminder of the racial divide that remains in our Nation, no one can now doubt that we still have miles to go.
I believe that the American people still want and expect and demand a Government that will help ensure justice and equal opportunity for all, and especially for those who, through no fault of their own, were born into poverty. The American people deserve a Government as good as they are with a heart as big as theirs are. We are all Americans, and all Americans should have an opportunity to earn a fair share of the bounty and blessings that America has to offer.
And, Judge, we have been given a great Constitution. As you know as well as anybody here, it begins, ‘‘We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.’’ It is a framework for our Government, the foundation of our rights and liberties.
In fact, Vermont joined the union the same year the Bill of Rights was ratified. Those of us from the Green Mountain State, the Nation’s 14th State, have historically been very protective of our fundamental rights and liberties. Many feel that we did not join the union until we were sure the Bill of Rights was going to go through. We understand the importance of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
In these hearings we are going to be discussing constitutional issues that may seem legalistic, but they are vital issues. They affect every one of us every day. When we discuss the Constitution’s Commerce Clause or Spending Power, for example, we are asking about Congressional authority to pass laws to ensure clean air and water and children’s and seniors’ health, safe food and drugs, safe work places, even wetland protection and levees that should protect our communities from natural disasters.
Our constitutional values remain constant. We want to realize the American promise of fairness and equality and justice. The Constitution says ‘‘We the People.’’ When the Constitution was written, though, ‘‘We the People’’ did not include Native Americans, or African-American slaves, but only free people. It took more than four score years and a civil war before the Constitution was amended to include all citizens, all persons born and naturalized in the United States. Even then half of the people did not have one of democracy’s defining rights: women were not yet guaranteed the right

to vote. That did not happen until 1920, and decades later still it took an historic constitutional ruling, a unanimous ruling by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Brown v. Board of Education, and then landmark legislation by the Federal Government for America to begin to provide a measure of equality to many who were held back for so long because, and only because, of the color of their skin.
I have long been a proponent of First Amendment freedoms and open Government because the public’s right to know what their Government is doing promotes accountability.
Federal Judges are not elected. They serve for life if they are confirmed. The people never have the opportunity for effective oversight of their work. Judiciary is the most isolated branch of our Government from public accountability. So this is the only opportunity to examine what kind of justice John Roberts will dispense if promoted to the Supreme Court, the direction he would lead the Federal Judiciary.
This hearing is the only chance that ‘‘We the People’’ have to hear from and reflect on the suitability of the nominee to be a final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution. Open and honest public conversation with a nominee in these hearing rooms is an important part of this process. This hearing is about the fundamental rights of all Americans, and you are the first nominee of the 21st century. If you are confirmed, you will serve not just for the remaining 3 years of the Bush administration, but you could serve through the administrations of the next seven or eight Presidents. Judge Roberts, you will be deciding matters that affect not only all Americans today but also our children and our grandchildren.
In one of these hearings nearly 20 years ago, I noted how critical it is for the Senate to engage in a public exploration of the judicial philosophy of Supreme Court nominees. I said: ‘‘There can hardly be an issue closer to the heart of the Senate’s role than a full and public exposition of the nominee’s approach to the Constitution and to the role of the courts in discerning and enforcing its commands. That is what I mean by judicial philosophy.’’ That truth has not changed.
What is more difficult to see, though, is the arc of the law in the years ahead, as Justices will vote on which cases to accept and then how to decide them. Ours is a Government of laws. When we are faced with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, we are reminded that it is our fellow citizens, 9 out of our 280 million Americans, who interpret and apply those laws. The balance and direction of the Supreme Court is now at issue with the two vacancies of Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. Chief among emerging concerns are whether the Supreme Court will continue its recent efforts to restrict the authority of Congress to pass legislation to protect the people’s interest in the environment and safety, and in civil rights, and whether the Supreme Court will effectively check the greatly enhanced Presidential power that has been amassed in the last few years.
In other words, Judge Roberts, the issue is whether you would be the protector of the rights of all Americans, not just Republicans, not just Democrats, not just Independents, but all Ameri-

cans, whether you can serve as the check and balance that all Americans expect.
The light of the nominations process is intense. It is intense because it is the only time that light is going to shine. The afterglow lasts for the rest of a Justice’s career. ‘‘We the People’’ have just this one chance to inquire whether this person should be entrusted with the privilege and responsibility of interpreting our Constitution, and dispensing justice from the Nation’s highest court. Two hundred eighty million Americans. The President stated his choice. Now there are only 100 Americans standing in the shoes of all other Americans, and on behalf of the American people, it is the job of the 100 of us in the Senate to do all we can to make sure we get it right.
Mr. Chairman, there is time left over, but I have said all I intend to say.
[The prepared statement of Senator Leahy appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy for your statement. Thank you for your leadership, and your leadership on observing the time so meticulously.
Senator Hatch.
STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH
Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by saying that my thoughts and prayers are with the family of Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He concluded his life on Earth just the way he lived it, independently and with dignity. I am glad that his family was with him when he passed away. He was a good man and a great Judge. Judge Roberts, I know that you and Chief Justice Rehnquist remained close friends. He would have been proud to have a former clerk serve with him as a colleague on the Court, and now you have been nominated to succeed him as Chief Justice. When President Bush nominated you 2 years ago to your current post on the U.S. Court of Appeals, you had two hearings before this Committee, and additionally answered approximately 100 written questions from various Senators. The American Bar Association twice unanimously gave you its highest ‘‘well-qualified’’ rating. That process covered a lot of ground, including many of the same issues which are sure to be raised here. You acquitted yourself so well that the Senate confirmed you without dissent. Do not be surprised now, however, if it seems like none of that scrutiny and evaluation had ever happened. Let me mention one example relating to my home State of Utah to show how the confirmation process has changed. President Warren G. Harding nominated former Utah Senator George Sutherland to the Supreme Court on September 5th, 1922. That same day the Judiciary Committee Chairman went straight to the Senate floor, and after a few remarks, made a motion to confirm the nomination. The Senate promptly and unanimously agreed. There was no inquisition, no fishing expedition, no scurrilous and false attack ads. The judicial selection process, of course, has changed because what

some political forces want judges to do is change from what America’s founders established.
America’s founders believed that separating the branches of Government with the Legislature making the law and the Judiciary interpreting and applying the law is the linchpin of limited Government and liberty. James Madison said that no political truth has greater intrinsic value. Quoting the philosopher Montesquieu, Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist No. 78 that, ‘‘There is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the Legislative and Executive powers.’’
Well, times have changed. Today some see the separation of powers not as a condition for liberty, but as an obstacle to their own political agenda. When they lose in the legislature they want the Judiciary to give them another bite at the political apple. Politicizing the Judiciary leads to politicizing judicial selection.
The confirmation process has sometimes been, it seems to me, unbecoming of the Senate and disrespectful of nominees. I applaud President Bush for resisting this trend and for nominating qualified men and women who as judges will not legislate from the bench, and you are a perfect example of that.
The conviction that judges interpret and apply but do not make the law, helps us sort out the information we need, the questions we ask, the standards we apply, and the decisions we make. With that in mind, I believe that there are three facts that should guide us in this hearing.
First, what judges do limits what judicial nominees may discuss. Judges must be impartial and independent. Their very oath of office requires impartiality and the canons of judicial ethics prohibit judges and judicial nominees from making commitments regarding issues that may come before them. I will be the first to admit that Senators want answers to a great many questions, but I also have to admit that a Senator’s desire to know something is not the only consideration on the table. Some of have said that nominees who do not spill their guts about whatever a Senator wants to know are hiding something from the American people. Some compare a nominee’s refusal to violate his judicial oath or abandon judicial ethics to taking the Fifth Amendment.
These might be catchy sound bites, but they are patently false. That notion misleads the American people about what judges do and slanders good and honorable nominees who want to be both responsive to Senators and protect their impartiality and independence.
Nominees may not be able to answer questions that seek hints, forecasts or previews about how they would rule on particular issues. Some Senators consult with law professors to ask these questions a dozen different ways, but we all know that is what they seek.
In 1993, President Clinton’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, explained better than I can why nominees cannot answer such questions no matter how they are framed. She said, ‘‘A judge sworn to decided impartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not only disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would display disdain for the entire judicial process.’’

Nominees may not be able to answer questions asking them to opine or speculate about hypotheticals outside of an actual case with concrete issues and real facts. Since 1792, as long as the Judiciary itself has existed, the Supreme Court has held that judges do not have the authority to render such advisory opinions. We should not be surprised then when nominees decline to provide what judges themselves may not provide. So the first fact that should guide us here is that, no matter how badly Senators want to know things, judicial nominees are limited in what they may discuss. That limitation is real, and it comes from the very nature of what judges do.
The second fact is that nominees themselves must determine where to draw the line. Judges, not Senators, take the oath of judicial office. Judges, not Senators, are bound by the canons of judicial ethics. Judge Roberts will be a Federal judge for many years to come. This process will only determine which courtroom he will occupy. He must determine how best to honor his judicial obligations. Different nominees may draw this line a little differently, but they draw the same kind of line protecting their judicial impartiality and independence.
Justice Stephen Breyer drew that line in 1994. As he put it, clients and lawyers must understand that judges are really openminded. Justice Anthony Kennedy drew that line in 1987. He said that the public expects that a judge will be confirmed because of his temperament and character, not his position on the issues.
Recently one of our colleagues on this Committee dismissed as a myth the idea that Justice Ginsburg refused to discuss things related to how she would rule. Anyone watching C–SPAN’s recent replays of Justice Ginsburg knows that this is not a myth, it is a reality.
I was on this Committee in 1993. Justice Ginsburg was not telling mythological tales when she refused nearly 60 times to answer questions, including mine, that she believed would violate what she said was her rule of ‘‘no hints, no forecasts, no previews.’’ Those were her words, not mine. Justice Ginsburg did what every Supreme Court nominee has done, she drew the line she believed was necessary to protect her impartiality and independence.
Finally, the third fact that should guide us is that the Senate traditionally has respected the nominee’s judgment about where to draw the line. In response to some of my questions, Justice Ginsburg said, ‘‘I must draw the line at that point and hope you will respect what I have tried to tell you.’’ Did I wish she had drawn the line differently? Of course. But I respected her decision. This is the historical standard.
In 1967, our colleague, Senator Kennedy, a former Chairman of this Committee, made the same point at a press conference supporting the Supreme Court nomination of Thurgood Marshall. Senator Kennedy said, ‘‘We have to respect that any nominee to the Supreme Court would have to defer any comments on any matters which are either before the Court or very likely to appear before the Court.’’ This has been a procedure which has been followed in the past and is one which I think is based upon sound, legal precedent.

Justice Marshall drew his line, yet we confirmed him by a vote of 69–11. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor drew her line, yet we confirmed her by a vote of 99–0. Justice Kennedy drew his line, yet we confirmed him by a vote of 97–0. Justice Ginsburg drew her line, yet we confirmed her by a vote of 96–3. Justice Breyer drew his line, yet we confirmed by a vote of 87–9.
We must use a judicial rather than a political standard to evaluate Judge Roberts’s fitness for the Supreme Court. That standard must be based upon the fundamental principle that judges interpret and apply, but do not make the law.
Judge Roberts, as every Supreme Court nominee has done in the past, you must decide how best to honor your commitment to judicial impartiality and independence. You must decide when that obligation is more important than what Senators, including this one, might want to know. As the Senate has done in the past, I believe we should honor your decision and make our own.
Judge Roberts, you have a tremendously complex and important and honorable record, from law school through the various positions in Government that you held, to the judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to now. We have a great deal of respect for you. We expect you to make a great Justice, and I just want to congratulate you on your nomination.
[The prepared statement of Senator Hatch appears as a submission for the record.]

STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. KENNEDY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS
Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, I join in welcoming you and your family to this Committee and to this famous room—the site of so many historic hearings. Today, our Nation’s flags are at half mast to honor the memory of Chief Justice Rehnquist and his deep dedication to his beloved Supreme Court. We know that Judge Roberts was especially close to him, and our thoughts and prayers go to the Rehnquist family and all who knew him. As we are all aware, the Senate’s action on this nomination is profoundly important. It is a defining opportunity to consider the values that make our Nation strong and just, and how to implement them more effectively, especially the guiding principle of more than two centuries of our history—that we are all created equal. Our commitment to this founding principle is especially relevant today. Americans are united as rarely before in compassion and generosity for our fellow citizens whose lives have been devastated by Hurricane Katrina. That massive tragedy also taught us another lesson. The powerful winds and floodwaters of Katrina tore away the mask that has hidden from public view the many Americans who are left out and

left behind. As one Nation under God, we cannot continue to ignore the injustice, the inequality, and the gross disparities that exist in our society.
Across the years, we have experienced times of great turmoil and great triumph as each succeeding generation struggled to live up to our founding principle and give it meaning for everyone. Americans have shed blood, campaigned, and marched. They have worked in countless quiet ways, as well, to see that every one of our citizens is part of our democracy and has an equal opportunity for a good education, a good job, and a good life.
Today, grandparents who were denied the right to vote expect their grandsons and granddaughters to be able to cast a ballot without discrimination or intimidation. And our society is better because of that progress.
Today, fathers and mothers expect their daughters to have the same opportunities as their sons to attend college, play sports, and earn fair pay. And our society is better because of that progress.
Today, parents expect their disabled children to live in hope—to receive an education that draws out their talent, enables them to reach for their dreams like all other Americans. And our society is better because of that progress.
Too many have sacrificed too much, worked too hard, come too far, to turn back the clock on that progress. Americans today expect their elected representatives to carry on the great unfinished business of making America the land of opportunity for all, and we expect our courts to defend our progress as their constitutional responsibility.
The challenge today is especially difficult because of the vast global economic changes and major new threats to our national security, and we need the ingenuity and innovation and commitment of every American.
Our military leaders are the first to say that highly qualified, racially diverse Armed Forces are essential to defend our country and the cause of freedom at home and abroad.
Every citizen counts, and we must continue to remove barriers that hold back millions of our people. We must draw strength from our diversity as we compete in a new world of promise and peril.
So the central issue before us in these hearings is whether the Supreme Court will preserve the gains of the past and protect the rights that are indispensable to a modern, more competitive, more equal America. Commitment to equality for all is not only a matter of fairness and conscience. It is also our path to sustained national strength and purpose.
We also are a Government of the people in which citizens have a strong voice in the great issues that shape our lives. Our system of checks and balances was drawn up in full awareness of the principle that absolute power corrupts absolutely and was designed to make sure that no branch of Government becomes so powerful that it can avoid accountability. The people have a right to know that their Government is promoting their interests, not the special interests, when it comes to the price of gasoline and the safety of prescription drugs, the air we breathe and the water we drink, and the food and other products we buy. The people have a right to

keep Government from intruding into their private lives and most personal decisions.
But the tragedy of Katrina shows in the starkest terms why every American needs an effective national Government that will step in to meet urgent needs that individual States and communities cannot meet on their own.
Above all, the people and their Congress must have a voice in decisions that determine the safety of our country and the integrity of our individual rights. We expect Supreme Court Justices to uphold those rights and the rule of law in times of both war and peace.
All this—and more—will be before the Supreme Court in the years ahead, and its judgments will affect the direction and character of our country for generations to come.
Judge Roberts, you are an intelligent, well-educated, and serious man. You have vast legal experience and you are considered to be one of the finest legal advocates in America. These qualities are surely important qualifications for a potential Supreme Court Justice. But they do not end the inquiry or our responsibility. This Committee and the full Senate must also determine whether you have demonstrated a commitment to the constitutional principles that have been so vital in advancing fairness, decency, and equal opportunity in our society.
We have only one chance to get it right, and a solemn obligation to do so. If you are confirmed, you could serve on the Court for a generation or more, and the decisions you make as a Justice will have a direct impact on the lives of our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren.
Because of the special importance of an appointment like yours, the Founders called for shared power between the President and the Senate. The Senate was not intended to be a rubber stamp for a President’s nominees to the Supreme Court—and, as George Washington himself found out, it has not been.
Judges are appointed ‘‘by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,’’ and it is our duty to ask questions on great issues that matter to the American people, and to speak for them. Judge Roberts, I hope you will respond fully and candidly to such questions, not just to earn our approval, but to prove to the American people that you have earned the right to a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land.
Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, there are real and serious reasons to be deeply concerned about Judge Roberts’s record. Many of his past statements and writings raise questions about his commitment to equal opportunity and to the bipartisan remedies we have adopted in the past. This hearing is John Roberts’s job interview with the American people. He will have a fair chance to express his values, state his views, and defend his record. The burden on him is especially heavy because the Administration, at least so far, has chosen not to allow the Senate to have access to his full record. We can only wonder what they don’t want us to know.
In particular, we need to know his views on civil rights, voting rights, and the right to privacy—especially the removal of existing barriers to full and fair lives for women, minorities, and the disabled.

From the start, America was summoned to be a shining city on a hill. But each generation must keep building that city. Even in this new century, some Americans are still denied a voice at the ballot box because of their color, denied a promotion because of their gender, denied a job because of their age, denied hope because they are gay, or denied an appropriate education because they are disabled. Long-established rights to privacy are under heavy siege.
We need a Chief Justice who believes in the promise of America and the guarantees of our Constitution, a person who will enter that majestic building near here and genuinely believe the four inspiring words inscribed in marble above the entrance: ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’
I look forward to hearing from Judge Roberts about whether, if he joins the Supreme Court, he will uphold the progress we have made and will guarantee that all Americans have their rightful place in the Nation’s future.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Kennedy appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Grassley?
STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA
Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Roberts, I welcome you and congratulate you on your nomination. I think it is fitting that you have been nominated to replace a mentor of yours, Chief Justice Rehnquist. You obviously have a tough act to follow, and that is because Chief Justice Rehnquist was a great Supreme Court Justice. He believed in the strict application of the law and the Constitution and was a consistent voice for judicial restraint. And we will all miss his leadership.
Judge Roberts, we had a good personal meeting in my office a little over a month ago, and based on our discussions and what I have reviewed, you appear to be extremely well qualified. At our meeting, I was encouraged by your respect for the limited role of the courts as an institution in our democratic society. I look forward to asking more questions about your record and qualifications, as well as your judicial approach. I also look forward to asking you about what you think are priorities for the Federal judiciary, as you now lead that branch.
Of course, as we reflect on the enormous build-up to this day and the packed hearing room filled with media lights and cameras, it is worth recalling the fact that judicial nominees never appeared before the Senate until 1925. Ever since then, for the most part, the hearings were not public spectacles. In 1962, for example, when Byron White was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Kennedy, the hearing before the Judiciary Committee lasted all of 15 minutes and eight questions. And it seems to me that the Senate sure got it right within Justice White. And Justice White went on to serve then for a generation.
Of course, all this was before we had televised hearings, which has encouraged ratcheting up the rhetoric to play to various constituencies. Furthermore, Judge Roberts, you are the first nominee

of the Internet age, with millions of eyes scrutinizing thousands of downloaded pages of writing, not to mention the hundreds of website blogs characterizing the documents that have been produced in an accurate or, more likely, inaccurate way, and opinion on every record that you have been involved with, and doing it by the minute.
So to some extent, there is no turning back from what we have created here, and you just happen to be the latest victim of such scrutiny.
During the Ginsburg nomination, Senator Biden, then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, urged that we not treat these hearings, in Senator Biden’s words, as ‘‘make-or-break trials’’ of ‘‘dramatic importance.’’ And I sure agree with what he said then.
Rather, the hearing provides a unique opportunity for us to ensure that each person appointed to the Federal bench will be a true judge and not some sort of super-legislator. The courts should not be made up of seats designated conservative, liberal, moderate. Rather, we have a responsibility to fill the Federal bench with individuals who will faithfully interpret the laws and the Constitution, individuals who will withhold any personal, political, or ideological tendencies from their decisionmaking process. And this is even more important when we are confirming you now to the Supreme Court as opposed to when we confirmed you to the circuit court.
There are a number of qualities that I look for in a Supreme Court nominee. I believe that the nominee should be someone who knows he or she is not appointed to impose his or her views of what is right or wrong. As Chief Justice Marshall said over 200 years ago, the duty of the judge is to say what the law ‘‘is,’’ not what it ‘‘ought to be.’’ Moreover, the nominee should be someone who not only understands, but truly respects the equal roles and responsibilities of the different branches of Government and the role of our States in the Federal system. If we confirm a nominee who is all of this, none of us—on the political right or the political left—will be disappointed, because it will mean in the end that the people, through their elected representatives, will be in charge. On the other hand, if we confirm individuals who are bent on assigning to themselves the power to ‘‘fix society’s problems’’ as they see fit, a bare majority of these nine unelected and unaccountable men and women will usurp the power of the people—hijacking democracy to serve their own political prejudices. We do not want to go down that road, and we should not go down that road.
Why is it, then, so important to have Supreme Court Justices practice judicial restraint? Because that means the policy choices of the democratically elected branches of Government will only be overturned if and when there is a clear warrant to do so in the Constitution itself. We want Supreme Court Justices to exercise judicial restraint so that cases will be decided solely on the law and the principles set forth in the Constitution, and not upon an individual Justice’s personal philosophical views or preferences. Felix Frankfurter identified this as the highest example of judicial duty. A fundamental principle of our country is that the majority has a legitimate right to govern. This approach hardly means that the courts are less energetic in protecting individual rights. But the words of the Constitution constrain judges every bit as much as

they control legislators, executives, and our citizens. Otherwise, we are no longer a Nation of laws, but a Nation of politicians dressed in judges’ robes.
During my tenure in the Senate, I have participated in a number of these Supreme Court nomination hearings, and I believe it is nine to date. I am hopeful that we will see a dignified confirmation process that will not degenerate into what we saw during the Bork and Thomas hearings. Rather, we need to see the same level of civility as we saw during the O’Connor, Ginsburg, and Breyer hearings.
Moreover, I am hoping that we will not see a badgering of the nominee about how he will rule on specific cases and possible issues that will or may come before the Court. That has not been the practice, as you know, in the past. And let me remind my colleagues that Justices Ginsburg and Breyer refused to answer questions on how they would rule on cases during their confirmation hearings. The fact is that no Senator has a right to insist on his or her own issue-by-issue philosophy or seek commitments from nominees on specific litmus-test questions likely to come before that Court. To do so is to give in to the liberal interest groups that only want judges who will do their political bidding from the bench, regardless of what is required by the law and the Constitution. The result is then a loss of independence for the Supreme Court and a lessening of our Government’s checks and balances.
Some have suggested that since you have been nominated now to be Chief Justice, you deserve even more scrutiny than before when you were just nominated for Associate. Some are saying that we should prolong the hearings and turn over even more stones than we have already turned over thus far. Well, the Chief Justice has been described as ‘‘first among equals.’’ The plain truth is that there really isn’t anything substantively different in your role, and your vote will count just the same as other Justices of the Court. So my own questioning and analysis of your qualifications will not really be much different from your previous appointment.
But it is true that the Chief Justice has additional duties as the head of the Federal judiciary. The Chief Justice has to be someone who has a good management style, who can run the trains on time, and who can foster collegiality on the Court. So, Judge Roberts, I think that since you have appeared before the Court 39 times to argue cases on appeal, and that the current Justices know and respect you, that bodes very well in terms of your smoothly transitioning into the Court, into the new role now of Chief Justice.
I congratulate you. [The prepared statement of Senator Grassley appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Grassley. Senator Biden?
STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE

So I do not think you have any worry, Judge, about having to cash in your independence. It has never occurred in my memory or in my study.
And, Judge, I want to point out to my friends that it is true judges did not come before the Committee in the past, but in the past you needed unanimous consent of the entire Senate to get before the Senate. So, you know, there are some good things and some bad things that have changed.
Judge, as you know, there is a genuine intellectual debate going on in our country today over whether the Constitution is going to continue to expand the protections of the right to privacy, continue to empower the Federal Government to protect the powerless. And it is a big debate. All you have got to do is turn to any website— American Enterprise Institute, left, right, center. It is a gigantic debate. It has not occurred, as you and I both know, and my colleagues know, in the last 70 years. It has not been this contentious—not just the politics but the debate, the intellectual debate.
For 70 years, there has been a consensus, Judge, on our Supreme Court on these issues of privacy and protecting the powerless, and this consensus has been fully embraced, in my view, by the American people. But there are those who strongly disagree with the consensus, as is their right, and they seek to unravel the consensus. And, Judge, you are in the unenviable position, as we talked about in my office, of being right in the middle of this fundamentally important debate. And, quite frankly, Judge, we need to know on which side of that divide you stand, for whoever replaces Justice Rehnquist, as well as Justice O’Connor, will play a pivotal role in this debate. And for tens of millions of the American people, this is no academic exercise, for the position you will take in this debate will affect their lives in very real and personal ways for at least, God willing, the next three decades. And there is nothing they can do about it after this moment.
Judge, I believe in, as our Supreme Court’s first great Chief, who has been mentioned here today, Justice Marshall, said in 1819, and I quote: ‘‘A Constitution intended to endure for ages to come, and consequently, to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.’’ That is the Constitution I believe in, and that is the way I think we should look at the Constitution.
At its core, the Constitution envisions ever-increasing protections for human liberty and dignity for all its citizens, and a national Government empowered to deal with these unanticipated crises. Judge, herein lies, in my view, the crux of the intellectual debate I referred to at the outset, whether we will have an ever-increasing protection for human dignity and human liberty, or whether those protections will be diminished, as suggested by many in their reading of the Constitution that says there are no unenumerated rights. That is a very narrow reading of the Constitution.
In 1925, the Constitution preserved the rights of parents to determine how to educate their kids, striking down a law that required children to attend public school. In 1965, the Constitution told the State to get out of married couples’ bedrooms, by striking down a State law prohibiting married couples from using contraception. In 1967, the Constitution defended the right of a black woman to marry a white man. In 1977, the Constitution stopped

a city from making it a crime for a grandmother to live with her grandchildren.
And, fortunately, even when the Supreme Court at first took the Constitution away from the promise and hope of our Constitution’s ennobling phrases, in the end it has kept the faith. In 1873, for example, the Court said States could forbid women from being lawyers. It took 100 years to undo this terrible mistake, but the Court eventually got it right. In 1896, the Supreme Court said separate but equal is lawful. It took 58 years for the Supreme Court to outlaw racial segregation, throwing the doctrine into the dust bin of history, but it got it right. In the early 1900s, the Court rendered the Federal Government powerless to outlaw child labor, to protect workers. It took until 1937 for the Supreme Court to see the error of its ways, but it finally got it right.
In every step we have had to struggle against those who saw the Constitution as frozen in time, Judge, but time and again we have overcome, and the Constitution has remained relevant and dynamic, thanks to the proper interpretation, in my view, of the ennobling phrases, purposely placed in what I refer to as our civic bible, the Constitution.
Once again, when it should be even more obvious to all Americans, we need increased protections for liberty as we look around the world and we see thousands of people persecuted because of their faith, women unable to show their faces in public, children maimed and killed for no other reason than they were born into the wrong tribe. Once again, when it should be obvious we need a more energetic national Government to deal with the challenges of the new millennium, terrorism, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, pandemic disease, and religious intolerance, and once again our journey of progress is under attack, and it is coming from, in my view, the right.
There are judges, scholars and opinion leaders who belong to this group of people who are good, honorable and patriotic Americans. They believe the Constitution provides no protection against Government intrusion into highly personal decisions like the Schiavo case, decisions about birth, about marriage, about family, about religion. There are those who would slash the power of our national Government, fragmenting it among the States in a new reading of the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments. Incredibly, some even argue, as you well know—people will not believe this—but some are arguing today, in the Constitution-in-Exile group, who argue that the national Government has no power to deal with what is going on in the Gulf at this moment.
Judge, I do not believe individuals could for very long have accomplished what we did had we read our Constitution in such a narrow way.
Like the Founders, I believe our Constitution is as big and as grand and as great as its people. Our constitutional journey did not stop with women being barred from being lawyers, with 10-yearolds working in coal mines, or with black kids forced into different schools than white kids, just because in the Constitution nowhere does it mention sex discrimination, child labor, segregation. It does not mention it. Our constitutional journey did not stop then, and it must not stop now, Judge.

We will be faced with equally consequential decisions in the 21st century. Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person’s body to track his every movement? There is actual discussion about that. You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over. Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior? You will rule on that.
And, Judge, I need to know whether you will be a Justice who believes that the constitutional journey must continue to speak to these consequential decisions, or that we have gone far enough in protecting against Government intrusion into our autonomy, into the most personal decisions we make. Judge, that is why this is a critical moment.
There are elected officials in this Government, such as Mr. DeLay, a fine, honorable, patriotic man, and others, who have been unsuccessful in implementing their agenda in the elected branches, so they have now poured their energies—as the left would—they have now poured their energy and resources into trying to change the Court’s view of the Constitution, and now they have a once-ina-lifetime opportunity, the filling of two Supreme Court vacancies, one of which is the Chief, and the other is for Associate Justice, the first time that has happened in 75 years.
Judge, I believe with every fiber of my being that their view of the Constitution and where the country should be taken would be a disaster for our people. Like most Americans, I believe the Constitution recognizes a general right to privacy. I believe a woman’s right to be nationally and vigorously protected exists. I believe that the Federal Government must act as a shield to protect the powerless against the economic interests of this country. And I believe the Federal Government should stamp out discrimination wherever it occurs, and I believe the Constitution inspires and empowers us to achieve these great goals.
Judge, if I look only at what you have said and written, as used to happen in the past, I would have to vote no. You dismissed the constitutional protection to privacy as ‘‘a so-called right.’’ You derided agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission that combat corporate misconduct, as ‘‘constitutional anomalies.’’ And you dismissed gender discrimination as ‘‘merely a perceived problem.’’ This is your charge, Judge, to explain what you meant by what you have said and what you have written. That is what I said when I was Chairman. That is what this is about.
The Constitution provides for one democratic moment, Judge, one democratic moment before a lifetime of judicial independence. This is that moment, when the people of the United States are entitled to know as much as they can about the person we are entrusting with safeguarding our future and the future of our children and grandchildren. Judge, as you know, and we talked about it, this is that moment, and this is what this hearing is about.
I thank you. [The prepared statement of Senator Biden appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. Senator Kyl.

STATEMENT OF HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA
Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before discussing Judge Roberts’s nomination, I would like to take a moment to express my respect and admiration for the Justice whom he will be replacing on the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, who began his career as a lawyer in Phoenix. In 1994, until last year, he made an annual return to Arizona to teach a course of Supreme Court history at my alma mater, the University of Arizona. Chief Justice Rehnquist provided steady leadership at the Supreme Court through several turbulent decades, showing in the process how much of a difference one person with great integrity can make. We mourn his loss. In spite of the fact that he is not from Arizona, Judge Roberts clearly is eminently qualified to serve as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Enough has already been said about his credentials, that I will not catalog them here. Rather, the principal matter that I would like to address today is the proper scope of this Committee’s questioning of the nominee. With all due respect to my colleagues, a seat on the Supreme Court is not a political, let alone a legislative office, and not every question that a Senator might think of is legitimate. This Committee’s precedents, the rules of judicial ethics, and a sound respect for the unique role of the Federal Judiciary in our society, all counsel in favor of some basic limits on the types of questions that a Senator should ask of a judicial nominee. One is not qualified for the Court by virtue of his position on issues, but rather, by his ability to judge fairly. Most importantly, it is not appropriate for a Senator to demand a nominee’s views on issues that are likely to come before the Court. This standard was reiterated 4 years ago by the late Lloyd Cutler, White House Counsel to former Democratic Presidents Carter and Clinton. In a hearing before this Committee on the subject of the Senate’s role in evaluating judicial nominees, Mr. Cutler stated quite clearly what the proper limits are, and I quote: ‘‘We viewers must refrain from asking candidates for particular precommitments about unresolved cases or issues that may come before them as judges.’’ And he continued, ‘‘The ultimate question is simply whether or not potential candidates have the qualities of integrity, good judgment and experience to become judicial officers of the United States. It would be a tragic development if ideology became an increasingly important consideration in the future. To make ideology an issue in the confirmation process is to suggest that the legal process is and should be a political one. That is not only wrong as a matter of political science, it also serves to weaken public confidence in the courts.’’ Just imagine, Mr. Chairman, expecting litigants to appear before a court knowing in advance what the ruling will be. Limits on the questioning of judicial nominees are reflected even in the questionnaire that this Committee submits to nominees. Question 27(b) of the Committee’s questionnaire makes clear that it is unacceptable for anyone involved in the process of selecting
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00031 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.000 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

the nominee to seek assurances about his positions on cases, questions or issues that might come before him as a judge.
Let me quote the question. ‘‘Has anyone involved in the process of selecting you as a judicial nominee, including but not limited to any member of the White House staff, the Justice Department, or the Senate or its staff, discussed with you any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on such case, issue or question? ’’
Judge Roberts answered in the negative to that question, and I think it would be ironic indeed if the Committee were now to demand that the nominee take stands on questions that may come before him as a member of the Court.
As Senator Hatch noted earlier, the confirmation hearings of the two most recent nominees, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer, confirmed this same principle. Those hearings were held under the chairmanship of our colleague, Senator Biden, who presided at the time. One of the comments that he made at the time of Justice Ginsburg’s hearing was, and I quote: ‘‘You not only have a right to choose what you will answer and not answer, but in my view, you should not answer a question of what your view will be on an issue that clearly is going to come before the Court.’’
Not only would it violate this Committee’s standards and procedures for a nominee to answer questions about issues that may come before him as a judge, it would also be unethical for the nominee to answer such questions. Some have argued that nominees cannot talk about cases, but that they can still talk about issues. Well, the Code of Judicial Ethics draws no such distinctions. The American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct dictates, and I quote, ‘‘that a judge or candidate for election or appointment to judicial office, shall not, with respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the Court, make pledges, promises of commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the judicative duties of the office.’’
The import of this ethical rule is unambiguous. If a nominee is asked to commit himself to a particular stance on an issue that is likely to come before him as a judge, that nominee is obligated to decline to answer the question. Any other approach would violate the Code of Judicial Conduct.
Judge Roberts, I expect you to adhere to the Code of Judicial Ethics, and I want you to know that I will defend your refusal to answer any question that you believe is improper under those circumstances.
I would also like to emphasize that the standards for questioning that apply in this Committee are not simply quaint relics of the past to be abandoned at no cost to the future. Rather, these rules are fundamental to preserving the nature and role of an independent Judiciary. A judicial nominations process that required candidates to make a series of specific commitments in order to navigate the maze of Senate confirmation, would undermine the very concept of a fair and independent Judiciary. Constitutional law would become a mere extension of politics, but in a less accountable and less democratic arena.

If the Supreme Court operated this way, if it simply enforced political commitments made during the confirmation process, why would we give the power of judicial review, the power to strike down laws made by other more accountable and democratic branches of the Government? Granting this kind of power to the Supreme Court, the power to override democratic majorities, makes sense only if what the Court is deciding is applying and upholding the rule of law and our Constitution. When the Court adheres to that neutral and unbiased role, rather than making policy like the other branches, it is enforcing principles that the people themselves have deemed so important that they should be installed in the constitutional firmament, and placed above the reach of transient majorities or the political compromises reached by elected representatives.
The Court’s legitimate authority derives not from commitments made during confirmation, but from its obligations embodied in the Constitution. I raise this matter not to suggest that all questions about a nominee’s understanding of the law are improper. Indeed, I think that an examination of the Court’s role, and the source of legitimacy of its authority, reinforces the importance of inquiring into a nominee’s judicial philosophy, of determining whether he is devoted to upholding and enforcing the laws and the Constitution as they were adopted by the people.
Our proper role this week is to determine whether Judge Roberts has the character, the legal ability and the judicial philosophy to fulfill that responsibility.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Kyl. Now, Senator Kohl.
STATEMENT OF HON. HERBERT KOHL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN
Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, let me also extend my welcome to you this afternoon and to your family. Judge Roberts, if confirmed you will succeed Justice Rehnquist and serve as only the 17th Chief Justice in the history of the United States, and the youngest in 200 years. You are nominated to a position of awesome power and responsibility. The decisions you and the other Justices make will shape the lives of every person in America for generations. Yet for only a few days this week will the people, through their Senators, be able to question and to judge you. That means that we on this Committee who will be questioning you have an awesome power and responsibility as well. Judge Roberts, our democracy, our rights and everything we hold dear about America are built on the foundation of our Constitution. That remarkable document has endured throughout our history. In the hands of the Supreme Court, the Constitution has established a right to equal education regardless of race, has guaranteed an attorney and a fair trial to all Americans, rich and poor alike. It has allowed women to keep private medical decisions private. It has allowed Americans to speak, vote and worship without interference from their Government. You will lead the Court in its most solemn duty to interpret the Constitution and the rights it grants to all Americans. The Court

has the last say in what will be the scope of our rights and the breadth of our freedoms. The Court even has power over which constitutional questions it will hear and which cases the Court will decide. That is why the Supreme Court is so vital to our lives, and who decides these issues, Judge Roberts, is therefore of unsurpassed importance.
Moreover, you will enjoy even greater authority as Chief Justice of the United States than your fellow Associate Justices. You will not only lead an entire branch of our Government if you are confirmed, but also you will have a less evident but an even more important power because it will be your sole responsibility to determine which Justices write which opinions when you are in the majority. Who writes the opinion governs the principle the case stands for, and whether the precedent it sets is broad and important or narrow and less consequential.
If you are confirmed for this lifetime position, your decisions and those of your colleagues will be the final word on the rights and freedoms of all Americans for decades to come. You will have no constraints on the decisions you reach, other than your understanding of the Constitution and your heart. That is why it is so essential that we, the democratic representatives in a democratic country, take this week to probe that understanding and that heart.
This process of lifetime tenure is unique in our system of Government. The President, Senators and Governors make decisions every day. Our choices and our opinions are transparent to the public, and every few years we are accountable for the decisions we make and the votes we cast. If the people do not like our votes or disagree with our record, then they vote for someone else and we are gone. Just as we want and need to know much more about you, we presume that you want the country to know a lot more about what is in your mind and in your heart. People in high places of public trust in this country have a responsibility to share their thoughts about important issues like civil rights, privacy, property rights, separation of church and state, civil liberties, and much more.
We hope you understand the need to be totally forthcoming in your answers to questions on these issues. Evasions, avoidance and hiding behind legal jargon simply will not suffice.
So the panel will ask you about some of the most important issues that you will face should you be confirmed, for example, the right to privacy. In early writings you questioned this freedom, calling it a ‘‘so-called right to privacy.’’ So we expect you to discuss with us your current thinking on this basic question.
This past term the Court decided a ground-breaking case concerning the Government’s power of eminent domain. The Supreme Court held that the Government may take private land not only for public use, but also for private development. Public opinion is opposed to this outcome, and so we look forward to hearing your views on this important issue.
The Supreme Court’s decisions may be most important when they address the breadth of our civil rights. Some people think that your early writings were cavalier and dismissing many civil rights protections. For example, you were active in efforts to narrowly define voting rights protections, and your narrow interpretation of

Congressional power to address civil rights and other important issues while a judge on the D.C. Circuit does give us some pause.
The American people deserve to know how you will approach cases involving voting rights, gender discrimination, violence against women, and affirmative action, among many others.
Finally, some speculate that if confirmed, you will seek to weaken the separation between church and state. Your critics point to positions you took as a Government attorney, critical of Supreme Court decisions on prayer in school. And so we need to hear your views about the Establishment Clause of the Constitution as well.
Judge Roberts, if confirmed, we can expect that you will serve 25 to 30 years as Chief Justice of the United States. You will likely become the most influential Justice of your generation. During these decades you will help shape the nature of our country and our democracy. It will be your job to give life and meaning to the broad and lofty promises of the Constitution—such essential principles as due process, equal protection and free speech, and to stand up for the civil rights and the liberties of the underrepresented and the unpopular.
Before we decide whether to entrust you with this power, we ask you to stand before the public and explain your views, express our hopes, and expound on your approach to the bedrock principles that guide us as a Nation.
We have an obligation to find out where you will take us before we decide whether we want you to lead us there, and most importantly, you have an obligation to tell us.
This would be an appropriate time to share my perspective on how I will judge a nominee. In judging this and other Supreme Court nominations my test has been judicial excellence. To me judicial excellence involves four elements.
First, a nominee must possess the competence, character and temperament to serve on the Supreme Court. He or she must have a keen understanding of the law and the ability to explain it in ways that the American people will understand.
Second, judicial excellence means that a Supreme Court Justice must have a sense of the values which form the core of our political and economic system. We have a right to require the nominee to understand and respect our constitutional values.
Third, judicial excellence requires a sense of compassion. The law is more than an intellectual game, and more than a mental exercise. As Justice Black said, ‘‘The Court stands against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered or because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice and public excitement.’’
A Supreme Court Justice must understand this. He or she must recognize that real people with real problems are affected by the decisions rendered by the Court. They must have a connection with and an understanding of the problems that people struggle with on a daily basis. Justice, after all, must be blind, but it should not be deaf.
And finally, judicial excellence requires candor before confirmation. We are being asked to give the nominee enormous power, so we want to know how he or she will exercise this power, and how

they see the world, and we need and we deserve to know what is in your mind and in your heart.
Judge Roberts, I am convinced that you satisfy the requirements of competence, character and temperament. I enjoyed meeting you a few weeks ago and appreciated our discussion. Your legal talents are undeniably impressive. Yet, while we are now familiar with your abilities, we still know precious little about your philosophies and views on crucial issues that you will face on the Supreme Court in the years ahead.
We look forward to these hearings as an opportunity to learn more and measure whether you meet our test of judicial excellence.

STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE DEWINE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO
Senator DEWINE. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Judge Roberts, I congratulate you on your nomination, applaud you on your extraordinary legal career, and welcome you and your wife, Jane, and your children Jack and Josie to our hearing. Over the next several days we will be spending a lot of time together, you and the 18 Members of this Committee and the American people. This is the time really for a national conversation, a conversation about the document that binds us all together as a Nation and as a people. That document of course is our Constitution. For more than 215 years we have been having an extended conversation about the meaning of our Constitution. Sometimes the conversation has been civil, sometimes it has been passionate, and sometimes, tragically, it has been violent. The New Deal and the court battles that were fought about the scope of the Federal Government’s power to combat the Great Depression was really a debate about the meaning of the Constitution. The civil rights movement and the vigorous and often violent resistance to the efforts to bring about equality for all Americans, was and remains a debate about the meaning of our Constitution. The Civil War, the most violent and bloodiest time in our history, was really a war about the meaning of our Constitution. We have seen a President resign, elections decided, and popular laws overturned all because of our Constitution. But our Constitution is more than just a symbol of our Nation’s history. It is also a light for the rest of the world. As a Nation we were among the first to sit down and draft a document that quite literally constitutes our Government, but we were not the last. Since our Founders embraced the idea of a written Constitution, others have followed suit. In fact, after the fall of the Soviet regime, we witnessed an explosion of constitution writing in Eastern Europe. There are now more than 170 written constitutions in the world, more than half of which have been drafted just in the last 30 years. To paraphrase Thomas Paine, the cause of America truly is indeed the cause of all mankind.

That is why our gathering today is so significant. We are charged with providing our advice and consent on the President’s nominee to the Supreme Court. Our job is important. But if confirmed, Judge Roberts, your job, your job will be even more important. It would be your job, as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States, to correctly construe that Constitution, to preserve the balance of power sewn into it, and to protect those rights and values that are so much a part of our history and our tradition.
Former Chief Justice John Marshall once warned that, and I quote, ‘‘People made the Constitution, and people can unmake it.’’ It will be your job, in other words, to ensure that our Constitution is never unmade.
As of late, however, many Americans believe that the Supreme Court is unmaking the very Constitution that our Founders drafted. Many Americans are concerned when they see the Court strike down laws protecting the aged, the disabled and women who are the victims of violence. Many Americans worry when they see the Court permit the taking of private property for economic development. Many are troubled when they see the Court cite international law in its decisions, and many fear that our Court is making policy when it repeatedly strikes down laws passed by elected members of Congress and elected members of State legislatures.
I must tell you, Judge, I too am concerned. Judges are not members of Congress. They are not elected. They are not members of State legislatures. They are not Governors. They are not Presidents. Their job is not to pass laws, implement regulations, nor to make policy. Perhaps no one said this better than Justice Byron White. During his confirmation hearing in 1962, White was asked to explain the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional form of Government. Nowadays, in response to this type question, we probably would hear some grand theories about the meaning of the Constitution and its history.
Justice White, however, said nothing of the kind. When he was asked about the role of the Supreme Court in our system of Government, he gave a simple answer. Justice White said the role of the United States Supreme Court was simply to decide cases.
To decide cases. So simple. It sounds too obvious to be true, but, you know, I think that is the right answer. Judges need to restrict themselves to the proper resolution of the case before them. They need to avoid the temptation to set broad policy. And they need to pay proper deference to the role of the Executive, the Congress, and the States, while closely guarding the language of the Constitution.
We would do well to keep this example in mind. The Constitution does not give us all the answers. It does, however, create the perfect process for solving our problems. The Congress and the President have a role in this process, the States have theirs, and when there are disputes, the courts are there to decide cases.
There is a reason that judges need to take on this limited role. As my esteemed colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, explained during Justice Souter’s confirmation hearing, a judge should not be—and I quote—‘‘pro this and anti that. He should rather be a judge of cases, not causes.’’

Judge Roberts, causes come and go, but cases do not. In years or decades, one cause may fade, another will merge. But judges will remain deciding cases and interpreting our Constitution. Our next Chief Justice is not merely for today. He is a Chief Justice for the future, a future that will present constitutional issues that are now simply unknown.
The career of Chief Justice Rehnquist certainly proves this point. When he joined the Court in 1972, there was no Internet, no need to protect our children from the proliferation of online pornography; and at the time, there was no war on terror, no presidential order to detain terrorists as enemy combatants, and no terrorist prison at Guantanamo Bay. But yet, Chief Justice Rehnquist dealt with all of these issues while on the Court.
When faced with new and unexpected issues, a Justice is left only with the tools that every good judge must use: the facts of the case, the language of the Constitution, and the weight of precedent. This is a simple, unlimited approach to deciding cases, the kind of approach that Justice White would have understood and, I believe, that our Founders would have admired.
While preparing for this hearing, I came across a statement from a sitting Federal judge that I think neatly sums up this philosophy. ‘‘Deciding cases,’’ this judge said—and I quote—‘‘requires an essential humility grounded in the properly limited role of an undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic, a humility reflected in doctrines of deference to legislative policy judgments and embodied in the often misunderstood term ‘judicial restraint.’ ’’
Judge Roberts, as you know, those words are yours. And in my opinion, they are very wise words indeed. You, sir, have the talent, experience, and humility to be an outstanding member of the United States Supreme Court. And I expect that these hearings will show that you have the appropriate philosophy to lead our Nation into the future as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States.
I thank the chair. [The prepared statement of Senator DeWine appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator DeWine. Senator Feinstein?
STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Judge Roberts and Mrs. Roberts and the Roberts family. This must be a moment of enormous pride for you. I hope that, despite the toughness of this hearing, you really realize that this family member of yours is taking over not just the position of an Associate Justice, but the Chief Justice of the United States, at a time of unique division and polarization in this country. And so many of us are going to be pressing him to see if he has what we think it takes to do this. And Fred Thompson, welcome back. I hope you miss us just a little bit from time to time. Somehow I am not quite sure that is the case. [Laughter.]

Senator FEINSTEIN. Judge Roberts, thank you very much. We spent a very interesting hour together. I came away from it feeling that you are certainly brilliant, talented, and well-qualified. I do not think there is a question about that. But as we take a look at you, 50 years old, to be Chief Justice of the United States, I think it is really essential for us to try to determine whether you can be the kind of leader that can generate consensus, find compromise, and, above all, really embody the mainstream of American legal thinking. For me, the most important thing is to see that the Chief Justice really cares about the fact that justice is provided to all Americans. It has been said here before, but it is really important—young and old, rich and poor, powerful and weak, all races, creeds, colors, et cetera.
This is going to be a big session. The Court is going to consider some very critical cases among many others: The standard of review for abortion cases, the health of the mother; the constitutionality of an Oregon law which permits physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill but legally competent individuals; and whether two oil industry leaders and competitors can be allowed to work together to fix the price of gas once they have entered into a joint venture. In addition, the rights of enemy combatants, the so-called partial-birth abortion law, whether Congress has the authority to protect our Nation’s environment through legislation. The Endangered Species Act is winding its way through the appellate courts. It looks like they differ, and if the courts keep going the way they are going, many of us feel that they will take away from the Congress the grounds on which we base legislation in the environment. This is an enormous macro-question that you are going to be right in the middle of as a pivotal force.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, I believe, will be remembered not only for his distinguished tenure, which it certainly was, but also for applying a much more restrictive interpretation of the Constitution, which has limited the role of Congress. In recent years, the Court has adopted a politically conservative States’-rights view of several constitutional provisions. As a result, congressional authority to enact important legislation has been significantly curtailed. This has occurred through its restrictive interpretation of the Spending Clause, the Commerce Clause, the 14th Amendment, the 11th Amendment, all of which Congress uses to enact certain laws.
Based on these federalism grounds, the Court has wiped out all, or key parts, of legislation addressing issues such as gun-free schools—should schools be allowed to prohibit guns within 1,000 feet; religious freedom; overtime protections; age discrimination; violence against women; and discrimination against people with disabilities. In fact, over the past decade, the Rehnquist Court has weakened or invalidated more than three dozen Federal statutes. Almost a third of these decisions were based on the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment. If you, Judge Roberts, subscribe to the Rehnquist Court’s restrictive interpretation of Congress’s ability to legislate, the impact could be enormous. It would severely restrict the ability of a Congress to tackle nationwide issues that the American people have actually elected us to address.
Now, as the only woman on this Committee, I believe I have an additional role in evaluating nominees for the Supreme Court, and

that is to see if the hard-earned autonomy of women is protected. Like any population, women enjoy diverse opinions, beliefs, political affiliations, priorities, and values. And we share a history of having to fight for many of the rights and opportunities that young American women now take so much for granted. I think they do not really recall that during the early years of the United States, women actually had very few rights and privileges. In most States, women were not allowed to enter into contracts, to act as executor of an estate; they had limited inheritance and child-custody rights. It actually was not until 1839 that a woman could own property separate from her husband, when Mississippi passed the Married Woman’s Property Act.
It was not until the 19th century that women began working outside their homes in large numbers. Most often, women were employed as teachers or nurses and in textile mills and garment shops. As women entered into the workforce, we had to fight our way into nontraditional fields—medicine, law, business, and yes, even politics.
The American Medical Association was founded in 1846, but it barred women for 69 years from membership, until 1915. The American Bar Association was founded in 1876, but it barred women and did not admit them until 1918. That is 42 years later. And it was not until 1920 when, after a very hard fight, women won the right to vote—not even 100 years ago.
By virtue of our accomplishments and our history, women have a perspective, I think, that has been recognized as unique and valuable. With the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the Court loses the important perspective she brought as a woman and the deciding vote in a number of critical cases.
For me—and I said this to you privately, and I will say more about it in my time on questions—one of the most important issues that needs to be addressed by you is the constitutional right to privacy. I am concerned by a trend on the Court to limit this right and thereby to curtail the autonomy that we have fought for and achieved—in this case, over just simply controlling our own reproductive system, rather than having some politicians do it for us. It would be very difficult—and I said this to you privately and I have said it publicly—for me to vote to confirm someone who I knew would overturn Roe v. Wade because I remember—and many of the young women here do not—what it was like when abortion was illegal in America.
As a college student at Stanford, I watched the passing of the plate to collect money so a young woman could go to Tijuana for a back-alley abortion. I knew a young woman who killed herself because she was pregnant. And in the 1960s, then, as a member of the California Women’s Board of Terms and Parole, when California had what was called the Indeterminate Sentencing Law, I actually sentenced women who committed abortions to prison terms. I saw the morbidity, I saw the injuries they caused. And I do not want to go back to those days.
How the Court decides future cases could determine whether both the beginning-of-life and the end-of-life decisions remain private or whether individuals could be subject to Government intrusion or perhaps the risk of prison.

And I will be looking to understand your views on the constitutional provision for providing for the separation of church and state. Once again, history. For centuries, individuals have been persecuted for their religious beliefs. During the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Reformation, and even today, millions of innocent people have been killed or tortured because of their religion.
A week ago, I was walking up the Danube River in Budapest when I saw on the shore 60 pair of shoes covered in copper—women’s shoes, men’s shoes, small, tiny children’s shoes. They lined the bank of the river.
My time is already up? May I just finish this one paragraph? Chairman SPECTER. Yes. Senator FEINSTEIN. During World War II, it turned out that Hungarian Fascists and Nazi soldiers forced thousands of Jews, including men, women, and children, to remove their shoes before shooting them and letting their bodies float down the Danube. These shoes represent a powerful symbol of how religion has been used in catastrophic ways historically. The rest of my comments we will have to wait for. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA
Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Judge Roberts, recalling the words of former Senator Alan Simpson when Justice Scalia was here, welcome to the pit.

Some have called you the finest appellate lawyer of your generation. You have won the respect of your colleagues, adversaries, and judges for your integrity, professionalism, and legal skill. And I salute President Bush for choosing you for this important position. But as you have already seen, our confirmation process is not a pretty sight. Time and again you will have your legal positions, your predecisional memoranda, even as a young lawyer, distorted or taken out of context. These attacks are driven most often by outside groups. They will dig through the many complex cases you have dealt with in an effort to criticize your record. They will produce on cue the most dire warnings that civil liberties in America will be lost forever if you are confirmed as a Federal judge. It is really a form attack sheet. All they have to do is place your name in the blank space. These tactics, I think, are unfair and sometimes have been dishonest. My advice to you is this: Keep your famous good humor, take your time, and explain the procedural posture of the cases and exactly how you ruled as a judge or the position you took as a lawyer. Americans know these matters are complex and they will appreciate your answers.

The American commitment to the rule of law is one of our most exceptional characteristics as a people. It is the foundation of our liberties and our productive economic system, it is a product of centuries of development. In his magnificent speech in March of 1775 in the House of Commons urging King George not to go to war against the Colonies, Edmund Burke described America’s commitment to the rule of law by saying, ‘‘In no country perhaps in the world is the law so general a study,’’ adding, ‘‘I hear they may have sold as many of Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Law in America as in England.’’
But activism by a growing number of judges threatens our judiciary. And frankly, that is what I am hearing as I talk to my constituents and hear from the American people. Activism is when a judge allows his personal views on a policy issue to infect his judgments. Activist rulings are not based on statutes or the Constitution, but reflect whatever a judge may think is decent or public policy.
This should not be. But even some members of our body have encouraged this thinking. Indeed, Judge Roberts, one Senator in recent weeks, the man did not know whose side you are on before he voted. His statement provides a direct glance, I think, into the philosophy of activism. When we have an activist judiciary, the personal views of a judge become everything. Who the judge is and whose side the judge is on, not the law and the facts, will determine the outcome of a case. Since judges hold their offices for as long as they live or choose to serve, and are unaccountable to the citizenry, activist rulings strike at the heart of democracy. Five members of the Court may effectively become a continuing constitutional convention on important questions such as taking of private property, the definition of marriage, the Pledge of Allegiance, or a moment of silence before a school day.
If a Congress acts wrongly, new members may be elected and a result changed by a simple majority. A Supreme Court decision founded on the Constitution can be changed by the people only by constitutional amendment, which requires a two-thirds vote of both houses and three-fourths of the State legislatures.
This result-driven philosophy of activism does not respect law. It is a post-modern philosophy that elevates outcomes over law. Today many believe the law does not have an inherent moral power and that words do not have and cannot have fixed meanings. Judges are thus encouraged to liberally interpret the words to reach the result the judge believes is correct. Activist Supreme Court judges have done this in recent years by saying they are interpreting the plain words of the Constitution in light of evolving standards of decency. This phrase has actually formed the legal basis for a number of recent decisions. But as a legal test, it utterly fails because the words can mean whatever a judge wants them to mean. It is not objective, cannot be consistently followed, and is thus by definition not law, but a license.
Such vague standards provide the Court a license to legislate, a power the Constitution did not provide judges. Indeed, recently this license has led some judges to conclude they may look beyond American standards of decency to the standards of foreign nations in an attempt to justify their decisions. The arrogant nature of this

31
concept is further revealed by a Supreme Court ruling in 2003, when the Supreme Court explicitly declared that the Constitution prohibits the elected representatives of the people—us—from relying on established morality as a basis for the laws they pass. The Court thus declares itself free to, in effect, amend the Constitution by redefining its words to impose whatever it decides is evolving standards of decency. Yet at the same time, it prohibits legislatures from enacting laws based on objective standards of morality.
While these unprincipled decisions are becoming too frequent, I do not want to suggest that such is the common practice in courts in America. Having practiced full-time in Federal court for 14 years, I witnessed this first-hand. Day after day, if the law and facts were on my side, I would win consistently. If they were not, I would lose. This was true regardless of whether a judge was a Democrat, a Republican, a liberal, or a conservative. Certainly our Founders were so adamant that judges be unbiased and committed to the law that they drafted a Constitution that gave them a lifetime appoint and provided that Congress could not even reduce their pay.
My fear today is that many have come to believe that to expect objectivity in judges is hopelessly naive. Liberals and conservatives openly make this point. On one committee, one that Senator Kyl quoted Lloyd Cutler as testifying at, we focused on the question of whether or not ideology could be a factor in a judge’s rulings and that we should in effect admit that people have political views and that those political views will infect their rulings and therefore we should openly talk about that. A writer in the conservative National Review complained that Republicans are hurting the conservative cause by insisting on ‘‘abiding by those outdated norms,’’ in effect suggesting conservatives should get their guys in there to promote their ideas.
While many advocates on the left and right would like a Court that promotes their agenda, I do not want that and neither do the American people. What we must have, what our legal system demands, is a fair and unbiased umpire, one who calls the game according to the existing rules and does so competently and honestly every day. This is the American ideal of law. Ideals are important because they form the goals to which we all strive. We must never abandon our ideal of unbiased judges, judges who rule fairly without regard to politics.
Two important bipartisan commissions, the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia, and the Citizens for Independent Courts, have issued reports that deplore any policies that would tend to politicize the courts. These hearings, therefore, provide this Nation an excellent opportunity to discuss these important concepts. Our Nation cries out for judges who love the law and who work every day to uphold its moral authority. The people rightly demand judges who follow, not make, law.
From everything I have seen and from what I have read, Judge Roberts, you are just the man to fill that need. Straight from central casting. We unanimously confirmed you 2 years ago to the Court of Appeals. I am confident that after this exhaustive process you will be confirmed to the august position of Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Judge Roberts, I also want to thank you in advance for the long hours you will put in with us this week. I wish you well, and I truly do admire your record and your impressive career.
This is a confirmation proceeding, however, not a coronation. It is the Senate Judiciary Committee’s job to ask tough questions. We are tasked by the Senate with getting a complete picture of your qualifications, your temperament, and how you will carry out your duties. Obviously, nominees to the Supreme Court must be subject to the highest level of scrutiny, and so as the nominee to be the Chief Justice of the United States, you will be subject to the ultimate level of scrutiny. Our colleagues in the Senate and the citizens of this country are entitled to a hearing that will actually help them decide whether you should be confirmed. And I am sure you understand that.
This is a lifetime appointment to preside over the Supreme Court and lead the entire Federal judiciary. You are obviously very talented, and you also look healthy. So I am sure—
[Laughter.] Senator FEINGOLD. I am sure you appreciate the importance of this hearing for the future of our country. Some have called for a dignified process. So have I. But at times, it sounds like what some really want for the nominee is an easy process. That is not what the Constitution or the traditions of the Senate call for. If by dignified they mean that tough and probing questions are out of bounds, I must strongly disagree. It is not undignified to ask questions that press the nominee for his views on the important areas of the law that the Supreme Court confronts. It is not undignified to review and explore the nominee’s writings, his past statements, the briefs he has filed, the memos he has written. It is not undignified to ask the nominee questions he would rather not answer should he prefer to remain inscrutable or, worse yet, all things to all people. This process is not a game. It is not a political contest. It is one of the most important things that the Senate does—confirm or reject nominees to the highest court in the land—and we as Senators must take that responsibility very seriously. The most recent nine Justices of the Supreme Court served together almost as long as any other Court in history, more than 11 years. Because the Court has been so stable for so long, and Chief Justice Rehnquist presided over it for 19 years, Members of Congress and lawyers and the public have come to know the views of the Justices pretty well. Many Court watchers have become pretty

good at predicting the outcome of cases. That predictability is about to be tested because we will now have a new Chief Justice and because a member of the Court who was the deciding vote in many cases has also announced her retirement.
I do not think, however, that the public is required to wait until a new Chief Justice is seated on the Court to get some idea of how that new Chief Justice thinks, how that new Chief Justice will approach controversial issues that might come before the Court, and how that new Chief Justice also might run the Court. This hearing is our only opportunity to hear from this nominee how he would approach the important issues facing the Court.
In fact, I was struck as I was preparing for this hearing by remarks written years ago by Senator Grassley, my friend and colleague from Iowa and a senior member of this Committee, in the Committee Report on the nomination of Justice O’Connor. The current nomination to the position of Chief Justice makes his remarks even more apt. Senator Grassley said the following: ‘‘I do not agree that commenting on past Supreme Court decisions is a commitment to hold a certain way on future cases, and I feel that in order that we as Senators fulfill our duty, it is incumbent upon us to discover a nominee’s judicial philosophy. In that we had a very limited number of judicial opinions rendered by Judge O’Connor on constitutional questions, it was my hope,’’ Senator Grassley said, ‘‘by asking specific questions regarding past Supreme Court decisions, that the Committee might obtain a clearer understanding of her philosophy. My purpose was to satisfy my questions regarding Judge O’Connor’s record in that I felt it was less complete than many other Supreme Court nominees who have had extensive experience either on the Federal bench or in leadership positions in the profession of law.’’
In some ways, Mr. Chairman, the record of our current nominee to the Court raises similar questions. He has a long record as a lawyer, but he has been on the Federal bench for only 2 years, and we have little in the way of his own writings on the issues before the Court to evaluate.
So, like Senator Grassley, I am interested in this nominee’s views on a number of cases. I don’t think that getting his reaction to those decisions will commit him to vote a certain way in a future case. After all, it is not that past case he will be deciding, but a different one. Even the current Justices, whose views on specific cases are well known, since they either wrote or joined one opinion or another, do not have to recuse themselves from a future case just because we know what they think of a crucial precedent in that case.
So I am looking for Judge Roberts to be forthcoming with this Committee about his views. So, to show the Senate’s role in this process the respect it deserves, he should make every effort to be responsive.
Chief Justice Rehnquist himself acknowledged the importance of the Senate’s role when he wrote the following in his last annual report on the Federal judiciary: ‘‘Our Constitution has struck a balance between judicial independence and accountability, giving individual judges secure tenure but making the Federal judiciary sub-

34
ject ultimately to the popular will because judges are appointed and confirmed by elected officials.’’
Now, that suggests to me that it is not only permissible, but critical, that the Senate seek to learn as much as it can about the views of nominees and that nominees be as forthcoming as they possibly can be without compromising their independence.
Now, we do have a mountain of material from the nominee’s early years as a lawyer in the Justice Department and White House Counsel’s office of the Reagan Administration. In memo after memo, his writing was highly ideological and sometimes dismissive of the views of others. I do, however, recognize that this is a different time, and he has been nominated to play a different kind of role than he played in those early Reagan years.
So, frankly, I will be looking for a somewhat different John Roberts than the John Roberts of 1985. As I have a chance to ask questions about topics such as executive power, civil liberties, voting rights, the death penalty, and other important issues, I hope to see how his views have developed and changed over the years. Of course, the best evidence of this would be some more recent writings of the nominee. But the administration has steadfastly refused a reasonable request for documents pertaining to a small fraction of the cases in which he participated as Deputy Solicitor General during the administration of President George H.W. Bush. I find this refusal very troubling in light of the ample precedent for releasing such documents in this kind of proceeding and the weakness of any claim that the release would damage the litigating position of the United States over 12 years later.
I also must say, candidly, the refusal gives rise to a reasonable inference that the administration has something to hide here. The administration has done this nominee no service by maintaining its intransigent position.
Mr. Chairman, it goes without saying that the Supreme Court is one of the most important institutions in our constitutional system and that the position of Chief Justice of the United States is one of the most important positions in our Government. The impact of this nominee on our country, should he be confirmed, will be enormous. That means our scrutiny of this nominee must be intense and thorough. In my view, we must evaluate not only his qualifications but also his ability to keep an open mind, his sensitivity to the concerns of all Americans and their right to equal protection under the laws, not only his intellectual capacity but his judgment and wisdom, not only his achievements but his fairness and his courage to stand up to the other branches of Government when they infringe on the rights and liberties of our citizens.
Judge Roberts, I look forward to the opportunity to question you, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman, again for the opportunity to speak today.
[The prepared statement of Senator Feingold appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Feingold. We will take a 15-minute break, and Senator Graham will be recognized for his opening statement at 2:15. [Recess 2:00 to 2:15 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will resume our opening statements.

Senator Graham, you are recognized for your opening statement.
STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for the seventh-inning stretch, too. We all very much appreciate it.
Judge Roberts, playing a little bit off of what my colleague Senator Feingold said, I don’t think you expect it to be easy. And having to listen to 18 Senators proves the fact that it is not going to be easy. But I hope that we will live up to our end of the bargain to make it fair. And ‘‘fair’’ is something that comes around in September in South Carolina, or it can be an idea. The idea of treating you fairly is very important to me because not only are you on display but the Senate is on display. And Senator Kennedy said something that I disagree with, but he is very passionate in his statement. He said the central issue is whether or not you will embrace policies, a certain set of policies or whether or not you will roll back certain policy decisions.
I respectfully disagree with Senator Kennedy. To me, the central issue before the Senate is whether or not the Senate will allow President Bush to fulfill his campaign promise to appoint a wellqualified strict constructionist to the Supreme Court, and in this case, to appoint a Chief Justice to the Supreme Court in the mold of Justice Rehnquist.
He has been elected President twice. He has not hidden from the public what his view of a Supreme Court Justice should be and the philosophy that they should embrace. In my opinion, by picking you, he has lived up to his end of the bargain with the American people by choosing a well-qualified strict constructionist. You have been described as brilliant, talented, and well qualified, and that is by Democrats. The question is: Is that enough in 2005 to get confirmed? Maybe not.
Professor Michael Gerhardt has written an article in 2000 called ‘‘The Federal Appointments Process,’’ and I think he has given some advice to our Democratic friends in the past, and maybe recently, about the confirmation process that we are engaged in today. And he has written, ‘‘The Constitution establishes a presumption of confirmation that works to the advantage of the President and his nominee.’’
I agree with that. Elections matter. We are not here to debate how to solve all of the Nation’s problems. We are not here to talk about liberal philosophy versus conservative philosophy and what is best for the country. We are here to talk about you and whether or not you are qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, whether or not you have the intellect, the integrity, and the character. And it has been said in the past by members of this Committee—Senator Kennedy, and I believe is recognized by most Senators—that we are not charged with the responsibility of approving Justices if their views always coincide with our own. We are really interested in knowing whether the nominee has the background, experience, qualifications, temperament, and integrity to handle the most sensitive, important, and responsible job, and that is, being on the Supreme Court.

If you are looking for consistency, you have probably come to the wrong place, because the truth of the matter is that we are all involved in the electoral process ourselves, and we have different agendas. Your memos are going to be talked about. The memos you wrote while you were working for President Reagan and Bush I in my opinion reflect a conservative lawyer advising a conservative President about conservative policies. And to some, those policies make no sense. Those policies are out of the mainstream. But this hearing is about whether or not you are qualified and whether or not Reagan conservativism is in the mainstream.
Does affirmative action require quotas? From a conservative’s point of view, no. From a conservative point of view, we do not want Federal judges setting the value of someone’s wages from the bench. And you wrote about that. Now, some people want that, but conservatives do not.
Environmental policies. We want a clean environment. We do not want to ruin the economy in the process. We want to be able to build levees to protect cities. Conservatives have a different view of a lot of issues versus our friends on the other side. The election determines how that shakes out.
We are here to determine whether or not you and all you have done in your life makes you a fitting candidate to be on the Supreme Court. Before we got here, the Senate was in disarray. May 23rd of this year, I engaged in a compromise agreement with seven Democrats and seven Republicans to keep the Senate from blowing itself up. You are the first nomination that we have dealt with in any significant manner after that agreement. There is plenty of blame to go around, Judge Roberts. On our watch, I am sure we did things in Committee that were very unfair to Democratic nominees, particularly by President Clinton. And at the time of that agreement, there were ten people being filibustered for the first time in the history of the Senate in a partisan manner that were going to be on the court of appeals.
We were in chaos. We were at each other’s throats. And since May 23rd, we have done better. The Senate has gotten back to a more traditional role when it comes to judges, and as Senator Specter described the Committee, we have done some good things here on this Committee and in the Senate as a whole.
I hope we will take the chance to start over because the public approval of the Senate now is in the 30s. And that is not your fault, Judge Roberts. It is our fault. We have an opportunity as Senators to show that we can disagree based on philosophy but give you a fair shake. The question is whether we will rise to the occasion. I am hopeful we will based on the statements being made.
What is the standard for a Senator to confirm a Supreme Court nominee? Whatever the Senator wants it to be. And, really, that is the way it should be. But there should be some goals, in my opinion. The way we conduct ourselves, one of the goals we should have is to make sure we don’t run good people away from wanting to be a judge. I do not know what it is like to sit at home and turn on the television and watch a commercial about you in the presence of your wife and your kids that say some pretty unflattering things about you. That is just not a problem you have faced. I am sure Democratic nominees have faced the same type problem.

We should not in our standard, trying to come up with a standard, invalidate elections. The President won. The President told us what he is going to do, and he did it. He picked a strict constructionist to be on the Supreme Court. If anybody is surprised, they were not listening to the last campaign.
Roe v. Wade—it divides America. If you believe in polling, most Americans would like to see the decision stand, even though we are divided 50/50 on the idea of abortion on demand. My good friend from California has expressed a view about Roe v. Wade, which I completely understand and respect. I can just tell you, Judge Roberts, there are plenty of women in South Carolina who have an opposite view about abortion.
If we were to base our votes on that one principle, Justice Ginsburg would not be Justice Ginsburg. In her writings, she embraced the idea of Federal funding for abortion. She indicated that an abortion right was based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. I dare say that 90 percent of the Republican Caucus is pro-life. I dare say that 90 percent of the Democratic Caucus is pro-choice. Justice Ginsburg got 96 votes, even though she expressed a view of the Federal Government’s role in abortion that I completely disagree with, and I think most conservatives disagree with.
There was a time not too long ago, Judge Roberts, where it was about the way you lived your life, how you conducted yourself, what kind of lawyer you were, what kind of man or woman you were, not whether you had an allegiance to a specific case or a particular cause. Let’s get back to those days. Let’s get back to the days where the Ginsburgs and the Scalias can be pushed and pressed, but they can be honored for their commitment to the law and the way they lived their life. Let’s get back to the good old days where we understood that what we were looking for was wellqualified people to sit on the highest Court of the land, not political clones of our own philosophy.
The reason I signed the agreement more than anything else was that I love the law. The role of the law in our society is so important. You take out the rule of law and you do not have a democracy. The law, Judge Roberts, to me represents a quiet place in American discourse. Politics is a loud, noisy, and destructive place. But the courtroom is a quiet place where the weak can challenge the strong and the unpopular can be heard. I know you will honor the rule of law in our country and that you will be a judge that we all can be proud of.
God bless you and your family. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Graham. Senator Schumer?
STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK
Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Judge Roberts, welcome to you and Mrs. Roberts, your parents, your family, your two beautiful children. I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your nomination to the position of Chief Justice of the United States. Now, this is indisputably the rarest opportunity in American Government. In the entire history of the Republic, we

38
have had but 16 Chief Justices. But the responsibility is as great as the opportunity is rare.
The decisions of the Supreme Court have a fundamental impact on people’s lives, and the influence of a Chief Justice far outlasts that of a President. As the youngest nominee to the High Court’s top seat in 204 years, you have the potential to wield more influence over the lives of the citizens of this country than any jurist in history. I cannot think of a more awesome responsibility—awesome not in the way my teenage daughter would use the word, but in the Biblical sense of the angels trembling in the presence of God.
But before you can assume that responsibility, we Senators, on behalf of the people, have to exercise our own responsibility. Fundamental to that responsibility is our obligation to ascertain your legal philosophy and judicial ideology. To me, the pivotal question which will determine my vote is this: Are you within the mainstream, albeit the conservative mainstream, or are you an ideologue who will seek to use the Court to impose your views upon us as certain judges, past and present, on the left and on the right, have attempted to do?
The American people need to learn a lot more about you before they and we can answer that question. You are without question an impressive, accomplished, and brilliant lawyer. You are a decent and honorable man. You have a remarkable resume. There are those who say your outstanding and accomplished resume should be enough, that you should simply promise to be fair and that we should confirm. I disagree. To me, the most important function of these hearings, because it is the most important qualification for a nominee to the Supreme Court, is to understand your legal philosophy and judicial ideology. This is especially true now that judges are largely nominated through an ideological prism by a President who has admitted he wants to appoint Justices in the mold of Scalia and Thomas. To those who say ideology does not matter, they should take their quarrel to President Bush.
I began to argue that consideration of a nominee’s judicial ideology was crucial 4 years ago. Then I was almost alone. Today, there is a growing and gathering consensus on the left and on the right that these questions are legitimate, important, and awfully crucial. Therefore, I and others, on both sides of the aisle, will ask you about your views.
Here is what the American people need to know beyond your resume. They need to know who you are and how you think. They need to assess not only the sharpness of your mind but the fullness of your heart. They need to believe that an overachiever can identify with an underdog who has nothing but the Constitution on his side. They need to understand that your first-class education and your advantaged life will not blind you to the plight of those who need help and who rely on the protections of the Constitution, which is every one of us at one point or another. They need to be confident that your claim of judicial modesty is more than easy rhetoric, that your praise of legal stability is more than lip service. They need to know above all that if you take the stewardship of the High Court, you will not steer it so far out of the mainstream that it founders in the shallow waters of extremist ideology.

39
As far as your own views go, however, we only have scratched the surface. In a sense, we have seen maybe 10 percent of you, just the visible tip of the iceberg, not the 90 percent that is still submerged. And we all know that it is the ice beneath the surface that can sink the ship.
For this reason, it is our obligation to ask and your obligation to answer questions about your judicial philosophy and legal ideology. If you cannot answer these questions, how are we to determine whether you are in the mainstream? A simple resume, no matter how distinguished, cannot answer that question. So for me, the first criterion upon which I will base my vote is whether you will answer questions fully and forthrightly. We do not want to trick you, badger you, or play a game of ‘‘gotcha.’’ That is why I met with you privately three times, and that is why I gave you a list of questions in advance of these hearings. It is not enough to say you will be fair. If that were enough, we would have no need for a hearing. I have no doubt you believe you will be a fair judge. I have no doubt that Justice Scalia thinks he is a fair judge and that Justice Ginsburg thinks she is a fair judge. But in case after case, they rule differently. They approach the Constitution differently, and they affect the lives of 280 million Americans differently. That is so, even though both Scalia and Ginsburg believe that they are fair.
You should be prepared to explain your views of the First Amendment and civil rights and environmental rights, religious liberty, privacy, workers’ rights, women’s rights, and a host of other issues relevant to the most powerful lifetime post in the Nation.
Now, having established that ideology and judicial philosophy are important, what is the best way to go about questioning on these subjects? The best way, I believe, is through understanding your views about particular past cases, not future cases that haven’t been decided, but past, already decided cases. It is not the only way, but it the best and most straightforward way.
Some have argued that questioning a nominee about his or her personal views of the Constitution or about decided cases indicates prejudgment about a future case. It does nothing of the sort. Most nominees who have come before us, including Justice Ginsburg, whose precedent you often cite, have answered such questions. Contrary to popular mythology, when she was a nominee, Justice Ginsburg gave lengthy answers to scores of questions about constitutional law and decided cases, including individual autonomy, the First Amendment, criminal law, choice, discrimination, and gender equality. Although there were places she said she did not want to answer, she spoke about dozens of Supreme Court cases and often gave her unvarnished impressions, suggesting that some were problematic in their reasoning while others were eloquent in their vindication of important constitutional principles. And nominee after nominee, from Powell to Thomas to Breyer, answered numerous questions about decided cases, and no one ever questioned their fitness to hear cases on issues raised during confirmation hearings.
So I hope you will decide to answer questions about decided cases, which so many other nominees have done. If you refuse to talk about already decided cases, the burden, sir, is on you, one of

the most preeminent litigators in America, to figure out a way in plain English to help us determine whether you will be a conservative, but mainstream conservative, Chief Justice or an ideologue.
Let me be clear. I know you are a conservative. I do not expect your views to mirror mine. After all, President Bush won the election, and everyone understands that he will nominate conservatives to the Court. But while we certainly do not expect the Court to move to the left under the President, it should not move radically to the right.
You told me when we met that you were not an ideologue and you share my aversion to ideologues. Yet you have been embraced by some of the most extreme ideologues in America, like the leader of Operation Rescue. That gives rise to a question many are asking: What do they know about you that we do not?
Judge Roberts, if you want my vote, you need to meet two criteria: first, you need to answers questions fully so we can ascertain your judicial philosophy; and, second, once we have ascertained your philosophy, it must be clear that it is in the broad mainstream.
Judge Roberts, if you answer important questions forthrightly and convince me you are jurist in the broad mainstream, I will be able to vote for you, and I would like to be able to vote for you. But if you do not, I will not be able to vote for you.
Mr. Chairman, I have high hopes for these hearings. I want and the American people want a dignified, respectful hearing process, open, fair, thorough, aboveboard, one that brings not only dignity but, even more importantly, information about Judge Roberts’s views and ideology to the American people. I, along with all of America, look forward to hearing your testimony.

Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, let me also join in extending a warm welcome to you and your family for these hearings. As the 15th speaker in the order of seniority here, I recall the adage I learned when I first came to Washington that everything has been said, but not everyone has said it yet. And perhaps by the time this hearing is over this week, you will have a fuller appreciation than you do now for that. But, of course, you are a known quantity, so to speak, to this Committee and to this Senate, having been confirmed by unanimous consent just 2 short years ago. And I want to extend a compliment to you on your judicial service. You have served with distinction in your current capacity. While the importance of your nomination as Chief Justice of the United States cannot be overstated, it seems as though each new nomination to the Court brings an element of drama, somewhat akin to an election. Indeed, we have seen special interest groups raising money, running television advertisements, and even trying

to coerce you into stating your opinion on hot-button issues that are likely to come before you as a judge, as if this were an election.
But, of course, this is not an election, and no reasonable person expects you to make promises to politicians about how you are likely to rule on those issues when they come before the Court as a condition of confirmation.
Still, some in our country have lost sight of the proper role of an unelected judge where the people are sovereign and where Government enjoys no legitimacy except by consent of the governed. They see unelected judges primarily as policymakers and arbiters of every pressing social issue that might arise, with the authority to dictate to the people what they think is good for us.
Well, this ideal of the Supreme Court as a super-legislature to which we might turn to give us everything that is good and stop everything that is bad is not a view that I share, nor, for that matter, did those who wrote and ratified the Constitution. The Constitution does not guarantee everything that is good and prohibit everything that is bad, or it could have been written in two sentences. Rather, it guarantees some specific things, it prohibits some specific things, and leaves the rest to be sorted out through the democratic process.
Alexander Hamilton, as you know, wrote in the Federalist Papers, which argued for ratification of the Constitution, that the judicial branch, he predicted, would be known as the least dangerous branch. He believed that there is no liberty if the power of judging is not separated from the legislative and executive powers. Its sole purpose was to interpret and apply the laws of the land. Its role would be limited.
Regrettably, Justices have not always been faithful to this constitutional design. All we need to do is to look at the Supreme Court’s track record to see why abdicating our right of self-government to nine judges isolated behind a monumental marble edifice, far removed from the life experiences of the average American, is a bad idea.
For example, the Constitution says in part that the Federal Government shall not prohibit the free exercise of religion or abridge freedom of speech. Many Americans, including me, are concerned that the Supreme Court, by erecting extra-constitutional and contradictory judge-made standards in this area of the law, has effectively banned voluntary religious expression from much of our public life, turning what should be official neutrality into a policy of official hostility.
To be sure, the Court has been zealous in protecting the rights of those who express themselves or promote their products using violence or sex, but voluntary expression of one’s faith, never.
Likewise, many Americans, including me, are baffled that the Supreme Court recently saw fit to strike down the display of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky but uphold the constitutionality of a display in Texas, even while the Ten Commandments itself is prominently displayed in the chambers of the United States Supreme Court on its ceiling.
Many Americans, including me, wondered what to read into the Court’s recent dismissal of a suit seeking to deny school children the right to recite the pledge of allegiance because it contains the

words ‘‘One nation under God.’’ A majority of the Court refused to agree that the pledge was constitutional, leaving this time-honored tradition of school children across our Nation in legal limbo.
And, recently, the Court expanded the awesome power of Government to condemn private property beyond all previous bounds by reading the public use limitation on eminent domain right out of the Constitution. Justice O’Connor warned, ‘‘The specter of condemnation now hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.’’
On what legitimate basis can the Supreme Court uphold State laws on the death penalty in 1989, then strike them down in 2005, relying not on the written Constitution, which, of course, had not changed, but on foreign laws that no American has voted on, consented to, or may even be aware of? When in 2003 the Court decided Lawrence v. Texas, the Court overruled a 1986 decision on the constitutionality of State laws based on the collective moral judgment of those States about permissible sexual activity. What changed in that intervening time? Did the Constitution change? Well, no. Did the Justices change? Yes. But should that determine a different meaning of the Constitution? Are some judges merely imposing their personal preferences under the guise of constitutional interpretation? Indeed, this was the same case, as you know, Judge Roberts, that served as the cornerstone of the Massachusetts Supreme Court’s decision holding that State laws limiting marriage to a man and a woman amounted to illegal discrimination.
Let me close on an issue that several Senators have already mentioned today, and that is, your obligation to answer our questions. Of course, I share with all of my colleagues a desire and a curiosity, really, to know what you think about all sorts of issues. All of us are curious. But just because we are curious does not mean that our curiosity should be satisfied. You have no obligation to tell us how you will rule on any issue that might come before you if you are confirmed to the Supreme Court.
It boils down to a question of impartiality and fairness. One characteristic of good judges is that they keep an open mind until they hear the facts and hear the lawyers argue the case before them. If you pledge today to rule a certain way on an issue, how can parties to future cases possibly feel that they would ever have a fair day in court?
Justice Ginsburg, as we have heard already, one of the last Supreme Court Justices confirmed by the Senate, noted not too long ago, ‘‘In accord with longstanding norm, every member of the current Supreme Court declined to furnish such information. The line each Justice drew in response to pre-confirmation questioning is crucial to the health of the Federal judiciary.’’ And this has come to be known as ‘‘the Ginsburg standard,’’ although it has been the norm for all nominees who come before the Committee and before the Senate for confirmation.
Now, I know some of the members of the Committee will ask you questions that you cannot answer. They will try to entice you to abandon the rules of ethics and the long tradition described by Justice Ginsburg. But that should not concern you, Judge Roberts. Don’t take the bait. Do not head down that road, but do exactly

what every nominee of every Republican President and every Democratic President has done: decline to answer any question that you feel would compromise your ability to do your job. The vast majority of the Senate, I am convinced, will not punish you for doing so. Rather, I am convinced that the vast majority of the Senate will respect you for this decision because it will show you are a person of deep integrity and independence, unwilling to trade your ethics for a confirmation vote.
Again, let me say welcome to you again before the Committee, and thank you for your continued willingness to serve this great Nation.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. Senator Durbin?
STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
Senator DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, welcome to you and your family. Congratulations on your nomination. The Committee hearing began with the Chairman telling us that you had shared the wisdom of 47 individual Senators by visiting their office, some of them on several different occasions, and many people believe that that fact alone should earn you confirmation before the United States Senate. Twelve years ago, at the nomination hearing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, my friend, Illinois Senator Paul Simon, said something worth repeating. He said to the nominee, and I quote, ‘‘You face a much harsher judge . . . than this Committee and that is the judgment of history. And that judgment is likely to revolve around the question: Did she restrict freedom or did she expand it? ’’ I think Senator Simon put his finger on how the United States Senate should evaluate a nominee for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. Judge Roberts, if you are confirmed to be the first Supreme Court Justice in the 21st century, the basic question is this: Will you restrict the personal freedoms we enjoy as Americans, or will you expand them? When we met in my office many weeks ago, I gave you a biography of a judge I admire greatly. His name was Frank Johnson, a Federal district judge from Alabama and a lifelong Republican. Fifty years ago, following the arrest of Rosa Parks, Judge Johnson ruled that African-Americans in Montgomery, Alabama, were acting within their constitutional rights when they organized a boycott of the buses, and he later ruled that Martin Luther King, Jr., and others could march from Selma to Montgomery. As a result of those decisions, the Ku Klux Klan branded Johnson the most hated man in America. Wooden crosses were burned on his lawn. He received so many death threats that his family was under constant Federal protection from 1961 to 1975. Judge Frank Johnson was denounced as a judicial activist and threatened with impeachment. He had the courage to expand freedom in America. Judge Roberts, I hope that you agree America must never return to those days of discrimination and limitations on our freedom.

Now, some of the memos you wrote—that I talked to you about in my office—many, many years ago in the Reagan administration have raised some serious concerns about where you stand on civil rights and women’s rights, concerns that have led some of the most respected civil rights groups in America to openly oppose your nomination.
So it is important for you at this hearing to answer the questions and to tell us your views on civil rights and equality and the role of courts in protecting these basic freedoms. This hearing is your opportunity to clarify the record, to explain your views. We cannot assume that time or maturity has changed your thinking from those Reagan-era memos. The refusal of the White House to disclose documents on 16 specific cases you worked on as Deputy Solicitor General denies this Committee more contemporary expressions of your values. Only your testimony before this Committee can convince us that John Roberts of 2005 will be a truly impartial and open-minded Chief Justice.
Concerns have also been raised about some of the things you wrote relative to the right of privacy. We have gone through Griswold, we know what that Supreme Court decision meant in 1965, 40 years ago, when the Court struck down the Connecticut statute which made it a crime for married couples to buy and use birth control. They said there was a fundamental right of privacy in that Constitution, though you can search every word of it and not find the word ‘‘privacy.’’ But it is far from settled law in the minds of many. Forty years later, there have been new efforts to restrict the right of privacy—attempts to impose gag rules on doctors when they speak to their patients about family planning. You saw it in the sad debate over the tragedy of Terri Schiavo, a debate that led some members of Congress to threaten judges who disagreed with their point of view with impeachment. And you can find it in the eagerness to authorize the Government to pry into our financial records, medical records, and library records.
Whether the Court continues to recognize and protect America’s right to privacy will have a profound impact on every American from birth to death. In your early writings, that we have to rely on here, you referred to this right of privacy as ‘‘an abstraction.’’ We need to know if that is what you believe.
We also need to hear your views on another basic issue, and that is executive power. They do not teach this subject much in law school. It is not tested on any bar exam. It has not been a major focus in many Supreme Court hearings. Yet it is very important today.
Some aspects of your early record when you were an attorney for a President, suggest you might be overly deferential to the executive branch. We need to know where you stand. Throughout history during times of war, Presidents have tried to restrict liberty in the name of security. The Supreme Court has always been the guardian of our Constitution. It has usually been up to the task, but sometimes it has failed—such as in the notorious Korematsu decision.
We are being tested again. Will we stand by our Constitution in this age of terrorism? That challenge will fall especially on our Supreme Court and on you, Judge Roberts, if you are confirmed.

45
We also need to know what you think about religious liberty. Over the past few decades, the Supreme Court has maintained a delicate yet, what I believe, proper balance between church and state. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor said it so well in the recent Ten Commandments decision, and I quote: ‘‘At a time when we see around the world the violent consequences of the assumption of religious authority by government, Americans may count themselves fortunate: Our regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from similar travails, while allowing private religious exercise to flourish. . . . Those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must therefore answer a difficult question: Why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served others so poorly? ’’
I asked you a question when you came by to see me, which I am not sure either one of us could answer at that moment. I asked you who has the burden of proof at this hearing. Do you have the burden to prove that you are a person worthy of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, or do we have the burden to prove that President Bush was wrong in selecting you? Your position as Supreme Court Chief Justice gives you extraordinary power to appoint 11 judges on the FISA court, which has the authority to issue warrants for searches and wiretaps of American citizens, all the way to the establishment of rules of criminal and civil procedure. No one has the right to sit on that court. No one has the right to be Chief Justice. But they can earn it through a hearing such as the one which we have today.
I spoke earlier about the courage of Frank Johnson. A few months ago, another judge of rare courage testified before this Committee. Her name is Joan Lefkow. She is a Federal judge in Chicago, and I was honored to recommend her. Last February, her husband and mother were murdered in her home by a deranged man who was angry that she had dismissed his lawsuit. In her remarks to the Committee, Judge Lefkow said that the murders of her family members were ‘‘a direct result of a decision made in the course of fulfilling our duty to do justice without fear or favor.’’ In my view, that is the only proper test for a Supreme Court justice. Will he do justice without fear or favor? Will he expand freedom for all Americans, as Judge Frank Johnson, the condemned judicial activist, once did?
I congratulate you, Judge Roberts, on your nomination and on your accomplished career. I look forward to these hearings to give you your chance in the next several days not to rely on 20-yearold memos or innuendos and statements by those who are not part of the hearing, but in your own words, a chance to tell us and to tell the American people what you truly believe. If you believe that you have the burden at this hearing to establish why you are worthy of this, the highest-ranking position of a judge in America, I hope that you will be forthcoming. If you do not answer the questions, if you hold back, if you believe, as some on the other side have suggested, that you have no responsibility to answer these questions, I am afraid that the results will not be as positive. I certainly hope that they will be positive.
Thank you.

[The prepared statement of Senator Durbin appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Durbin. I recognize now Senator Brownback, and also recognize today is his birthday.
STATEMENT OF HON. SAM BROWNBACK, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS
Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. This is certainly a long way to spend it. It is seeming like a long birthday. Judge Roberts, as one of my colleagues was just saying, I hope we are done before my birthday ends.
I welcome you to the Court, delighted to have you and your family here. I want to congratulate you on your lifetime of service thus far, and I look forward to future service that you will have for this great land.
I recall the enjoyable meeting that you and I had in my office, as many of the members here have had as well. You said two things in our meeting that I particularly took away and hung on to as an indicator of how you would look at the courts and also what America needs from our courts. One of the statements was that we need a more modest Court. And I looked at that and I thought, that is exactly the way the American people would look at the situation today. We need a more modest Court—a Court that is a court, and not a super-legislature. That looks at the Constitution as it is, not as we wish it might be, but as it is, so that we can be a rule-of-law Nation.
You had a second point that was very apt, I thought, when you talked about the courts and baseball. The analogy you draw, I found very appealing. You said it is a bad thing when the umpire is the most watched person on the field. In today’s American governance, the legislature can pass a bill, and the Executive can sign it, but then everybody holds their breath, waiting to see how the Court is going to look at this and how it is going to interpret it. It seems as if the Court is the real mover of what the actual law is. And that is a bad thing. The umpire should call the ball fair or foul, it is in or it is out, but not become actively involved as a player on the field. Unfortunately, we have reached a point where, in many respects, the judiciary is the most active policy player on the field.
I was struck by your statement when you originally were nominated, that you had ‘‘a profound appreciation for the role of the Court in our constitutional democracy.’’ That is something I think we all respect and we look for in what we need to do.
Democracy, I believe, loses its luster when Justices on the High Court—who are unelected and not directly accountable—invent constitutional rights and alter the balance of governmental powers in ways that find no support in the text, the structure, or the history of the Constitution. Unfortunately, the Court in recent years, I believe, has gone into that terrain.
In our system of government, the Constitution contemplates that Federal courts will exercise limited jurisdiction. They should neither write nor execute the laws, but simply ‘‘say what the law is,’’ as Chief Justice Marshall said in Marbury v. Madison. The narrow

scope of judicial power was the reason the people accepted the idea that the Federal courts could have the power of judicial review; that is, the ability to decide whether a challenged law comports with the Constitution. The people believed that the courts would maintain their independence and, at the same time, would recognize their role by deferring to the political branches on policy choices.
Legitimacy based on judicial restraint was a concept perhaps best expressed by Justice Felix Frankfurter, appointed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He said this: Courts are not representative bodies. They are not designed to be a good reflex of a democratic society. Their judgment is best informed, and therefore most dependable, within narrow limits. Their essential quality is detachment founded on independence. History teaches us that the independence of the judiciary is jeopardized when courts become embroiled in the passions of the day and assume primary responsibility in choosing between competing political, economic, and social pressures. Primary responsibility for adjusting the interests which compete of necessity belongs to the Congress.
Yet courts today have strayed far beyond this limited role. Constitutionalists from Hamilton to Frankfurter surely would be shocked at the broad sweep of judicial activity today. Federal courts are redefining the meaning of marriage, deciding when a human life is worthy of protection, running prisons and schools by decree, removing expressions of faith from the public square, permitting the Government, under the Takings Clause, to confiscate property from one person and give it to another in the name of private economic development, and then interpreting our American Constitution on the basis of foreign and international law.
Perhaps the Supreme Court’s most notorious exercise of raw political power came in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, two 1973 cases based on false statements which invented a constitutional right to abortion. The issue had been handled by the people through their elected representatives prior to that time. Since that decision, nearly 40 million children have been aborted in America. Forty million lives that could be amongst us, but are not. Beautiful innocent faces that could bless our existence, our families, and our Nation, creating and expanding a culture of life.
If you are confirmed, your Court will decide if there is a constitutional right to partially deliver a late-term child and then destroy it. Partial-birth abortion is making its way to the Supreme Court. The Federal courts have thus far found laws limiting partial-birth abortion unconstitutional.
Now, it should be noted again, if Roe is overturned, it does not ban abortion in America. It merely returns the issue to the States, so States like Kansas or California can set the standards they see right and just. Although the principle of stare decisis will be involved, I would note that the Supreme Court frequently has overruled prior precedents. A case founded in my State, Brown v. Board of Education, which overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, fits within a broad pattern of revising previous decisions since the founding. I would note for you that, by some measures, the Supreme Court has overruled itself in 174 cases, with a substantial majority of those cases involving constitutional, not statutory, issues.

One final thought. In a just and healthy society, both righteousness and justice travel together. Righteousness is the knowledge of right from wrong, good from evil, and that is something that is written on our hearts. Justice is the application of that knowledge.
Everybody in our representative form of Government tries to do both of these, righteousness and justice, within the boundaries set for each of us. No one branch has unlimited control. The Supreme Court has boundaries, too. There are checks and balances on what it can deal with and what it can do. For instance, the Court cannot appropriate money. That power is specifically left to the Congress in the Constitution, no matter how right or just the Court may view the cause.
We all are constitutional officers, sworn to uphold the Constitution. Yet each branch has separate functions, which the other branch can check and balance. The total system functions best when each branch does its job but not the other’s.
We have arrived at an important moment with your nomination to serve as Chief Justice of the United States, that is quite a title. Will you serve, as Hamilton assured the people, by exercising judgment rather than will? My review of your many legal writings over the past quarter-century leads me to believe that this is the case. I hope that this instinct will be proven correct during the days to come, that you, Judge Roberts, will be confirmed to serve as the first Justice among equals and that the noble legacy of the Justice that you once served will be honored.
God bless you and your family. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Brownback. Senator Coburn?
STATEMENT OF HON. TOM COBURN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA
Senator COBURN. Thank you, Senator. First of all, I would like to thank you and your staff, as well as all the staff of this Committee. While we were traveling in August, they were laboring diligently to help prepare us for these hearings.
I also think everybody should know that Senator Brownback is entering his fifth decade, so he can catch up with the rest of us.
And finally, I am somewhat amused at the propensity for us to project your life expectancy. I met with you twice, and as the only physician on this panel and one of the few non-lawyers on this panel, I find it somewhat amusing that we can predict that without a history, a physical exam, or a family history. But we will let that pass.
I am a physician, and up until the end of this month and, hopefully, after that, I will continue to practice. This weekend I had the great fortune of delivering two little girls. And I have had the opportunity to talk with people from all walks of life as a physician— those that have nothing and those that have everything. And I believe the people in our country, and in my State in particular, are interested and concerned with two main issues. One is this word of judicial activism that means such a different thing to so many different people. And the second is the polarization that has resulted from it, and the division that occurred in our country that separates us and divides us at a time when we need to be together.

We each have our own definition of judicial activism. Essentially, the Court will not become an activist court if it adheres to its appropriate role and does not attempt to legislate or create policy. There always will be and should always be checks on each of the different branches of Government. Yet look where we are today. Decades of judicial activism have created these huge rifts in the social fabric of our country. Whether we are on one side or the other, it is a tension pulling us apart rather than a tension pulling us together.
I believe we have seen Federal and State legislators’ responsibility usurped by the Court, especially to make important decisions, and I think that is what has created a lot of the division within our country. And I believe it is time that that stop, and a limited role for the Supreme Court. I think we are willing to debate as a country what judicial activism is, but we are also wanting someone who will listen to both sides of that and, in a measured and balanced way, knowing what the Constitution says and the restraint that our forefathers have written about, will take that into consideration.
I am deeply heartened in that I have read many statements that you have made, where you indicate a more proper role for that of the judiciary, and I believe in our discussion, a super-legislator body is not what the Court was intended to be.
When I ponder our country and its greatness, its weaknesses, its potential, my heart aches for less divisiveness, less polarization, less finger pointing, less bitterness, less mindless partisanship, which at times sounds almost hateful to the ear of Americans. The problems before our country are enormous. Our family structures have declined. Our dependency on Government has grown. The very heritage of our country, which was born out of sacrifice by those who preceded us is at risk. We are all Americans. We all want the greatest future for the generations to come, protection for the innocent and the frail, support for those less fortunate. But most of all we want an America that will live on as a beacon of hope, freedom, kindness and opportunity.
America is an idea. It is not competing ideologies. It is an idea that has proven tremendously successful, and when we reduce it to that of competing ideologies, we make it less than what it is. I believe the genius of our Founders is that they recognized that individual rights were derived from a creator, not a king, not a court, not a legislature or a state. Our Founders were concerned that if our rights derived from the state or a court, they could be taken away by a state or a court. Our Constitution enshrines this idea and gives its meaning in the rule of law. That is why it is important for us to respect the words of that Constitution.
I would hope, as we conduct these hearings over the next few days, our tendency as politicians to be insensitive, bitter, discourteous and political, will surrender to the higher values that define us as a Nation. We have an opportunity to lead by example, to restore the values and principles that bind us together. How we conduct ourselves and how we treat you, Judge Roberts, can be a great start towards reconciliation in our country.
I want one America. An America that continues to be divided is an America that is at risk. Our country waits for its leaders at all

levels to rise to the occasion of rebuilding our future by placing our political fortunes last and constitutional principles first, and working diligently to reconcile each and every American to the freedom and responsibility that our republic demands.
May God bless our efforts. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. We now move to the presenters, Senator Lugar, Senator Bayh and Senator Warner, and then the administration of the oath to Judge Roberts, and then Judge Roberts’s opening statement. Welcome, Senator Lugar, as the senior presenter, elected in 1976, Indiana’s senior Senator. We have allotted 5 minutes each to the presenters, and Senator Lugar, you are now recognized.
PRESENTATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES, BY HON. RICHARD G. LUGAR, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA
Senator LUGAR. Mr. Chairman, let me first ask that a copy of my full statement appear in the Committee record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, your full statement will be made a part of the record.
Senator LUGAR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a genuine privilege and pleasure to appear before you, Senator Leahy, and my other distinguished colleagues who serve on this important Committee.
I am pleased to introduce the President’s nominee to serve as the 109th Justice of the Supreme Court and the 17th Chief Justice of the United States, John G. Roberts, Jr.
Judge Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, but moved at age 8 to Indiana. The Roberts’s family settled in Long Beach, a small Hoosier community on the shores of Lake Michigan. John attended local schools there in nearby LaPorte, and in 1973 was graduated first in his high school class of 22, having also excelled in numerous extracurricular activities, including co-captaining the football team, despite his self-described status as a slow-footed halfback.
I know Committee Members will understand my observing that our State takes a certain pride of its own nomination by the President to lead the Nation’s highest court. Simply put, John Roberts is a brilliant lawyer, a jurist with an extraordinary record of accomplishments in public service. This exceptional blend of professional and personal qualifications is especially important now, given the further responsibilities Judge Roberts has been called upon to assume on the passing of the Chief Justice.
I know Judge Roberts is keenly and humbly aware of the large shoes he has now been asked to fill, the more so since the late Chief Justice was his own initial boss when he arrived in Washington a quarter century ago. All Americans can be grateful that Judge Roberts not only learned, but has lived the lessons taught by his mentor and his role model. In my judgment, he is extremely qualified to carry forward the tradition of fair, principled and collegial leadership that so distinguished the man for whom he once worked, and has now been nominated to replace.
Under the judicial confirmation standards that prevail throughout most of our history, my remarks could appropriately end at this point, and the Committee and the Senate as a whole could proceed

to consider Judge Roberts’s nomination in light of his outstanding qualifications. Indeed, nominees almost never testified in such hearings before 1955, and the last Supreme Court Justice from Indiana, Sherman Minton, was confirmed without controversy, despite declining even to appear before the Committee, following his nomination by President Truman.
I am not troubled by the fact that the Committee hearings, including testimony by Supreme Court nominees now seems firmly established as part of the confirmation process. These proceedings serve a vital role in our deliberations and are a vivid course in living history for all Americans. But it is important we write that history well.
Today’s Supreme Court regularly faces issues of enormous public import and attendant controversy. Many are deeply divisive with well-funded, well-organized advocacy groups passionately committed to one or the other side, and for whom the central exclusive focus is who wins. Media coverage and the information age, whether on talk radio or countless cable outlets, featuring talking heads for each side, fuels both the controversy and the resultant tendency to see the Supreme Court as a kind of political branch of last resort. When a Court vacancy occurs, the confirmation process takes on the trappings of a political campaign, replete with interest group television ads that often reflect the same oversimplifications and distortions that are disturbing even in campaign for offices that are in fact political.
All of this may be understandable. It remains, in my view, a fundamental departure from the vision of the courts and their proper role than animated those who crafted our Constitution. The Founders were at pains to emphasize the difference between the political branches, the executive and legislative and the judiciary. Their concern about the potential dangers of passionate, interest-driven political divisions, which Madison famously called the ‘‘Mischiefs of Faction,’’ influenced their design of our entire governmental structure, but they were especially concerned that such mischiefs not permeate those who would sit on the bench. Otherwise, they warned, the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice, and would stifle the voice both of law and of equity.
I believe that each of us in the Senate bears a special responsibility to prevent that from occurring. The primary focus of these hearings and our subsequent debate and vote on the floor will be Judge Roberts and his qualifications. But another focus will be whether the Senate, in discharging this solemn advice as a consent duty conferred by the Constitution, is faithful to the trust the Founders placed in us.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and all Members of the Committee for your courtesy in allowing me to introduce Judge John G. Roberts, Jr., a distinguished son of Indiana, who I believe will prove to be an outstanding Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
I thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Senator Lugar appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Lugar.

We now turn to Senator Bayh, elected in 1998, previously Governor of Indiana. Senator Bayh.
PRESENTATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES, BY HON. EVAN BAYH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA
Senator BAYH. Thank you very much, Chairman Specter, Senator Leahy, members of the Judiciary Committee.
There is not nearly enough civility in Washington today, so when I was asked to uphold longstanding and bipartisan tradition to introduce someone from my State, I did not hesitate to accept.
I am pleased to join with my friends and our colleagues, Dick Lugar and John Warner, to introduce to you, John Roberts.
John Roberts grew up in northwest Indiana and still has family living in our State. He is the proud father of two lovely children, Jack and Josie, and the husband of Jane.
At only 50, Judge Roberts has had a distinguished legal career that would make most lawyers envious. He has argued 39 cases before our Supreme Court, and won 25 of them. Most lawyers are lucky to argue and win one case before our Nation’s highest Court. There is no question that Judge Roberts has achieved much through hard work and great ability to reach the pinnacle of the legal profession.
If confirmed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Roberts could serve for 30 or more years. During that time, the Court will likely hear cases that affect every aspect of the law and American life, from civil rights, to women’s rights, to property rights, to States’ rights. I look forward to a full and clarifying discussion of his views on these important topics and others, because for this nominee and for anyone who aspires to our Nation’s highest Court, it is ultimately their beliefs, even more than their biography, which determine the result of the confirmation process.
As a fellow Hoosier, I am proud that someone from our State would be so talented and so successful to be considered for a position on the highest Court of our land.
Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, my colleagues, I am pleased to introduce to you a fellow Hoosier, Judge John Roberts.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Bayh. Senator Warner, welcome back. When you were here earlier this morning I said you would be recognized at about 3:20. I want to apologize for being two minutes off. Senator WARNER. It is almost, Mr. Chairman. I will take till 3:10 to finish my statement if you yield back your time to me. Chairman SPECTER.

Senator WARNER. Members of the Committee and Judge Roberts and his family, I find this a singular privilege in my now 27 years in this institution.
Speaking of institutions, in 218 years since the Constitution was ratified, we have had 43 Presidents and this is the 17th Chief Jus-

tice. It seems to me that underscores the importance of this hearing. Further, the Senate deliberations in this hearing, followed by subsequent floor debate, provide a unique opportunity for generations of Americans, particularly the younger Americans, to acquaint themselves with how our Government operates.
I am absolutely confident that this distinguished Committee, before whom I have appeared many, many times in these years, will comport yourselves in a manner in the finest traditions of the Senate, and will impart in our audience across America, particularly the younger ones, a respect for and an understanding of the institution of the United States Senate and its responsibilities.
The Constitution, together with the Bill of Rights, is an amazing document, for it is the reason that our Nation’s Government stands today as the oldest continuous democratic republic form of government in the world today. Indeed, most all of the other bold experiments in Government have gone into the dust bin of history. Little wonder why so many other nations are forming their governments today, patterning their government on ours.
But only of the President and the Senate fairly, objectively and in a timely manner, exercise these respective constitutional powers, can the judicial branch have the numbers of qualified judges to properly serve the needs of our citizens. For this reason, in my view, a Senator has no higher duty than his or her responsibilities under Article II, Section II.
Recently 14 Senators, of which I was one, committed ourselves in writing to support the Senate leadership in facilitating the Senate’s responsibility of providing advice and consent. In our memorandum of understanding, Senator Byrd and I incorporated language that spoke directly to the Founding Fathers’ explicit use of the word ‘‘advice.’’ Without question our framers put the word ‘‘advice’’ in the Constitution for a reason, to ensure consultation between a President and the Senate prior to the forwarding of a nominee to the Senate for consideration. I commend President Bush for the exemplary manner in which he conducted the advice and consent responsibility.
Now, with the beginning of these hearings, the Senate commences the next phase, the consent phase of this constitutional process. After the Committee consideration, the nomination will move to the full Senate for debate, followed by a vote. Throughout this process, the ultimate question will remain the same, whether the Senate should grant, or deny, consent.
Now to this distinguished jurist. I judge his credentials to be Chief Justice in the same manner as I have applied to all others since I have been privileged to serve in this institution. I recounted there are about over 2,000 nominations that have come in this quarter of a century plus. I can say without equivocation, I have never seen the credentials of any nominee with stronger qualifications than Judge Roberts.
Some 2 years ago, when nominated to serve in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, I was privileged, at his request, to introduce him. At the time he was relatively unknown. Today the world knows him.
We were brought together because we were both fortunate to have been partners at different times in our careers at the law firm

of Hogan & Hartson, a venerable firm known for its integrity and rigid adherence to ethics. Among the firm’s many salutary credentials, it has been long known for its pro bono work.
In fact, I will share a personal story. In 1960, I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney—been there about 4 years. A knock came on my door, and in walked a very tall, erect man, introducing himself as having just been appointed to represent an indigent defendant charged with first degree murder. We had a brief consultation. The trial followed. Midway in the trial the defendant pleaded guilty to a lesser offense. That man was Nelson D. Hartson, Senior Partner and Founder of this firm.
I firmly believe that John Roberts shares in the belief that lawyers have an ethical duty to give back to the community by providing free legal services, particularly to those in need. The hundreds and hundreds of hours he spent working on pro bono cases are a testament to that. He did not have to do any of it. The bar does not require it, but he did it out of the graciousness of his heart and obligation.
Those who know him best can also attest to the kind of person he is. Throughout his legal career, both in public and private practice, in his pro bono work, Roberts has worked with and against hundreds of lawyers. Those attorneys who know him well typically speak with one voice when they tell you that dignity, humility and a sense of fairness are the hallmarks of this nominee.
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I take a moment to remind all present, and those listening and following, that this exact week 218 years ago, our Founding Fathers finished the final draft of the U.S. Constitution, after a long hot summer of drafting and debating. And when Ben Franklin ultimately emerged from Independence Hall upon the conclusion of the Convention, a reporter asked him, ‘‘Mr. Franklin, sir, what have you wrought? ’’ And he said, ‘‘A republic, if you can keep it.’’ And that is ultimately what this advice and consent process is all about.
But while the Constitution sets the course of our Nation, it is without question the Chief Justice of the United States who must have his hand firmly on the tiller to keep our great ship of state on a course consistent with the Constitution.
I shall follow carefully the deliberations of this Committee. I will participate in the floor debate. I look forward to the privilege of voting for this fine outstanding public servant.
Judge Roberts, I am the last. You are on your own. [Laughter.] [The prepared statement of Senator Warner appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Warner. Thank you, Senator Lugar. Thank you, Senator Bayh. Judge Roberts, if you will now resume your position at center stage. Judge Roberts, if you would now stand, please. The protocol calls for your swearing in at this point. We have 23 photographers in the well, 5 more waiting. We may revise our procedures to swear you in at the start of the proceeding if you should come back. If you would raise your right hand. They have asked me to do this slowly because this is their one photo op.

Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before this Committee on the Judiciary of the United States Senate will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
Judge ROBERTS. I do. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you. You may be seated. Judge Roberts, we compliment you on your patience in listening to 21 speeches, and the floor is now yours.
STATEMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., NOMINEE TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES
Judge ROBERTS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and Senator Leahy, and members of the Committee.
Let me begin by thanking Senators Lugar and Warner and Bayh for their warm and generous introductions.
And let me reiterate my thanks to the President for nominating me. I am humbled by his confidence, and if confirmed, I will do everything I can to be worthy of the high trust he has placed in me.
Let me also thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the members of the Committee for the many courtesies you have extended to me and my family over the past eight weeks. I am particularly grateful that members have been so accommodating in meeting with me personally. I have found those meetings very useful in better understanding the concerns of the Committee as the Committee undertakes its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.
I know that I would not be here today were it not for the sacrifices and help over the years of my family, who you met earlier today, friends, mentors, teachers and colleagues, many of whom are here today.
Last week one of those mentors and friends, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was laid to rest. I talked last week with the nurses who helped care for him over the past year, and I was glad to hear from them that he was not a particularly good patient.
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. He chafed at the limitations they tried to impose. His dedication to duty over the past year was an inspiration to me and I know to many others. I will miss him. My personal appreciation that I owe a great debt to others reinforces my view that a certain humility should characterize the judicial role. Judges and Justices are servants of the law, not the other way around. Judges are like umpires. Umpires don’t make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire. Judges have to have the humility to recognize that they operate within a system of precedent shaped by other judges equally striving to live up to the judicial oath, and judges have to have the modesty to be open in the decisional process to the considered views of their colleagues on the bench. Mr. Chairman, when I worked in the Department of Justice in the Office of the Solicitor General, it was my job to argue cases for the United States before the Supreme Court. I always found it very moving to stand before the Justices and say, ‘‘I speak for my country.’’ But it was after I left the Department and began arguing

cases against the United States, that I fully appreciated the importance of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system. Here was the United States, the most powerful entity in the world, aligned against my client, and yet all I had to do was convince the Court that I was right on the law, and the Government was wrong, and all that power and might would recede in deference to the rule of law.
That is a remarkable thing. It is what we mean when we say that we are a Government of laws and not of men. It is that rule of law that protects the rights and liberties of all Americans. It is the envy of the world, because without the rule of law, any rights are meaningless.
President Ronald Reagan used to speak of the Soviet Constitution, and he noted that it purported to grant wonderful rights of all sorts to people, but those rights were empty promises because that system did not have an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law and enforce those rights. We do, because of the wisdom of our Founders and the sacrifices of our heroes over the generations to make their vision a reality.
Mr. Chairman, I come before the Committee with no agenda. I have no platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda, but I do have a commitment. If I am confirmed, I will confront every case with an open mind. I will fully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented. I will be open to the considered views of my colleagues on the bench, and I will decide every case based on the record, according to the rule of law, without fear or favor, to the best of my ability, and I will remember that it’s my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.
Senators Lugar and Bayh talked of my boyhood back in Indiana. I think all of us retain from the days of our youth certain enduring images. For me those images are of the endless fields of Indiana, stretching to the horizon, punctuated only by an isolated silo or a barn. And as I grew older, those endless fields came to represent for me the limitless possibilities of our great land.
Growing up, I never imagined that I would be here in this historic room, nominated to be the Chief Justice. But now that I am here, I recall those endless fields with their promise of infinite possibilities, and that memory inspires in me a very profound commitment. If I am confirmed, I will be vigilant to protect the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court, and I will work to ensure that it upholds the rule of law and safeguards those liberties that make this land one of endless possibilities for all Americans.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members of the Committee. I look forward to your questions.

NOMINATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., OF MARYLAND, TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2005
UNITED STATES SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in room SH–216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman SPECTER. It is 9:30. The confirmation hearing of Judge Roberts will now proceed. Welcome again, Judge Roberts. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. We begin the first round of questioning in order of seniority, with 30 minutes allotted to each Senator. Judge Roberts, there are many subjects of enormous importance that you will be asked about in this confirmation hearing, but I start with the central issue which perhaps concerns most Americans, and that is the issue of the woman’s right to choose and Roe v. Wade. And I begin collaterally with the issue of stare decisis and the issue of precedents. Black’s Law Dictionary defines stare decisis as ‘‘let the decision stand, to adhere to precedents and not to unsettle things which are established.’’ Justice Scalia articulated, ‘‘The principal purpose of stare decisis is to protect reliance interests and further stability in the law.’’ Justice Frankfurter articulated the principle, ‘‘We recognize that stare decisis embodies an important social policy. It represents an element of continuity in law and is rooted in the psychological need to satisfy reasonable expectations.’’ Justice Cardozo in a similar vein, ‘‘No judicial system could do society’s work if each issue had to be decided afresh in every case which raised it.’’ In our initial conversation, you talked about stability and humility in the law. Would you agree with those articulations of the principles of stare decisis as you had contemplated them, as you said you looked for stability in the law? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would. I would point out that the principle goes back even farther than Cardozo and Frank-

furter. Hamilton, in Federalist No. 78, said that, ‘‘To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the judges, they need to be bound down by rules and precedents.’’ So even that far back, the Founders appreciated the role of precedent in promoting evenhandedness, predictability, stability, the appearance of integrity in the judicial process.
Chairman SPECTER. I move now to Casey v. Planned Parenthood. Thirty minutes may seem like a long time and a second round of 20 minutes, but the time will fly, and I want to get right to the core of the issue.
In Casey, the key test on following precedents moved to the extent of reliance by the people on the precedent, and Casey had this to say in a rather earthy way: ‘‘People have ordered their thinking and living around Roe. To eliminate the issue of reliance, one would need to limit cognizable reliance to specific instances of sexual activity. For two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event contraception should fail.’’
That is the joint opinion, rather earthy in its context. Would you agree with that?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, the importance of settled expectations in the application of stare decisis is a very important consideration. That was emphasized in the Casey opinion, but also in other opinions outside that area of the law.
The principles of stare decisis look at a number of factors, settled expectations one of them, as you mentioned. Whether or not particular precedents have proven to be unworkable is another consideration on the other side; whether the doctrinal bases of a decision have been eroded by subsequent developments. For example, if you have a case in which there are three precedents that lead and support that result and in the intervening period two of them have been overruled, that may be a basis for reconsidering the prior precedent.
Chairman SPECTER. But there is no doctrinal basis erosion in Roe, is there, Judge Roberts?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I feel the need to stay away from a discussion of particular cases. I’m happy to discuss the principles of stare decisis, and the Court has developed a series of precedents on precedent, if you will. They have a number of cases talking about how this principle should be applied. And as you emphasized, in Casey they focused on settled expectations. They also looked at the workability and the erosion of precedents. The erosion of precedent I think figured more prominently in the Court’s discussion in the Lawrence case, for example, but it is one of the factors that is looked at on the other side of the balance.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, do you see any erosion of precedent as to Roe?
Judge ROBERTS. Again, I think I should stay away from discussions of particular issues that are likely to come before the Court again. And in the area of abortion, there are cases on the Court’s docket, of course. It is an issue that does come before the Court. So while I’m happy to talk about stare decisis and the importance of precedent, I don’t think I should get into the application of those principles in a particular area.

Chairman SPECTER. Well, Judge Roberts, I don’t know that we are dealing with any specific issue. When you mention—and you brought the term up—erosion of precedent, whether you see that as a factor in the application of stare decisis or expectations, for example, on the citation I quoted from Casey v. Planned Parenthood.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, in the particular case of Roe, obviously you had the Casey decision in ’92 or ’93.
Chairman SPECTER. ’92. Judge ROBERTS. ’92, in which they went through the various factors in stare decisis and reaffirmed the central holding in Roe while revisiting the trimester framework and substituting the undue burden analysis with strict scrutiny. So as of ’92, you had a reaffirmation of the central holding in Roe. That decision, that application of the principles of stare decisis is, of course, itself a precedent that would be entitled to respect under those principles. Chairman SPECTER. The joint opinion then goes on, after the statement as to sexual activity, to come to the core issue about women being able to plan their lives. The joint opinion says, ‘‘The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.’’ Do you agree with that statement, Judge Roberts? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator, as a general proposition. But I do feel compelled to point out that I should not, based on the precedent of prior nominees, agree or disagree with particular decisions, and I’m reluctant to do that. That’s one of the areas where I think prior nominees have drawn the line when it comes to do you agree with this case or do you agree with that case. That’s something that I’m going to have to draw the line in the— Chairman SPECTER. Well, I am not going to ask you whether you are going to vote to overrule Roe or sustain it, but we are talking here about the jurisprudence of the Court and their reasoning. Let me come to another key phase of Casey where the joint opinion says, ‘‘A terrible price would be paid for overruling Roe. It would seriously weaken the Court’s capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of the Nation dedicated to the rule of law.’’ Now, this moves away from the specific holding and goes to a much broader jurisprudential point, really raising the issue of whether there would be a recognition of the Court’s authority. And in a similar line, the Court said this: that to overrule Roe would be ‘‘a surrender to political pressure,’’ and added, ‘‘To overrule under fire would subvert the Court’s legitimacy.’’ So in these statements on Casey, you are really going beyond the holding. You are going to the legitimacy and authority of the Court. Do you agree with that? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I do think the considerations about the Court’s legitimacy are critically important. In other cases—I’m thinking of Payner v. Tennessee, for example—the Court has focused on extensive disagreement as a grounds in favor of reconsideration. In Casey, the Court looked at the disagreement as a factor in favor of reaffirming the decision. So it’s a factor that is played different ways in different precedents of the Court.

I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough—and the Court has emphasized this on several occasions. It is not enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongly decided. That really doesn’t answer the question. It just poses the question. And you do look at these other factors, like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the Court, like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent developments. All of those factors go into the determination of whether to revisit a precedent under the principles of stare decisis.
Chairman SPECTER. A jolt to the legal system, a movement against stability—one of the Roberts doctrines.
Judge ROBERTS. An overruling of a prior precedent is a jolt to the legal system. It is inconsistent with principles of stability and yet—
Chairman SPECTER. One—go ahead. Judge ROBERTS. I was just going to say, the principles of stare decisis recognize that there are situations when that’s a price that has to be paid. Obviously, Brown v. Board of Education is a leading example, overruling Plessy v. Ferguson, the West Coast Hotel case overruling the Lochner era decisions. Those were to a certain extent jolts to the legal system, and the arguments against them had a lot to do with stability and predictability. But the other arguments—that intervening precedents had eroded the authority of those cases, that those precedents that were overruled had proved unworkable—carried the day in those cases. Chairman SPECTER. One final citation from the joint opinion in Roe: ‘‘After nearly 20 years of litigation in Roe’s wake, we are satisfied that the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe’s resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding.’’ Do you think the joint opinion is correct in elevating precedential force even above the specific holding of the case? Judge ROBERTS. That is the general approach when you’re considering stare decisis. It’s the notion that it’s not enough that you might think that the precedent is flawed, that there are other considerations that enter into the calculus that have to be taken into account, the values of respect for precedent, evenhandedness, predictability, stability; the considerations on the other side, whether a precedent you think may be flawed is workable or not workable, whether it’s been eroded. So to the extent that the statement is making the basic point that it’s not enough that you might think the precedent is flawed to justify revisiting it, I do agree with that. Chairman SPECTER. When you and I met on our first so-called courtesy call, I discussed with you the concept of a super-stare decisis. And this was a phrase used by Circuit Judge Luttig in Richmond Medical Center v. Governor Gilmore in the year 2000, when he refers to Casey being a super-stare decisis decision with respect to the fundamental right to choose, and a number of the academics—Professor Farber has talked about super-stare decisis, and Professor Estrich has, as it applies to statutory lines. Do you think that the cases which have followed Roe fall into the category of a super-stare decisis designation?

Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s a term that hasn’t found its way into the Supreme Court opinions yet. I think—
Chairman SPECTER. Well, there is an opportunity for that. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I think one way to look at it is that the Casey decision itself, which applied the principles of stare decisis to Roe v. Wade, is itself a precedent of the Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. And that would be the body of law that any judge confronting an issue in his care would begin with, not simply the decision in Roe v. Wade but its reaffirmation in the Casey decision. That is itself a precedent. It’s a precedent on whether or not to revisit the Roe v. Wade precedent. And under principles of stare decisis, that would be where any judge considering the issue in this area would begin. Chairman SPECTER. When you and I talked informally, I asked you if you had any thought as to how many opportunities there were in the intervening 32 years for Roe to be overruled, and you said you did not really know, and you cited a number. And I said, ‘‘Would it surprise you to know that there have been 38 occasions where Roe has been taken up, not with a specific issue raised but all with an opportunity for Roe to be overruled?’’ One of them was Rust v. Sullivan, where you participated in the writing of the brief, and although the case did not squarely raise the overruling of Roe, it involved the issue of whether Planned Parenthood units funded with Federal money could counsel on abortion. And in that brief, you again raised the question about Roe being wrongly decided, and then I pointed out to you that there had been some 38 cases where the Court had taken up Roe. I am very seldom a user of charts, but on this one I prepared a chart because it speaks—a little too heavy to lift, but it speaks louder than just—thank you, Senator Grassley. Thirty-eight cases where Roe has been taken up, and I don’t want to coin any phrases on super precedents. We will leave that to the Supreme Court. But would you think that Roe might be a super-duper precedent in light— [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER.—of 38 occasions to overrule it? Judge ROBERTS. The interesting thing, of course, is not simply the opportunity to address it, but when the Court actually considers the question. And that, of course, is in the Casey decision where it did apply the principles of stare decisis and specifically addressed it. And that I think is the decision that any judge in this area would begin with. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Roberts, in your confirmation hearing for circuit court, your testimony read to this effect, and it has been widely quoted: ‘‘Roe is the settled law of the land.’’ Do you mean settled for you, settled only for your capacity as a circuit judge, or settled beyond that? Judge ROBERTS. Well, beyond that, it’s settled as a precedent of the Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. And those principles, applied in the Casey case, explain when cases should be revisited and when they should not. And it is settled as a precedent of the Court, yes.

Chairman SPECTER. You went on then to say, ‘‘It’s a little more than settled. It was reaffirmed in the face of a challenge that it should be overruled in the Casey decision.’’ So it has that added precedential value.
Judge ROBERTS. I think the initial question the judge confronting an issue in this area, you don’t go straight to the Roe decision; you begin with Casey, which modified the Roe framework and reaffirmed its central holding.
Chairman SPECTER. And you went on to say, ‘‘Accordingly, it is the settled law of the land,’’ using the term ‘‘settled’’ again. Then your final statement as to this quotation, ‘‘There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying the precedent as well as Casey.’’
There had been a question raised about your personal views, and let me digress from Roe for just a moment because I think this touches on an issue which ought to be settled. When you talk about your personal views, and as they may relate to your own faith, would you say that your views are the same as those expressed by John Kennedy when he was a candidate and he spoke to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association in September of 1960, ‘‘I do not speak for my church on public matters, and the church does not speak for me’’?
Judge ROBERTS. I agree with that, Senator, yes. Chairman SPECTER. And did you have that in mind when you said, ‘‘There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying the precedent as well as Casey’’? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think people’s personal views on this issue derive from a number of sources, and there’s nothing in my personal views based on faith or other sources that would prevent me from applying the precedents of the Court faithfully under principles of stare decisis. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Roberts, the change in positions have been frequently noted. Early on in one of your memoranda you had made a comment on the so-called right to privacy. This was a 1981 memo to Attorney General Smith, December 11, 1981. You were referring to a lecture which Solicitor General Griswold had given 6 years earlier, and you wrote, Solicitor General Griswold ‘‘devotes a section to the so-called ‘right to privacy,’ arguing as we have that such an amorphous right is not to be found in the Constitution.’’ Do you believe that the right to privacy—do you believe today that the right to privacy does exist in the Constitution? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I do. The right to privacy is protected under the Constitution in various ways. It’s protected by the Fourth Amendment, which provides that the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, effects and papers is protected. It’s protected under the First Amendment, dealing with prohibition on establishment of a religion and guarantee of free exercise, protects privacy in matters of conscience. It was protected by the Framers in areas that were of particular concern to them that may not seem so significant today, the Third Amendment, protecting their homes against the quartering of troops. And in addition, the Court has, with a series of decisions going back 80 years, has recognized that personal privacy is a component

147
of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. The Court has explained that the liberty protected is not limited to freedom from physical restraint, and that it’s protected not simply procedurally but as a substantive matter as well. And those decisions have sketched out over a period of 80 years certain aspects of privacy that are protected as part of the liberty in the Due Process Clause under the Constitution.
Chairman SPECTER. So that the views that you expressed back in 1981, raising an issue about ‘‘amorphous’’ and ‘‘so-called’’ would not be the views you would express today?
Judge ROBERTS. Those views reflected the Dean’s speech. If you read his speech, he’s quite skeptical of that right. I knew the Attorney General was, and I was transmitting the Dean’s speech to the Attorney General. But my views today are as I’ve just stated them.
Chairman SPECTER. So they were not necessarily your views then, but they certainly are not your views now.
Judge ROBERTS. I think that’s fair, yes. Chairman SPECTER. With respect to, going back again to the import of Roe and the passage of time, Supreme Court Chief Justice Rehnquist changed his views on Miranda in the 1974 case, Michigan v. Tucker, which I am sure you are familiar with. They did not apply Miranda, without going into the technical reasons there. But the issue came back to the Court in U.S. v. Dickerson in the year 2000, and the Chief Justice decided that Miranda should be upheld, and he used this language, that it became ‘‘so embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become a part of our National culture.’’ Do you think that that kind of a principle would be applicable to a woman’s right to choose as embodied in Roe v. Wade? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think those are some of the considerations the Court applied in Casey when it applied stare decisis to Roe, and those were certainly the considerations that the Chief Justice focused on in Dickerson. I doubt that his views of the underlying correctness of Miranda had changed, but it was a different question in Dickerson. It wasn’t whether Miranda was right, it was whether Miranda should be overruled at this stage, and the Chief applied and address that separate question distinct from any of his views on whether Miranda was correct or not when decided, and that’s the approach the Court follows under principles of stare decisis. Chairman SPECTER. Well, that is the analogy I am looking for in Roe v. Wade. He might disagree with it at the time it was decided, but then his language is very powerful when he talks about it becoming ‘‘embedded in routine police practices to the point where the warnings have become a part of our National culture.’’ The question, by analogy, whether a woman’s right to choose is so embedded that it has become a part of our National culture. What do you think? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think that gets to the application of the principles in a particular case, and based on my review of the prior transcripts of every nominee sitting on the Court today, that’s where they’ve generally declined to answer, when it gets to the application of legal principles to particular cases.

148
I would repeat that the Court has already applied the principles of stare decisis to Roe in the Casey decision, and that stands as a precedent of the Court as well.
Chairman SPECTER. So you are not bound to follow it, but it is pretty impressive logic?
Judge ROBERTS. In the Casey decision at— Chairman SPECTER. No, no. I am talking about Chief Justice Rehnquist on Miranda. Judge ROBERTS. I think in that case, the Chief’s explanation of why they weren’t going to revisit Miranda is—it persuaded, I believe, all but one member of the Court. And I’m sure it had added persuasive effect because of the Chief’s prior views on Miranda itself. It is a recognition of some of the things we’ve been talking about, the values of stare decisis. I don’t think, again, that there’s any doubt what the Chief, certainly what he thought. He told us what he thought about Miranda. I doubt that those views have changed, but there are other considerations that come into play when you’re asked to revisit a precedent of the Court, and those are the things we’ve talked about, and they’re laid out again in Dickerson and other cases of the Court. Payner v. Tennessee, for example, Agostini, a variety of decisions where the Court has explained when it will revisit a precedent and when it will not, and of course the decisions come out both ways. In Payne v. Tennessee the Court went through the analyses. It was a case about whether victims could testify at sentencing. The precedent said no, and they overruled those. Chairman SPECTER. Let me move to two more points before my time is about to expire, 2 minutes and 35 seconds. There is a continuing debate on whether the Constitution is a living thing, and as you see Chief Justice Rehnquist shift his views on Miranda, suggests that he would agree with Justice John Marshall Harlan’s dissent in Poe, where he discusses the constitutional concept of liberty and says, ‘‘The traditions from which it developed, that tradition is a living thing.’’ Would you agree with that? Judge ROBERTS. I’d agree that the tradition of liberty is a living thing, yes. Chairman SPECTER. Let me move in the final two minutes here to your participation, pro bono, in Romer, where you gave some advice on the arguments to those who were upholding gay rights, and a quotation by Walter Smith, who was the lawyer at Hogan & Hartson in charge of pro bono work. He had this to say about your participation in that case supporting or trying to help the gay community in a case in the Supreme Court. Mr. Smith said, ‘‘Every good lawyer knows that if there is something in his client’s cause that so personally offends you, morally, religiously, or if it so offends you that you think it would undermine your ability to do your duty as a lawyer, then you shouldn’t take it on, and John’’— referring to you—‘‘wouldn’t have. So at a minimum he had no concerns that would rise to that level.’’ Does that accurately express your own sentiments in taking on the aid to the gay community in that case?

Judge ROBERTS. I was asked frequently by other partners to help out particularly in my area of expertise, often involved moot courting, and I never turned down a request. I think it’s right that if it had been something morally objectionable, I suppose I would have, but it was my view that lawyers don’t stand in the shoes of their clients, and that good lawyers can give advice and argue any side of a case. And as I said, I was asked frequently to participate in that type of assistance for other partners at the firm, and I never turned anyone down.
Chairman SPECTER. My time just expired. Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Morning. Senator LEAHY. Looks like you survived well yesterday. No one doubts you have had a very impressive legal career thus far, and now you have been nominated to be Chief Justice of the United States, but I have concerns as I go back over your career. We have had some discussions about this already, about some of the themes, and some of the goals you sought to achieve in your career using what is formidable skill. My first area of concern involves a fundamental question of constitutional philosophy, the separation of powers. The last thing our Founding Fathers wanted was to be ruled by a king with absolute power, and the next to the last thing they wanted was to be ruled by a temporary king with absolute power for 4 years. So we have got the political system we talked about a great deal yesterday of checks and balances. Each of the three branches of Government constrains the others when they overreach. Americans have relied on this for our fundamental guarantees of freedom and democracy and open Government. And all of us that serve, whether in the executive branch, the judiciary as you do, the legislative as we do, take an oath to uphold, a very solemn oath to uphold the Constitution. But there have been times throughout our history where the separation of powers has been strained to its limits by Presidents claiming power way beyond, what was actually almost imperial powers. So let us focus this now a little bit more on Presidential power. Let us go to the President’s power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Certainly he has that power under the Constitution. I went back to a time when you were a lawyer in the Reagan White House. You objected to a bill that would give certain preference to veterans who had served in Lebanon between August 20th, 1982 and ‘‘the date the operation ends.’’ The date would be as either set by Presidential proclamation or a concurrent resolution of Congress. And you wrote that the difficulty with such a bill is that it recognizes a role for Congress in terminating the Lebanon operation. And you wrote further, ‘‘I do not think we would want to concede any definite role for Congress in terminating the Lebanon operation even by joint resolution presented to the President.’’ And then you explained parenthetically, that even if the President vetoed such a joint resolution, of course the Congress could override it by a two-thirds majority.

I find that troubling. I will tell you why. Before I read your memo I thought everybody agreed there would be only one answer to the question of whether Congress could stop a war. Your memo suggested Congress is powerless to stop a President who is going to conduct an unauthorized war. I really find that extremely hard to follow, and I imagine most Americans would. I will give you a hypothetical. Congress passes a law for all U.S. Forces to be withdrawn from the territory of a foreign nation by a said date. The President vetoes the law. The Congress overrides that, and sets into law, you must withdraw by a certain date. Now, is there any question in your mind that the President would be bound to faithfully execute that law?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I don’t want to answer a particular hypothetical that could come before the Court, but I’m happy to comment on the memorandum that you’re discussing.
Senator LEAHY. No, wait a minute. I mean is this not kind of hornbook law? I do not know if there would be any cases coming before the Court. I mean this is kind of hornbook. The Congress says to the President, you have to get out, and passes a law which is either signed into law by the President or overridden—or you override a presidential veto. Why would the President not have to—charged as he is under the Constitution to faithfully execute the law, why would he not have to follow that law?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, that issue and similar issues have in fact come up. There were, for example, lawsuits concerning the legality of the war in Vietnam, various efforts, and certainly the arguments would be made on the other side about the President’s authority, and that may well come before the Court.
Senator LEAHY. Judge, with all due respect, the cases in Vietnam were not based on a specific law passed by Congress to get out. I mean Congress did cut off the funding.
Judge ROBERTS. Right. Senator LEAHY. In April 1975 by a one-vote margin on the Armed Services Committee. I know because I was the newest member of the Committee at that time, and I voted to not authorize the war any longer. Are you saying that Congress could not pass a law that we must withdraw forces? Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, I’m not. What I’m saying is that that issue or issues related to that could well come before the Court, and that’s why I have to resist answering your particular hypothetical question. The memo you refer to, I was working in the White House Counsel’s Office then. The White House Counsel’s office is charged to be vigilant to protect the Executive’s authority. Just as you have lawyers here in the Senate and the House has lawyers who are experts and charged with being vigilant to protect the prerogatives of the legislative branch. I believe very strongly in the separation of powers. That was a very important principle that the Framers set forth that is very protective of our individual liberty. It makes sure the legislative branch legislates, the Executive executes, and the judicial branch decides the law. And it makes—it was part of the Framers’ vision that each of the branches would be to a certain extent jealous of what they regarded as their prerogatives, and to the extent there is a dispute

151
between the legislative branch and the executive branch, it’s the job, of course, of the judicial branch to resolve that dispute.
Senator LEAHY. But your position in this memo, and President Reagan’s office, seem to indicate that Congress does not have an ability to end hostilities.
Judge ROBERTS. With respect, Senator, you’re vastly over-reading the memorandum. It concerned—
Senator LEAHY. Tell me why. Judge ROBERTS. Well, because it had nothing to do with terminating hostilities. It had to do with the eligibility for certain pension benefits, and the question then was whether or not—who should be determining when the hostilities ceased or should cease—and there again, a lawyer for the executive branch, not a judge who would be considering the issue in an entirely different light, but a lawyer for the executive branch—a careful lawyer would say there may be a problem there. Are we conceding anything by saying the legislature gets to determine when the hostilities end? Senator LEAHY. I do not think it is over-reading it at all, as you suggest, to say when you write, ‘‘I do not think we would want to concede any definitive role for Congress in terminating the Lebanon operation even by joint resolution presented to the President.’’ Judge ROBERTS. Well, with respect, Senator— Senator LEAHY. You are saying you do not want to concede any ability to the Congress to stop a war. Judge ROBERTS. With respect, Senator, the memorandum is about legislation for—if I’m remembering it correctly, it was 20 some years ago—pension benefits or certain additional pay benefits. That’s what it was about. And I suspect if you asked any lawyer for any President of any administration whether they wanted to concede that general principle, or if as careful lawyers they would prefer that that provision were rewritten or not in there, I’m fairly confident that regardless of the administration, that a lawyer for the Executive would take the same position. Now, I am also fairly confident that one of your lawyers here in the Senate would take the opposite position. Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you this question. Does Congress have the power to declare war? Judge ROBERTS. Of course. The Constitution specifically gives that power to Congress. Senator LEAHY. Does Congress then have the power to stop a war? Judge ROBERTS. Congress certainly has the power of the purse, and that’s the way, as you noted earlier, that Congress has typically exercised its— Senator LEAHY. Yes, but we did that in the Boland amendment, and the Reagan administration, as we found out in the sorry chapter of Iran-Contra, went around that, violated the law, worked with Iran, sold arms illegally to Iran—I think that is part of the axis of evil today—to continue the war, the contra war in Central America. So the power of the purse, we have cut off money, the wars sometimes keep going. Do we have the power to terminate war? We have the power to declare war. Do we have the power to terminate war?

152
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, that’s a question that I don’t think can be answered in the abstract. You need to know the particular circumstances and exactly what the facts are and what the legislation would be like, because the argument on the other side—and as a judge, I would obviously be in a position of considering both arguments, the argument for the Legislature and the argument for the Executive. The argument on the Executive side will rely on authority as Commander in Chief, and whatever authorities derive from that. So it’s not something that can be answered in the abstract.
Senator LEAHY. As you said, your answer is that you were just talking about the question of veterans’ benefits and all after this. I would note that the memo you wrote was not entitled ‘‘Veterans Benefits,’’ it was entitled, ‘‘War Powers Problem.’’ I do not think I overstated.
Let me ask you another question. We spoke about this again this morning, and I had told you when we met—in fact, I gave you a copy of the Bybee memo so that this would not be a surprise to you. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a secret opinion in August 2002, which argued the President enjoys ‘‘complete authority over the conduct of war,’’ and ‘‘the Congress lacks authority to set the terms and conditions under which a President may exercise his authority as Commander in Chief to control the conduct of operations during war.’’ And then took the argument to the extreme when it concluded, the President, when acting as Commander in Chief, was not bound by the Federal law banning the use of torture. In other words, the President would be above the law in that regard. You did not write that memo, I hasten to add, but you have seen it.
I asked Attorney General Gonzales for his view of this memo, in particular this sweeping assertion of Executive power which puts a President above the law. He never gave an answer on that, and that is one of the reasons why many voted against his confirmation.
So now let me ask you this: do you believe that the President has a Commander in Chief override to authorize or excuse the use of torture in interrogation of enemy prisoners even though there may be domestic and international laws prohibiting the specific practice?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I believe that no one is above the law under our system, and that includes the President. The President is fully bound by the law, the Constitution and statutes. Now, there often arise issues where there’s a conflict between the Legislature and the Executive over an exercise of Executive authority, asserted Executive authority. The framework for analyzing that is in the Youngstown Sheet and Tube case, the famous case coming out of President Truman’s seizure of the steel mills.
Senator LEAHY. And the Supreme Court held that unconstitutional.
Judge ROBERTS. Exactly. And the framework that was set forth in Justice Jackson’s concurring opinion, which is the opinion that has sort of set the stage for subsequent cases, analyzes the issues in terms of one of three categories: if the President is acting in an area where Congress is supportive, expressly supportive of his action, the President’s power is at its maximum; if the President is

153
acting in an area such as you postulate under the Bybee memo, where the President is acting contrary to congressional authority; what Justice Jackson said is the President’s authority is at its lowest ebb, it consists solely of his authority under the Constitution, less whatever authority Congress has; and then, of course, there’s the vast middle area where courts often have to struggle because they can’t determine whether Congress has supported a particular exercise or not. The Dames & Moore case, for example, is a good example of that.
Senator LEAHY. Would you consider—go ahead. Judge ROBERTS. I was just going to say the first issue for a Court confronting the question you posed would be whether Congress specifically intended to address the question of the President’s exercise of authority or not. Senator LEAHY. Yes. I would think that if you pass a law saying nobody in our Government shall torture, I think that is pretty specific. But let me ask you this: is Youngstown settled law? Would you consider Youngstown settled law? Judge ROBERTS. I think the approach in the case is one that has guided the Court in this area since 1954 or 1952, whatever it was. Senator LEAHY. The reason I ask that, when Mr. Bybee wrote this memo, he never cited Youngstown, and I think it was Harold Koh, the Dean at the Yale Law School, who said this was a stunning omission. I tend to agree with that. The President instead went ahead and appointed—nominated Mr. Bybee to a Federal judgeship. Judge ROBERTS. Youngstown is a very important case in a number of respects, not least the fact that the opinion that everyone looks to, the Jackson opinion, was by Justice Jackson, who was of course FDR’s Attorney General, and certainly a proponent of expansive Executive powers. Senator LEAHY. You have also said he is one of the Justices you admire the most. Judge ROBERTS. He is for a number of reasons. What’s significant about that aspect of his career, is here is someone whose job it was to promote and defend an expansive view of Executive power as Attorney General, which he did very effectively, and then when he went on the Court, as you can tell from his decision in Youngstown, he took an entirely different view of a lot of issues, in one famous case even disagreeing with one of his own prior opinions, and wrote a long opinion about how he can’t believe he once held those views. I think it’s very important that— Senator LEAHY. Are you sending us a message? [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’m just saying one reason people admire Justice Jackson so much is that although he had strong views as Attorney General, he recognized, when he became a member of the Supreme Court, that his job had changed, and he was not the President’s lawyer, he was not the chief lawyer in the executive branch, he was a Justice sitting in review of some of the decisions of the Executive. And he took a different perspective. And that’s, again, one reason many admire him, including myself.

154
Senator LEAHY. The reason I ask, I thought the memo was outrageous, and once it became public—not until it became public, but after it became public, the President disavowed it and said he is opposed to torture, and I commend him for that. Many wish there had been—the administration had taken that position prior to the press finding out about it. But from the Jackson opinion—and I just pulled it out here—he says: ‘‘the President has no monopoly of war powers, whatever they are. While Congress cannot deprive the President of the command of the Army and Navy, only Congress can provide him an Army or Navy to command. Congress is also empowered to make rules for the Government and regulation of land and naval forces, by which it may to some unknown extent impinge upon even command functions.’’
Do you agree that Congress can make rules that may impinge upon the President’s command functions?
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly, Senator. The point that Justice Jackson is making there is that the Constitution vests pertinent authority in these areas in both branches. The President is the Commander in Chief, and that meant something to the Founders. On the other hand, as you just quoted, Congress has the authority to issue regulations governing the Armed Forces, another express provision in the Constitution. Those two can conflict if by making regulations for the Armed Forces, Congress does something that interferes with, in the President’s view, his command authority, and in some cases those disputes will be resolved in Court, as they were in the Youngstown case.
Senator LEAHY. In his book All the Laws But One, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the late Chief Justice, concluded with this sentence, ‘‘The laws will not be silent in time of war, but they will speak with a somewhat different voice.’’ He offered as a somewhat different voice, of course, the Supreme Court decision, an infamous decision, a horrible decision in my estimation, Korematsu. As we know, in that case the Court upheld the internment of Japanese-Americans in detention camps, not because of anything they had done, not because of any evidence that they were at all disloyal to the United States, but solely based on their race. Sometimes this country has legislated very, very cruelly and very wrongly, solely on the question of race.
Now, the Korematsu majority’s failure to uphold the Bill of Rights I believe is one of the greatest failures in the Court’s history. We cannot, I believe have a Supreme Court that would continue the failings of Korematsu, especially when we are engaged in a war on terror that could last throughout our lifetime, and probably will. This country, all the western world, all democracies will face terrorist attacks, whether internal as we had in Oklahoma City, or external, 9/11. I just want to make sure you are not going to be a Korematsu Justice, so I have a couple of questions.
Can I assume that you would hold the internment of all residents of this country who are interned just because they have a particular nationality or ethnic or religious group, you would hold that to be unconstitutional?
Judge ROBERTS. The internment of a group solely on the basis of their—
Senator LEAHY. Nationality or ethnic or religious group.

155
Judge ROBERTS. I suppose a case like that could come before the Court. I would be surprised to see it, and I would be surprised if there were any arguments that could support it.
Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you this. Do you feel that you would be able to interpret the Bill of Rights the same, whether we are at war or not?
Judge ROBERTS. I do, Senator. I read the Chief’s book that you quoted from, and for someone who sits on the court that I sit on now, we famously look back to one of the first cases decided in the D.C. Circuit. It was the Aaron Burr trial, and it’s, if anything, a motto—
Senator LEAHY. I thought you might— Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s sort of the motto of our court, an opinion that was written out of that, in which the judge explained that it was our obligation to calmly poise the scales of justice in dangerous times as well as calm times. That’s a paraphrase, but the phrase, calmly poise the scales of justice if, if anything, the motto of the court on which I now sit. That would be the guiding principle for me whether I am back on that court or a different one, because some factors may be different, the issues may be different, the demands may be different, but the Bill of Rights remains the same. And the obligation of a court to protect those basic liberties in times of peace and in times of war, in times of stress and in times of calm, that doesn’t change. Senator LEAHY. I hope you feel that way. I often speak of the First Amendment, it is not there to protect popular speech, that is easy, it is unpopular speech. And as I mentioned yesterday, our State really wanted to make sure the Bill of Rights was going to be there before we joined the Union. Let me switch gears a bit. In the area of environmental protection, I feel that you have narrowly construed laws under the Constitution in a way that closed the courthouse doors to millions of parents who want to protect their children from dangerous air pollution or unsafe drinking water, fish contaminated with mercury, foods covered with pesticides. We all know that often the President, no matter who is President, and the local governments do not do enough to protect people in environmental areas, from environmental dangers, and we have given them protection, the Congress has. I thought your Duke Law Journal article, which many have commented about in the press and otherwise, was somewhat dismissive regarding these citizen suits to protect the environment. You wrote that Congress may not ask the courts in effect to exercise oversight of responsibility at the behest of any John Q. Public who happens to be interested in the issue. You discount the interests that many citizens and Congress have in preserving our environment. A few years ago—you sound very much like Justice Scalia—I know a few years ago, the Supreme Court, over the dissent of Justice Scalia, ruled that a citizen living near a stream that had been polluted by many illegal discharges of mercury from an upstream company did have the right to go to court over these illegal mercury discharges. The Government was not enforcing the laws. So I ask you this. People, if their President or their Governor fails to enforce these laws, why should not individuals have access

to courts where polluting companies could be made to pay for their wrongdoing? What can you tell us to assure us, parents or children who are worried about this from birth defects and all, all of us, what can you do to assure us that they as individuals under Chief Justice Roberts would not find the courthouse door slammed shut in their face?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, one thing I would tell them to do is read the rest of the Duke Law Journal article, because one thing it makes—point it makes is that environmental interests, it goes on to say aesthetic interests, those are all protected under the law, and that one reason courts should insist that those who bring suit have standing—that’s the issue—that are actually injured, is because standing can encompass certainly environmental harms. The issue that was being addressed in the Duke Law Journal article was whether anyone could bring a lawsuit just because they are interested in the issue, or whether the plaintiffs had to show that they had been injured. In other words, in your hypothetical, the people who are downstream from the mercury pollution, they will be able to show that they are injured and can bring suit.
The question is whether somebody halfway across the country who’s not injured by that act should be able to bring suit. That was the issue in the—
Senator LEAHY. But I read it also in conjunction with your brief that you wrote in 1991, when you were Kenneth Starr’s political deputy.
This was in Franklin County v. Gwinnett Public Schools. Now, in that case, a girl, Christine Franklin, had been sexually harassed. She had been abused from the time she was in the 10th grade by a teacher and a sports coach. The school was aware of the sexual harassment but took no action, in fact they even encouraged her not to complain. The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education investigated and found her rights were violated under title IX of our civil rights law; she had been physically abused; her right to complain about gender discrimination had been interfered with. You argued that she had no right to damages for this abuse. Now, your view was rejected by the Supreme Court. Justice White, in an opinion joined by Justice O’Connor and others wrote that you fundamentally misunderstood the law and history of the Court’s role in providing appropriate remedy for such abuse, and that you had invited them to abdicate their historical judicial authority to award appropriate relief.
So do you now personally agree with and accept as binding law the reasoning of Justice White’s opinion in Franklin?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, it certainly is a precedent of the Court that I would apply under principles of stare decisis. The Government’s position in that case, of course, in no way condoned the activities involved. The issue was an open one. The courts of appeals had ruled the same way that the Government had argued before the Supreme Court, and it arose because we were dealing with an implied right of action, in other words, right of action under the statute that courts had implied. The reason that there was difficulty in determining exactly what remedies were available is because Congress had not addressed that question. The remedies that were available, as we explained, included issues such as restitu-

tion, back pay, injunctive relief, and the open issue, again, was whether damages were available. The Supreme Court issued its ruling and cleared that up.
Senator LEAHY. But here in this case, I mean it is a pretty egregious case, you have—and I am sure that you in no way condone what happened to this young girl, but I mean it was awful. She would be taken out of class by this teacher, brought to another room, basically raped. And Justice White made it very clear, contrary to what you and Kenneth Starr had said, that she had a right for actions because of that abuse.
Now, do you feel that they were acting, even though it went differently than what you had argued, do you feel the Court’s opinion is based on sound reasoning?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t want to say— Senator LEAHY. Do you think it is a solid precedent? Judge ROBERTS. It is a solid—it’s a precedent of the Court. It was, as you say, a unanimous precedent. It concerned an issue of statutory interpretation because it was unclear whether Congress had intended a particular remedy to be available or not. That was the question before the Court. The court of appeals had ruled one way. The Supreme Court ruled the other way. The administration’s position was based on the principle that the decision about the remedy of back pay was a decision that should be made by Congress and not the Court. The Court saw the case the other, and that issue is now settled, and those damages actions are brought in courts around the country. Senator LEAHY. But I wonder if we are balancing angels on the head of a pin. What kind of back pay was this teenage student going to be seeking? What kind of— Judge ROBERTS. Senator, there— Senator LEAHY. What kind of injunction is she going to get after she graduated? As a parent, and you are a parent, I mean I just wonder are we saying that we will put up a block for people who have really justiciable reasons to be in court? Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator. Again, there was no issue in the case about condoning the behavior. I found it abhorrent then. I find it abhorrent now. That’s not the issue. The issue in the case is did Congress intend for this particular remedy to be available? Other remedies were available under the provision at issue, and the question is, was this remedy available? Senator LEAHY. The back pay. Judge ROBERTS. Restitution and injunction to prohibit the harmful activity. Again, the issue arose because Congress had not spelled out whether there was a right of action in the first place or what the components of that right of action should be. The issue— Senator LEAHY. We will go back to this in my next round, I can assure you. My time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch. Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am happy to be here, and I appreciate your leadership, you and Senator Leahy on this Committee.

I want to welcome you again, Judge Roberts. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you so much. Senator HATCH. I read an interesting book over the weekend, Cass Sunstein’s book, recent book published by Basic Books. He discussed various philosophies with regard to judging, and I would just like to ask you this question. Some of the philosophies he discussed were whether a judge should be an originalist, a strict constructionist, a fundamentalist, a perfectionist, a majoritarian or a minimalist. Which of those categories do you fit in? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I haven’t—I didn’t have a chance to read Professor Sunstein’s book. He writes a different one every week, it’s hard to keep up with. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. But, you know, I think— Senator HATCH. I have read a number of them. Judge ROBERTS. Like most people, I resist the labels. I have told people when pressed that I prefer to be known as a modest judge, and to me that means some of the things that you talked about in those other labels. It means an appreciation that the role of the judge is limited, that a judge is to decide the cases before them, they’re not to legislate, they’re not to execute the laws. Another part of that humility has to do with respect for precedent that forms part of the rule of law that the judge is obligated to apply under principles of stare decisis. Part of that modesty has to do with being open to the considered views of your colleagues on the bench. I would say that’s one of the things I’ve learned the most in the past 2 years on the court of appeals, how valuable it is to function in a collegial way with your colleagues on the bench, other judges being open to your views, you being open to theirs. They, after all, are in the same position you’re in. They’ve read the same briefs. They heard the same arguments. They’ve looked at the same cases. And if they’re seeing things in a very different way, you need to be open to that and try to take another look at your view and make sure that you’re on solid ground. Now, I think that general approach results in a modest approach to judging which is good for the legal system as a whole. I don’t think the courts should have a dominant role in society and stressing society’s problems. It is their job to say what the law is. That’s what Chief Justice Marshall said, of course, in Marbury v. Madison. And, yes, there will be times when either the executive branch or the legislative branch exceeds the limits of their powers under the Constitution or transgresses one of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, and then it is emphatically the obligation of the courts to step up and say what the Constitution provides, and to strike down either unconstitutional legislation or unconstitutional Executive action. But the Court has to appreciate that the reason they have that authority is because they’re interpreting the law, they’re not making policy, and to the extent they go beyond their confined limits and make policy or execute the law, they lose their legitimacy, and I think that calls into question the authority they will need when it’s necessary to act in the face of unconstitutional action. Senator HATCH. I know that I have only mentioned a few of these so-called descriptions of various philosophical attitudes with

159
regard to judging, but am I correct in interpreting that you are probably eclectic, that you would take whatever is the correct way of judging out of each one of those provisions? There may be truths in each one of those provisions, that none of them absolutely creates an absolute way of judging.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I have said I do not have an overarching judicial philosophy that I bring to every case, and I think that’s true. I tend to look at the cases from the bottom up rather than the top down. And like I think all good judges focus a lot on the facts. We talk about the law, and that’s a great interest for all of us, but I think most cases turn on the facts, so you do have to know those, you have to know the record.
In terms of the application of the law, you begin obviously with the precedents before you. There are some cases where everybody’s going to be a literalist. If the phrase in the Constitution says twothirds of the Senate, everybody’s a literalist when they interpret that. Other phrases in the Constitution are broader, ‘‘unreasonable searches and seizures.’’ You can look at that wording all day and it’s not going to give you much progress in deciding whether a particular search is reasonable or not. You have to begin looking at the cases and the precedents, what the Framers had in mind when they drafted that provision.
So, yes, it does depend upon the nature of the case before you I think.
Senator HATCH. Thank you. On the War Powers Act, I remember when Senator Hefflin, years ago, in the Breyer hearing, said, ‘‘You, of course, have been here at various times. Do you have any particular thoughts concerning the authority and what ought to be done relative to this, or do you have feelings that the War Powers Act is a proper approach to this issue?’’ Judge Breyer’s simple answer was, ‘‘I do not have special thoughts that I would think would be particularly enlightening in that area.’’ He did not get drawn into interpreting the War Powers Act for the Committee, and I suspect that that is the way that you feel as well.
Now, my friend, the Chairman, held up a chart with the number of cases that he said relied on Roe v. Wade. In fact, if I heard him correctly he called Roe a super-duper precedent. Now, I am not sure that a super-duper precedent exists, between you and me, but some have said that Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a very important case, reaffirmed Roe. But let me just ask you, am I correct that Casey reaffirmed the central holding in Roe, but substantially changed its framework?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s what the joint opinion of the three Justices said, it was reaffirming the central holding, it revisited and altered the framework.
Senator HATCH. There were only a few votes to simply reaffirm Roe, were there not, in the Casey case?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the plurality opinion is regarded I think as the opinion of—it’s the opinion of the plurality, but as the leading opinion of the Justices of the majority, it’s the one that judges look to in the first instance. There were separate opinions that disagreed with some of the ways in which that plurality revisited Roe. It reaffirmed the central holding in Roe v. Wade. It dispensed with the trimester framework, and it substituted for the strict scrutiny

that Roe had established the undue burden analysis that since the time of Casey has governed in this area.
Senator HATCH. As I recall it, there were only a few votes, as you have mentioned, to simply reaffirm Roe, but does this suggest that Casey itself noted the troubling features of Roe and indicated that Roe’s framework has not been workable?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the question of the workability of the framework is I think one of the main considerations that you look to under principles of stare decisis, along with the settled expectations, whether a precedent has been eroded. That was one of the factors that the Court looked at in Casey in determining I think to alter the framework of Roe, the trimester framework and the strict scrutiny approach, at least in the terms that were applied by the joint opinion.
Senator HATCH. Our Chairman asked if former Chief Justice Rehnquist’s opinion in the Dickerson case, upholding Miranda, would apply to Roe v. Wade, and if I recall correctly, you properly declined to answer. But am I right that Chief Justice Rehnquist repeatedly believed that Roe should be overruled?
Judge ROBERTS. That was his view, yes. Senator HATCH. Does that not mean that Rehnquist himself did not believe that his Dickerson holding should apply to Roe? Would that be a fair conclusion? Judge ROBERTS. Based on his published opinions—now, I don’t remember—well, certainly he wrote in Casey, I don’t know if he’s written since then, so I just hesitate to ascribe views from 1992 to current. Senator HATCH. Okay. The Chairman and Ranking Member have raised some important issues, and I may turn to some of them shortly, but I believe, however, that we should start with first principles before exploring how those principles should be applied. Many activist groups, and some of my Senate colleagues, would like nothing more than that you take a series of litmus tests, that you reveal your positions on issues and tell us where you stand. I have been on this Committee during the hearings on 9 Supreme Court nominations. I voted to confirm all of the nominees, Democrats and Republicans. As I described yesterday, I agree that this Committee needs answers but only to proper questions. The important question is not what your views are on any particular issue. You are not campaigning for elective office. The question that needs to be answered is how you view the role of unelected judges in a representative democracy. I know you have said you do not have what might be described as a carefully calibrated, highly defined judicial philosophy, but as each individual case comes before you with its own unique facts and issues. Yesterday you gave us your commitment that you will approach that case within a certain framework. Now I am more interested in learning more about that framework, that perspective on what you believe your job as a judge really is, than I am in how you specifically implement that framework in specific cases or individual cases. This is where I do differ with some of my colleagues. I want to know more about how you get or how you intend to get to a conclusion, while some appear to only want to know what the conclusion will be like on issues such as abortion. Some think that judges

exist to defend and promote progress, preserving the gains of the past and bringing us to a better future of equality and justice. Now, that does not sound, to use a word you have used to describe judges, very modest to me. On the other hand, Senator DeWine noted Justice Byron White, appointed by President Kennedy, said that judges decide cases, and I thought that that was an important quote yesterday. Yesterday you used the analogy of an umpire who calls balls and strikes, but neither pitches, nor bats.
Please help the Committee sort this out by describing further the role you believe unelected judges play or should play in our system of Government. Are they charged, for example, with using the Constitution to effect cultural and political reform, or does the Constitution require that this should be left to the people and their elected representatives? How can the judiciary sit in constitutional judgment over the legislative and executive branches while still remaining co-equal with them? If you could kind of take a crack at those various questions, I would appreciate it.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Justice White’s insight that was quoted by Senator DeWine yesterday, that judges’ obligation is to decide cases, really has constitutional significance. It goes back to Marbury v. Madison. You know, the Constitution doesn’t have any provision that says, oh, and the judges, by the way, are to interpret the Constitution and tell us what it means. What it says it that the judges are to decide cases that arise under this Constitution, this new Constitution, and under any new laws that the Congress might pass. And what Chief Justice Marshall explained in Marbury v. Madison was that, well, if we’ve got to decide cases, that’s our constitutional obligation, we’ve got to decide whether in a particular case something’s consistent with the Constitution or not. So we have to decide what the Constitution means, and that’s what the Framers intended.
So the obligation to decide cases is the only basis for the authority to interpret the Constitution and laws. That means that judges should be careful in making sure that they have a real case in front of them, a real live dispute between parties who have actual injury involved, actual interests at stake, because that is the basis for their legitimacy. And then they’re to decide that case as a judge would, not as a legislator would based on any view of what’s the best policy, but as a judge would based on the law. That’s why the Framers were willing to have the judges decide cases that required them to interpret the Constitution, because they were going to decide it according to the rule of law.
If the people who framed our Constitution were jealous of their freedom and liberty, they would not have sat around and said, ‘‘Let’s take all the hard issues and give them over to the judges.’’ That would have been the furthest thing from their mind. Now, judges have to decide hard questions when they come up in the context of a particular case. That’s their obligation. But they have to decide those questions according to the rule of law, not their own social preferences, not their policy views, not their personal preferences, according to the rule of law.
Senator HATCH. You have explained that it is not the duty of the judiciary to make the law or to execute it, but to interpret it. I am not naive. Sometimes interpretation is more of an art than a

162
science. There are those who would label ‘‘interpretation’’ absolutely anything a judge might do, or to the text of a statute or Constitution. But it seems to me there comes a point where a judge is using his own creativity and purpose, and crosses the line between interpreting a text written by somebody else, and in a sense creating something new. Now that troubles me, since as I said earlier, I believe in the separation of powers. If a judge crosses the line between interpreting and making the law, he has crossed the line supporting his legitimate authority from the legislative branch’s authority. To me that is a very serious matter.
If we believe, as America’s Founders did, that the separation of powers, not just in theory or in textbook, but in practice in the actual functioning of Government is the linchpin of limited Government and liberty.
How do you distinguish between these two roles of interpreting and making law? And can you assure the Senate and the American people that you will stay on your side of this line?
Judge ROBERTS. I will certainly make every effort to do so, Senator. I appreciate the point that in some cases the question of whether you are interpreting the law or making the law, that that line is hard to draw in some cases. I would say not in most cases. I think most cases, most judges, know what it means to interpret the law, and can recognize when they’re going too far into an area of making law, but certainly there are harder cases. And someone like Justice Harlan always used to explain that when you get to those hard cases, you do need to focus again on the question of legitimacy, and make sure that this is the question that you the judge are supposed to be deciding rather than someone else.
You go to a case like the Lochner case. You can read that opinion today and it’s quite clear that they’re not interpreting the law, they’re making the law. The judgment is right there. They say: We don’t think it’s too much for a baker to work whatever it was, 13 hours a day. We think the legislature made a mistake in saying they should regulate this for their health. We don’t think it hurts their health at all.
It’s right there in the opinion. You can look at that and see that they are substituting their judgment on a policy matter for what the legislature had said. So, you know, the fact that it’s difficult to draw the line doesn’t relieve a judge of an obligation to draw the line.
There are those more academic theorists who say it is a question of degree, and since it’s just a question of degree, you shouldn’t try to draw the line, because it’s hard sometimes to interpret the law without making the law. We’ll throw our hands up and say, well, judges make the law, and proceed from that.
That has not been my experience either as a judge or an advocate. My experience has been in most cases you can see where the line is, and you do know when judges are exceeding their authority and making a law, rather than interpreting it, and careful judges are always vigilant to make sure that they’re adhering to their proper function and not going into the legislative area.
Senator HATCH. All of your experience has been either in the judicial branch from your service as a clerk to then-Justice Rehnquist, and from your current role on the D.C. Circuit, or in the

executive branch, where you worked in the White House Counsel’s Office, Assistant to the Attorney General and Deputy Solicitor General. In contrast, I would note that Justice Breyer brought to the Court his experience as Chief Counsel to this Committee. As many commentators during the oral arguments of the Sentencing Guidelines case, Justice Breyer seemed more than willing to defend congressional prerogatives. Now, what can you tell us to assure the Committee that your lack of experience in working in the legislative branch of Government might contribute to a lack of deference to Federal statutes as you review those Federal statutes on the bench?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I guess the first thing I would say is look at—begin with my opinions as a judge over the past 2 years on the court of appeals. I think they show a healthy regard for the prerogatives of the legislative branch that is appropriate. It is certainly— as an advocate, I’ve certainly been arguing deference to the legislature in appropriate cases. Other cases of course I was on a different side in arguing the opposite, so I’m familiar with the arguments. I have not only been in a position where I’ve been pressing arguments, for example, for the executive branch. I have been arguing cases against the executive branch, and frequently arguing cases for the proposition of deference in favor of the Legislature.
I guess I would just hearken back to the model I was talking about earlier of Justice Jackson, who went from being FDR’s Attorney General to being a Justice on the Court who I think always had a healthy regard for the prerogatives of the legislative branch.
Senator HATCH. You claimed in your questionnaire that judges do not ‘‘have a commission to solve society’s problems.’’ I could not agree more. But this is an interesting formulation. It is worth remembering. I think that my office and your office only exist because the American people have authorized them through the Constitution. In other words, the power that you have as a judge comes from the people. Now, that would be a fair assessment, I take it?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator HATCH. Let me explore this question of precedent a little bit more with you. Obviously, the Supreme Court decides cases involving a range of issues in requiring application of different kinds of law, including regulations and statutes, as well as the Constitution. All of these cases can set precedence which might be relied upon to decide future cases raising similar issues. Now, what is your understanding of the role that precedent plays in these different categories of cases? Is precedent equally authoritative in, for example, regulatory or statutory cases as in constitutional cases? As I understand it, the Supreme Court has long said that the strength of its prior decisions is related in part to the difficulty in correcting errors. In constitutional cases there is no external way to correct an error except by constitutional amendment. The Supreme Court says, therefore, that precedent is weakest in constitutional cases. Now, I have here a list of statements from Supreme Court decisions going back decades and decades to reflect this. In 1997, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote for the Court in Agostini v. Felton, that you mentioned earlier, that stare decisis or precedent is not a command but a policy, and it is a policy that has—and I am
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00175 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

164
quoting Justice O’Connor here—‘‘at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution because our interpretation can be altered only by constitutional amendment or by overruling our prior decisions.’’
In 1944, Justice Reed wrote for the Court in Smith v. Albright, ‘‘In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment and not upon legislative action, this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions.’’
Mr. Chairman, I would like to place this list in the record if I can at this point.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, so ordered. Senator HATCH. Now, the bottom line is that precedent is weakest in constitutional cases. Does this distinction make sense to you, Judge Roberts, and has it in fact resulted in the Supreme Court overruling its previous interpretations of the Constitution with any frequency? Judge ROBERTS. The Court has frequently explained that stare decisis is strongest when you’re dealing with a statutory decision. The theory is a very straightforward one that if the Court gets it wrong, Congress can fix it. And the Constitution, the Court has explained, is different. Obviously, short of amendment, only the Court can fix the constitutional precedents. Senator HATCH. Do you believe that Congress is just as bound by constitutional limits as State legislatures? Judge ROBERTS. There are different limits, of course, but, yes, the limits in the Constitution on Congress are as important as limitations on State legislatures in the Constitution. Senator HATCH. I ask that question because some seem to argue that overturning a statute that we pass here in the national legislature is almost presumptively an example of judicial activism. I have disagree with the Court on some of these statutes. The Morrison case is a perfect illustration to me. I am, along with Senator Biden, the author of the Violence Against Women Act, and I felt that they overreached in that particular case. But in any event, some believe that it is judicial activism, while turning a blind eye to the much more common practice of striking down State legislation is just an afterthought. This argument gets even more complicated when the Supreme Court uses a provision actually in the Constitution, to strike down a congressional statute, but provisions not in the Constitution to strike down State statutes. America’s Founders were clear that the Constitution established a Federal Government of few and defined powers. It cannot regulate any activity it choose, but may only regulate in those areas which the Constitution grants it power to regulate. One familiar area is found in Article I, Section 8, which gives the Congress to regulate, ‘‘to regulate commerce among the various States.’’ Now, do not get me wrong, I do not necessarily agree with the Supreme Court, as I mentioned in the Morrison case. I do not think they always get it right when saying that Congress has overstepped its bounds with respect to regulating interstate commerce. At the same time some have learned that we are sliding into a constitutional abyss because the Court has found just twice in more than 60 years that there is something, anything that it says the

165
Constitution does not allow Congress to do regarding Congress and State legislatures and their enactments.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the obligation to say what the law is, including determining that particular legislation is unconstitutional, is, as Chief Justice Marshall said, emphatically the duty and province of the judicial branch. You and I can agree or disagree on whether the Court is right in a particular case, but if the Court strikes down an Act of Congress and it’s wrong, the Court shouldn’t have done that, that’s not an act of judicial activism, it’s just being wrong.
The obligation to strike down legislation is with the judicial branch. They need—I think as Justice Holmes said, it’s the gravest and most delicate duty that the Court performs, and the reason is obvious. All judges are acutely aware of the fact that millions and millions of people have voted for you and not one has voted for any of us. That means that you have the responsibility of representing the policy preferences of the people making the determination about when legislation is necessary and appropriate and what form that legislation should take.
Our job is a very different one. We have to consider cases that raise the question from time to time whether particular legislation is constitutional, and we have to limit ourselves in doing that to applying the law and not in any way substituting ourselves for the policy choices you’ve made. But it is not, as I would say, it’s not judicial activism when the courts do that. They may be right or they’re wrong, and if they’re wrong, they’re wrong, but it’s not activism.
Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Judge. You know, our time is almost gone. We have talked about a lot of substantive things in this half-hour.
I know that the American Bar Association has three times unanimously given you its highest rating of ‘‘Well Qualified,’’ twice for your appeals court appointment and now again for your Supreme Court nomination. Now, we are going to hear more from the ABA about this later in the week, but I wanted to highlight one thing.
The ABA examines three areas, including judicial temperament, and the ABA has laid out the criteria it uses for this. They include such things as compassion, open-mindedness, freedom from bias, and commitment to equal justice, and you have come out with the highest rating on all of those areas.
Many people note that you have been at the pinnacle of your profession, one of the handful of Supreme Court specialists and a partner at a very prestigious law firm here in Washington, D.C., and yet you have consistently pursued pro bono work, that is, work for free, to help people in need, in which you use your skill and training and legal talent to help others. Perhaps that does not fit with the stereotype that some would force upon you, but it is true and it is real and it says a lot about you as a person.
In the few minutes we have left, please describe some of the pro bono work you have done, why those particular projects are important to you, and what you believe your efforts accomplished. The position that you have been nominated for is Chief Justice of the United States. Do you plan to use that role as a bully pulpit to encourage members of the bar to take seriously their responsibility to

undertake pro bono work as you have done throughout your legal career?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator. If I am confirmed, I would hope to do that, and if I’m not, I would hope to do that back on the court of appeals. I think it’s a very important part of a lawyer’s obligation. I’ll mention just a couple of examples.
I handled an appeal here before the D.C. court of appeals on behalf of a class of welfare recipients who had had their benefits cut off. Our position was that the benefits had been cut off in violation of the Constitution, in violation of their due process rights to notice and an individualized hearing. These were the neediest people in the District and we pressed their argument before the court of appeals.
The first case I argued in the Supreme Court was a pro bono matter for an individual with a double jeopardy claim against the United States, again, someone who didn’t have a lawyer, and I was very happy to do that.
And as I said earlier, I regularly handled moot courts for people. I did one for minority plaintiffs in a voting rights case out of Louisiana. I did one challenging environmental effects in Glacier Bay and another one in the Grand Canyon.
In addition to those actually involving a case, one of the pro bono activities that I’m most committed to is a program sponsored by the Supreme Court Historical Society and an organization called Street Law. They bring high school teachers to D.C. every summer to teach them about the Supreme Court and they can then go back and teach the Court in their classes, and I’ve always found that very, very fulfilling.
Senator HATCH. Thank you. My time is up. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and that Street Law program is a marvelous program. I commend you for your involvement in that. The stark and tragic images of human suffering in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina reminded us yet again that civil rights and equal rights are still the great unfinished business of America. The suffering has been disproportionately borne by the weak, the poor, the elderly, and the infirm, and largely by African-Americans who are forced by poverty, illness, and unequal opportunity to stay behind and bear the brunt of the storm’s winds and floods. I believe that kind of disparate impact is morally wrong in this, the richest country in the world. One question we must consider today is how we can take action to unify our Nation, heal racial division, end poverty, and give reallife meaning to the constitutional mandate that there be equal protection under law. I believe that the Constitution is not hostile to the idea that national problems can be solved at the national level through the cooperative efforts of the three coequal branches of government, the Congress, the Executive, and the Courts, but not every President, not every legislator, and not every judge agrees that the Federal Government has the power to address and to try to remedy the twin national problems of poverty and access to

equal opportunity. I am not talking about a handout, but a hand up, to give all our citizens a fair shot at the American dream.
Judge Roberts, today we want to find out how you view the Constitution and our ability to protect the most vulnerable. Do you believe that Congress has the power to pass laws aimed at eliminating discrimination in our society, or do you believe that our hands are tied, that the elected representatives of the people of the United States are without the power to pass laws aimed at righting wrongs, ending injustice, eliminating the inequalities that we have just witnessed so dramatically and tragically in New Orleans?
The American people want to know where you stand. We want to find out your view of the rule of law and the role of courts in our system. That is why it is so important, and I hope we will receive your frank and candid and complete responses to the questions we ask today.
To start my inquiry, I want to discuss with you the Brown v. Board of Education case, which you have already mentioned this morning, which I believe is the most important civil rights decision in our lifetime. In Brown, decided in 1954, the year before you were born, the Supreme Court concluded unequivocally that black children have the constitutional right to be educated in the same classrooms as white students. The Court rejected the old doctrine of separate but equal, finding that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
In considering the issues raised by Brown, the Court took a broad and real-life view of the question before it. It asked, whether the segregation of children in public school solely on the basis of race, even though physical facilities and other tangible factors may be equal, deprives the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities. Do you agree with the Court’s conclusion that the segregation of children in public school solely on the basis of race is unconstitutional?
Judge ROBERTS. I do. Senator KENNEDY. And do you believe that the Court had the power to address segregation of public schools on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. And you are aware that Brown was a unanimous decision? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. That was the—represented a lot of work by Chief Justice Earl Warren, because my understanding of the history is that it initially was not and he spent—it was reargued. He spent a considerable amount of time talking to his colleagues and bringing them around to the point where they ended up with a unanimous Court. Senator KENNEDY. And a lot of work by the plaintiffs, as well. Judge ROBERTS. I’m sure. Senator KENNEDY. First, in reaching its decision, the Court concluded that it must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the Nation, that is that it must consider the conditions and impact of its decision in the real present-day world. The Court specifically declined to rely on the legislative history of the 14th Amendment. It

looked instead to the facts and situation as they existed in the case and in the world at the time of the decision.
Judge Roberts, do you agree that the Court was correct in basing its decision on real world consideration of the role of public education at the time of its decision, rather than the role of public education in 1868, when the 14th Amendment was adopted?
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly, Senator. The importance of the Court’s approach in Brown is, of course, to recognize that the issue was whether or not the discrimination violated equal protection, and you have to look at the discrimination in the context in which it is occurring. I know there has been a lot of recent academic research into this, the original intent of the drafters of the 14th Amendment. Professor McConnell’s piece suggests that it’s perfectly consistent with the conclusion in Brown, and it also, for the very point you mentioned, was an important one, that the nature of the institution of public education wasn’t formed to the same extent at the time of the drafting—
Senator KENNEDY. In 1868, that is right. Judge ROBERTS.—yes, as it was at the time of the decision. Senator KENNEDY. The Brown Court also held that it was important to look at the effects of segregation on public education. The Court determined that education was so vital to a child’s development and opportunity for advancement in society, where the State had undertaken to provide public education, it must be available to all on equal terms. Thus, it found that the separate education was inherently unequal. So, is it fair for me to conclude you accept both the holding and the reasoning in the Brown case? Judge ROBERTS. Well, the reasoning, though, I think it’s important, is focused on the effects, yes, but the conclusion was that they didn’t care if the effects were equal. In other words, the genius of the decision was the recognition that the act of separating the students was where the violation was and it rejected the defense, certainly just a theoretical one given the actual record, that you could have equal facilities and equal treatment. I think the conclusion, if the record had shown—which it did not—if it had shown perfectly equal treatment in the AfricanAmerican school and in the white school, then Chief Justice Warren’s analysis would be the same because the act of separation is what constituted the discrimination. Senator KENNEDY. If we could move on now, the Brown decision was just the beginning of the historic march for progress towards equal rights for all of our citizens. In the 1960s and 1970s, we came together as a Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, and passed the historic civil rights legislation that was signed by the President to guarantee equality for all of our citizens on the basis of race, then on gender, then on disability. We passed legislation to eliminate the barriers to voting that so many minorities had faced in too many States in the country. We passed legislation that prevented racial discrimination in housing. Those landmark laws were supported by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and they were signed into law by both Republican and Democratic Presidents. Intelligent and dedicated attorneys in the Justice Department and in the White House and on Capitol Hill devoted their extraordinary talents and imagination

and perseverance to making these laws effective. Every one of the new laws was tested in court all the way to the Supreme Court, and I would like to find out, Judge Roberts, whether you would agree that the progress that we made in civil rights over the past 50 years is irreversible.
I would like to find out whether you think that these laws are constitutional or whether you have any concerns or questions about them. Do you have any concerns or reservations about the constitutionality of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and other areas?
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t think any issue has been raised concerning those. You know, I’m cautious, of course, about expressing an opinion on a matter that might come before the Court. I don’t think that’s one that’s likely to come before the Court, so I’m not aware of any questions that have been raised concerning that, Senator.
Senator KENNEDY. So, I’ll assume that you don’t feel that there are any doubts on the constitutionality of the 1964 Act. Do you have any doubts as to the constitutionality of the 1965 Voting Rights Act?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s an issue, of course, as you know, it’s up for renewal and that is a question that could come before the Court. The question of Congress’s power, again, without expressing any views on it, I do know that it’s going to be—
Senator KENNEDY. That’s gone up and down the Supreme Court, the 1965 Act and again the 1982 Act extension.
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, and the issue would be— Senator KENNEDY. I am just trying to find out, on the Voting Rights Act, whether you have any problem at all or are troubled by the constitutionality of the existing Voting Rights Act that was extended by the Congress— Judge ROBERTS. Oh, well, the existing Voting Rights Act, the constitutionality has been upheld— Senator KENNEDY. Okay. Judge ROBERTS.—and I don’t have any issue with that. There is a separate question that would be raised if the Voting Rights Act were extended, as I know Congress is considering, and those arguments have been raised about whether or not particular provisions should be extended or should not be extended, and since those questions might well come before the Court, I do need to exercise caution on that. Senator KENNEDY. But with regards to the bipartisan Act that we passed, your position on the 1982 Act, I know you had concerns, and I am going to come back to those, but you are not suggesting that there is any constitutional issue with that? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’m not aware of any constitutional issue that’s been raised about it. Senator KENNEDY. All right. Judge ROBERTS. But again, I don’t want to express conclusions on hypothetical questions, whether as applied in a particular case, whether there would be a challenge in that respect. Those cases come up all the time— Senator KENNEDY. All right.

Judge ROBERTS.—and I do need to keep—avoid expressing an opinion on those issues.
Senator KENNEDY. Well, it seems that on voting rights, with all of its importance and significance, and with the extraordinary bipartisan balance that came together on that Act, I am going to come back to it. I know you had some reservations about it, which we will come to. But that, I am wondering whether you are hesitant at all in saying that you believe that it is constitutional.
Judge ROBERTS. My hesitancy, Senator, is simply this, that cases do come up—I had one in the D.C. Circuit—concerning issues under the Voting Rights Act—
Senator KENNEDY. All right. Judge ROBERTS.—and I don’t know what arguments parties will be raising in those cases. So an abstract question, you need to know obviously what is the claim, what is the issue, and decide it according to the rule of law. Senator KENNEDY. How about the constitutionality of the 1968 Fair Housing legislation that outlaws racial discrimination in housing? Judge ROBERTS. Again, I think that my understanding is it’s been upheld and I’m not aware of any issues that are arising under it. I suppose if there’s a particular claim that’s entered under that statute, litigants make all sorts of arguments and they may raise an argument that it’s unconstitutional as applied in a particular case and the court would have to decide that question. Senator KENNEDY. Well, I was sort of aiming your answer to my friend, Orrin Hatch, about the power of the legislature and the deference that you are going to give when the legislature makes judgments and findings, particularly in the areas of voting, that we spend such an extraordinary amount of time. The Chairman was so involved in that legislation. Let us go to the Voting Rights Act. As you know, we have had a chance to go through many of the documents that you authored during the early and mid-1980s when you worked in the Department of Justice and in the White House and I am deeply troubled. Let me point out that we don’t have all the documents that we would like to have. I am working with the documents that we do have and I want to go through those, get your reactions, and ask your views today. I am deeply troubled by the narrow and cramped, and perhaps even a mean-spirited view of the law that appears in some of your writings. In the only documents that have been made available to us, it appears that you did not fully appreciate the problem of discrimination in our society. It also seems that you were trying to undo the progress that so many people had fought for and died for in this country. At the outset, I want to be clear that I do not think, nor am I suggesting, that you are a person who is in favor of discrimination. I don’t believe that. I am concerned, however, that at the time you were writing these laws and memoranda and notes, you simply did not grasp the seriousness of the impact of discrimination on our country as a whole. Let’s start with the Voting Rights Act. Most Americans think that the right to vote is among the most important tools that they

171
have to participate in our democracy. You do agree, don’t you, Judge Roberts, that the right to vote is a fundamental constitutional right?
Judge ROBERTS. It is preservative, I think, of all the other rights. Without access to the ballot box, people are not in the position to protect any other rights that are important to them. And so I think it’s one of, as you said, the most precious rights we have as Americans.
Senator KENNEDY. And you will recall that in the 1960s, millions of our fellow citizens were denied access to the voting booth because of race, and to remedy that injustice, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that outlawed discrimination in voting. Section 2 of that Act is widely believed to be the most effective civil rights statute enacted by Congress.
In 1982, Congress took action to extend the Voting Rights Act and to make it clear that discriminatory voting practices and procedures are illegal if they are intended to be racially discriminatory or if they are shown to have a racially discriminatory impact. It was this latter prohibition, the prohibition against voting practices that have a discriminatory impact, that provoked your heated opposition, Judge Roberts.
In our earlier discussion of Brown v. Board of Education, you agreed that the actual impact of racial segregation on public education and school children was perfectly valid for the Court to consider, but when it came to voting rights, you rejected the consideration of actual impact. You wrote that violations of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and I quote, ‘‘should not be made too easy to prove since they provide a basis for the most intrusive interference imaginable by Federal courts into State and local processes.’’
You also wrote, and I quote, ‘‘it would be difficult to conceive of a more drastic alteration of local government affairs, and under our Federal system such an intrusion should not be too readily permitted.’’
And you didn’t stop there. You concluded that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was, quote, ‘‘constitutionally suspect and contrary to the most fundamental tenets of the legislating process on which the laws of this country are based.’’
I am deeply troubled by another statement that you made at the time, and I quote, ‘‘there is no evidence of voting abuses nationwide supporting the need for such a change.’’ No evidence? I was there, Judge Roberts, both the House and the Senate had the extensive hearings. We considered detail-specific testimony from affected voters throughout the country.
But you dismissed the work of Congress out of hand. ‘‘Don’t be fooled,’’ you wrote, ‘‘by the House vote or the 61 Senate sponsors of the bill. Many members of the House did not know that they were doing more than simply extending the Act, and several of the 61 Senators have already indicated they only intended to support a simple extension.’’
Judge Roberts, Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly supported this legislation, but you thought we didn’t really know what we were doing. Newt Gingrich and James Sensenbrenner voted for the House bill. Dan Quayle was an original Senate cosponsor of the bill. We held extensive hearings, created a lengthy record, yet you

thought there was no evidence of voting abuses that would justify the legislation.
Your comment? Do you believe today that we need Federal laws to assure that all our citizens have the equal access to the voting booth, and do you basically support the 1982 Voting Rights Act signed by President—
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, you will recall at the time of the—this was 23 years ago. I was a staff lawyer in the Justice Department. It was the position of the Reagan administration for whom I worked, the position of the Attorney General for whom I worked, that the Voting Rights Act should be extended for the longest period of its extension in history without change. The Supreme Court had interpreted in the Mobile v. Bolden case, Section 2 to have an intent test, not an effects test.
Keep in mind, of course, as you know very well, Section 5, the pre-clearance provision, had always had an effects test, and that would be continued. The reference to discrimination nationwide was addressing the particular point that the effects test had been applied in particular jurisdictions that had a history of discrimination and the question is whether or not there was a similar history of discrimination that supported extending the effects test in Section 2.
It was the position of the administration for which I worked that the proposal was to extend the Voting Rights Act without change. Your position at the time was that the intent test that the Supreme Court had determined was in Section 2 should be changed to the effects test, and that was the position that eventually prevailed.
There was no disagreement— Senator KENNEDY. Judge Roberts, the effects test was the law of the land from the Zimmer case to the Mobile case. It was the law of the land. Judge ROBERTS. Senator— Senator KENNEDY. That was the law of the land. Court after court decided about the impact of the effects test. The Mobile case changed the Zimmer case. Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, you disagree— Chairman SPECTER. Senator, let him finish his answer. Senator KENNEDY. Okay. Well, I would just like to get his view of whether the Zimmer case was not the holding and the law of the land prior to the Mobile case. Judge ROBERTS. Well, this is the same debate that took place 23 years ago on this very same issue, and the administration’s position—you think the Supreme Court got it wrong in Mobile v. Bolden. Senator KENNEDY. No, that’s not what I think. It was wrong, but I also think the law of the land decided in the Zimmer case upheld in court after court after court after court was the effects test. Judge ROBERTS. Well, and the Supreme Court— Senator KENNEDY. And that is all— Chairman SPECTER. Let him finish his answer, Senator Kennedy. Judge ROBERTS. The point is, and again, this is revisiting a debate that took place 23 years ago—

173
Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am interested today in your view. Do you support the law that Ronald Reagan signed into law and that was cosponsored overwhelmingly by the—
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. And the only point I would make, this is the same disagreement and the same debate that took place then over whether the Court was right or wrong in Mobile v. Bolden, and the point I would make is two-fold, that those like President Reagan, like Attorney General Smith, who were advocating extension of the Voting Rights Act without change, were as fully committed to protecting the right to vote as anyone.
Senator KENNEDY. Could I— Chairman SPECTER. Let him finish his answer, Senator Kennedy. Judge ROBERTS. And the articulation of views that you read from represented my effort to articulate the views of the administration and the position of the administration for whom I worked, for which I worked, 23 years ago. Senator KENNEDY. Well, after President Reagan signed it into law, did you agree with that position— Judge ROBERTS. I certainly— Senator KENNEDY.—of the Administration? Judge ROBERTS. I certainly agreed that the Voting Rights Act should be extended. I certainly agreed that the effects test in Section 5 should be extended. We had argued that the intent test— that the Supreme Court recognized in Mobile v. Bolden—I know you think it was wrong, but that was the Supreme Court’s interpretation—should have been extended. Again, as you said, the compromise that you and Senator Dole worked out was enacted into law and signed into law by President Reagan and the Voting Rights Act has continued to be an important legislative tool to ensure that most precious of rights which is preservative of all other rights. There was never any dispute about that basic proposition. Senator KENNEDY. Well, what I am getting to is after it was overwhelmingly passed by the House and the Senate, signed into law, we have the memorandum that you said the fact we were burned last year—this is the following year, because we did not sail in with the new voting rights legislation does not mean we will be hurt this year if we go slowly on housing legislation. What did you mean when you said that we were burned last year by not getting the Voting Rights Act? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think the legislative debate between those who favored extending the Voting Rights Act as is and those who favored changing the Act because they disagreed with the Supreme Court decisions, the legislative judgment was that the administration’s proposal didn’t succeed because they had waited— rather than coming out in favor of an extension right away, they waited for the Congress to come up with its proposals which turned out to be different than the administration proposals. On the housing discrimination, I would note that the administration did get its ducks in a row, and in a matter of months after the date of the memo that you just read from had its housing proposal there and submitted to Congress and it was enacted. Senator KENNEDY. Nineteen Eighty-Eight Fair Housing Act. Judge ROBERTS. The administration’s proposal was submitted, I believe, months after the date of the memo that you read from.

174
Senator KENNEDY. Let me, if I could, go to the Civil Rights Restoration Act. In 1981, you supported an effort by the Department of Education to reverse 17 years of civil rights protections at colleges and universities that receive Federal funds. Under the new regulations, the definition of Federal assistance to colleges and universities would be narrowed to exclude certain types of student loans and grants so that fewer institutions would be covered by the civil rights laws. As a result, more colleges and universities would legally be able to discriminate against people of color, women, and the disabled.
Your efforts to narrow the protection of the civil rights laws did not stop there, however. In 1984, in Grove City v. Bell, the Supreme Court decided, contrary to the Department of Education regulations that you supported, that student loans and grants did, indeed, constitute Federal assistance to colleges for purposes of triggering civil rights protections.
But in a surprising twist, the Court concluded that the non-discrimination laws were intended to apply only to the specific program receiving the funds and not to the institution as a whole.
Under that reasoning, a university that received Federal aid in the form of tuition could not discriminate in admissions, but was free to discriminate in athletics, housing, faculty hiring, and any other programs that did not receive the direct funds. If the admissions office didn’t discriminate, if they got the funds through the admissions office, they could discriminate in any other place of the university.
A strong bipartisan majority in both the House and the Senate decided to pass another law, the Civil Rights Restoration Act, to make it clear that they intended to prohibit discrimination in all programs and activities of a university that received Federal assistance. You vehemently opposed the Civil Rights Restoration Act. Even after the Grove City Court found otherwise, you still believed that there was—and this is your quote—‘‘a good deal of intuitive appeal to the argument that Federal loans and grants to students should not be viewed as Federal financial assistance to the university.’’ You realize, of course, that these loans and grants to the students were paid to the university as tuition. Then even though you acknowledged that the program-specific aspect of the Supreme Court decision was going to be overturned by the congressional legislation, you continued to believe that it would be ‘‘too onerous’’ for colleges to comply with nondiscrimination laws across the entire university unless it was ‘‘on the basis of something more solid than Federal aid to students.’’
Judge Roberts, if your position prevailed, it would have been legal in many cases to discriminate in athletics for girls, women; it would have been legal to discriminate in the hiring of teachers; it would have been legal not to provide services or accommodations to the disabled.
Do you still believe today that it is too onerous for the Government to require universities that accept tuition payments from students who rely on Federal grants and loans not to discriminate in any of their programs of activities?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, and I did not back then. You have not accurately represented my position.

Senator KENNEDY. These are your words. Chairman SPECTER. Let him finish his answer. Judge ROBERTS. Senator, with respect— Chairman SPECTER. You had quite a long— Judge ROBERTS.—you have selected— Chairman SPECTER. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Senator Kennedy just propounded a very, very long question. Now, let him answer the question. Judge ROBERTS. Senator, you did not accurately represent my position. The Grove City College case presented two separate questions, and it was a matter being litigated, of course, in the courts. The universities were arguing that they were not covered at all by the civil rights laws in question simply because their students had Federal financial assistance and attended their universities. That was their first argument. The second argument was, even if they were covered, all that was covered was the admissions office and not other programs that themselves did not receive separate financial assistance. Our position, the position of the administration—and, again, that was the position I was advancing. I was not formulating policy. I was articulating and defending the administration position. And the administration’s position was, yes, you are covered if the students receive Federal financial assistance, and that the coverage extended to the admissions office. That was the position that the Supreme Court agreed with. We were interpreting legislation. The question is: What is the correct interpretation of the legislation? The position that the administration advanced was the one I have just described. The universities were covered due to Federal financial assistance to their students. It extended to the admissions office. The Supreme Court in the Grove City case agreed with that position. So the position the administration had articulated, the Supreme Court concluded, was a correct interpretation of what this body, the Congress, had enacted. Congress then changed the position about coverage, and that position was, I believe, signed into law by the President and that became the new law. The memo you read about Secretary Bell’s proposal, if I remember it, was, well, he said, if we’re going to cover all of the universities, then we shouldn’t hinge coverage simply on Federal financial assistance. And the position I took in the memorandum was that, no, we should not revisit that question. We should not revisit the question that Federal financial assistance triggers coverage. Senator KENNEDY. I have the memo here. I have 22 seconds left. And your quote is this, ‘‘If the entire institution is to be covered, however, it should be on the basis of something more solid than Federal aid to the students.’’ I think most of the Members of the Congress feel that if the aid to the universities, tuition, loans and grants are going to be sufficient to trigger all of the civil rights laws—your memorandum here, ‘‘If the entire institution is to be covered, however, it should be on the basis of something more solid than Federal aid to the students.’’ That is your memorandum.

Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, again, the administration policy was as I articulated it, and it was my job to articulate the administration policy.
Senator KENNEDY. My time is up, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Yes, thank you very much, Senator Kennedy. This is a good time for a 15-minute break. [Recess 11:31 to 11:47 a.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will reconvene our hearing. We will take three more rounds of questions so that we will go until approximately—there will be two more rounds of questions until 12:45, and we will then break for lunch. Both Republicans and Democrats have their policy luncheons, and we will then reconvene after lunch until 2:15. I have been asked how late we are going to go, and let’s see how it feels.

Judge Roberts, for a second time I would congratulate you and your family on your nomination. I would also for a second time thank you for the time you spent in my office for me to talk privately with you several weeks ago. I am impressed by your record, your public service, and obviously you demonstrate your intellect very well, and we ought to be satisfied with that. Let me remind everybody that Judge Roberts was confirmed unanimously to the D.C. Circuit Court just 2 years ago by the Senate and that the ABA, the American Bar Association, has recommended him to be, in their words, ‘‘unanimously well qualified’’ for this position on the Supreme Court. So I believe with everything we have seen demonstrated, you are obviously as qualified a nominee as I have seen in the 24 years that I have been on this Committee. In addition, I want to thank you for a great deal of candor you have in answering questions and giving information. The Judiciary Committee has received from you or from Government agencies that you have been affiliated with thousands of documents on your record—thousands of documents. And we all have combed through the documents, the briefs, and opinions that you have offered to assess your qualifications to the Supreme Court. I think that we have been provided with a vast amount of information, more than I think any other candidate to the Supreme Court. This confirmation process is very important, however, not so that we can seek to obtain your commitments on specific cases but, rather, to more fully understand your approach to deciding cases. In addition, you have been nominated to be Chief Justice, so I am going to be interested, in some of my questioning today or tomorrow, about your priorities for the Federal judiciary and what you think about the administration of justice and some of those questions you might anticipate do not involve cases coming before the Supreme Court. And maybe on administering that branch of Government, you could be a little more concrete what you support and do not support. And, of course, lastly, I appreciate your candor and thoughtfulness. Our conversation now will not only tell us more about your judicial method, but will also, I hope, educate the public on the proper

role of a judge in our democratic society. Most people who will be following these hearings will be, like me, a non-lawyer, and I think it is important that the bulk of our society, particularly those who are not in the law, understand limits on judicial power in our system of checks and balances of Government.
Judge Roberts, I believe that we should be filling the Federal bench with individuals who will be fair, who will be unbiased, devoted to addressing facts and the law before them, without imposing their own values and political believes in reaching a decision. You made clear that you agree with that—I am not asking you, but I think you made clear that you agree with that with your umpire analogy that you used yesterday. Our Founding Fathers clearly intended the judiciary to be the least dangerous branch of Government. Alexander Hamilton, in fact, in Federalist Paper 78 cautioned against judges substituting their own belief for constitutional intent when he wrote these words: ‘‘The Courts must declare the sense of the law, and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequences would be the substitution of their pleasure for that of the legislative body.’’
I think that this standard is important for all judges, even more so with Supreme Court Justices, and I hope at the end of our hearings that we feel, as I am beginning to feel now, that you share that.
So, Judge Roberts, beyond your umpire analogy, what do you understand to be the role of a judge in a democratic society? And I would like your reaction to a quote of Justice Cardozo on the nature of the judicial process, and he said this, not paraphrasing but direct quote: ‘‘The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not knight-errant roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague or unregulated benevolence. He is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to the primordial necessity of order in social life. Wide enough in all conscience is the field of discretion that remains.’’
What do you think Justice Cardozo meant by that passage? And do you agree with it?
Judge ROBERTS. I know I agree with it. Now let me figure out what he meant by it.
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I think what he meant was that judges operate as judges when they are confined by the law. When I became a lawyer, the proclamation they read for the graduates, they referred to the law as ‘‘the wise restraints that make men free.’’ And judges are the same way. We don’t turn a matter over to a judge because we want his view about what the best idea is, what the best solution is. It’s because we want him or her to apply the law. They are constrained when they do that. They are constrained by the words that you choose to enact into law in interpreting the law. They are constrained by the words of the Constitution. They are constrained by the precedents of other judges that become part of the rule of law that they must apply. And that cabining of their discretion, that is what Hamilton referred to in Federalist 78. He said judges should not have an absolute discretion; they need to be bound down

by rules and precedents—the rules, the laws that you pass, the precedents that judges before them have shaped. And then their job is interpreting the law. It is not making the law. And so long as they are being confined by the laws, by the Constitution, by the precedents, then you’re more comfortable that you’re exercising the judicial function. It’s when you’re at sea and you don’t have anything to look to that you need to begin to worry that this isn’t what judges are supposed to do.
Senator GRASSLEY. Well, is there any room in constitutional interpretation for the judge’s own values or beliefs?
Judge ROBERTS. No, I don’t think there is. Sometimes it’s hard to give meaning to a constitutional term in a particular case. But you don’t look to your own values and beliefs. You look outside yourself to other sources. This is the basis for, you know, that judges wear black robes, because it doesn’t matter who they are as individuals. That’s not going to shape their decision. It’s their understanding of the law that will shape their decision.
Senator GRASSLEY. Some legal scholars claim that when the political branches of Government are slow to act, the broad and spacious terms of the Constitution lend themselves to Court-created solutions. So you agree with this role of the Court?
Judge ROBERTS. I have said that it is not the job of the Court to solve society’s problems, and I believe that. It is the job of the Court to decide particular cases. Now, sometimes cases are brought and the courts have to decide them even though the other branches have been slow to act, as you say. Brown v. Board of Education is a good example. The other branches and society were not addressing the problems of segregation in the schools. They were not just slow to act. They weren’t acting. But that didn’t mean the courts should step in and act. But when the courts were presented with a case that presented the challenge, this segregation violates the Equal Protection Clause, the courts did have the obligation to decide that case and resolve it, and in the course of doing that, of course, change the course of American history.
Senator GRASSLEY. Your reference to Brown would be a good time to throw in this question. Do you agree with the view that the courts, rather than the elected branches, should take the lead in creating a more just society?
Judge ROBERTS. Again, it is the obligation of the courts to decide particular cases. Often that means acting on the side of justice as we understand it, enforcing the Bill of Rights, enforcing the Equal Protection Clause. But it has to be in the context of a case, and it has to be in the context of interpreting a provision that’s implicated in that case. They don’t have a license to go out and decide I think this is an injustice and so I’m going to do something to fix it. That type of judicial role I think is inconsistent with the role the Framers intended. When they have to decide a case, it may well from time to time in particular cases put them in the role of vindicating the vision of justice that the Framers enacted in the Constitution, and that is a legitimate role for them. But it’s always in the context of deciding a proper case that’s been presented.
Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Roberts, during the Souter nomination, I questioned—and I didn’t go back and check the record just to see exactly what I said, but I questioned in some way about how he

179
would interpret statutory law. Justice Souter responded to some of my questions by talking about vacuums in the law, specifically that the courts—and these are his words—‘‘fill vacuums that are maybe left by Congress.’’
This concept was troubling to me then and remains so today, and if Justice Souter is listening, I would like to say to him, well, you know, maybe Congress intended to leave some vacuums.
So I would like to know how much filling in of vacuums in the law left by Congress will you do as a Supreme Court Justice. Do you think this is the way for the Court to be activist in that courts will be deciding how to fill in generalities and resolve contradictions in law?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t want to directly comment on what Justice Souter said. He’s either going to be a colleague or continue to be one of my bosses.
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. So I want to maintain good relations in either case. But I do think it’s important to recognize in construing legislation that sometimes a decision has been made not to address a particular problem. That isn’t a license for the courts to go ahead and address it because that would be overriding a congressional decision. At the same time, as is always the case, courts are sometimes put in the position of having to decide a question that Congress has left deliberately or inadvertently unanswered. We see that in the issue of what remedies are available under an implied right of action when Congress has not spelled them out and the courts sometimes have to address that sort of question. And if it’s presented in a case, it’s unavoidable. But, again, I resort back to the bedrock principle of legitimacy in the American system for courts, which is that any authority to interpret the law, any authority to interpret the Constitution, derives from the obligation to decide a particular case or controversy. Senator GRASSLEY. In your questionnaire to the Committee, you stated that, ‘‘Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability of the legal system.’’ I think we would all agree. You also said that a judge operates within ‘‘a system of rules developed over the years by other judges equally strident to live up to their judicial oath.’’ It is also true that, as Justice Frankfurter explained, ‘‘The ultimate touchstone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself, not what we have said about it. Erroneous interpretations of the Constitution can be corrected only by this Court.’’ I suppose by constitutional amendment as well. The Court has done so many times, and most famously—you have referred to it—the Brown case, which overruled separate but equal, a precedent that stood for 58 years. So, Judge Roberts, I would like to ask you a few questions on the issue of precedence and its value in our legal system. History has provided many examples of the dangers of Government by the judiciary, such as the Court’s decision in Dred Scott. Do you share President Lincoln’s concerns that I am going to quote here from his first inaugural: ‘‘If the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the Supreme Court the instant they are made in ordinary litigation, the people will have ceased to be their own rulers’’?

180
Judge ROBERTS. Well, President Lincoln, of course, was referring to one of the—perhaps the most egregious examples of judicial activism in our history, the Dred Scott case, in which the Court went far beyond what was necessary to decide the case, and really, I think historians would say that the Supreme Court tried to put itself in the position of resolving the dispute about the extension of slavery, and resolving it in a particular way that it thought was best for the Nation. And we saw what disastrous consequences flowed from that. And Lincoln’s comment about it—and he had several comments, because even when he was running for Senate, a big part of the famous debates were, well, this is what the Supreme Court has said, are you going to follow it or not? And Lincoln was a very careful lawyer in his responses. And the reason it was such a problem is because he was dealing with such an overarching Supreme Court decision. They didn’t even just decide the particular case. The Court decided to take upon itself, opining more generally on how the whole issue should be resolved. And, of course, as I said, it was a disaster.
So, yes, to the extent Lincoln’s criticism is how broad and overreaching the Court opinion was and that that in itself presented a very difficult problem in terms of adherence to the decision, I do agree with that.
Senator GRASSLEY. Let me carry that one step further beyond his quote. You now as an appeals court judge obviously are bound by Supreme Court precedent. But on the Supreme Court, a Justice has much more freedom to re-evaluate prior Supreme Court decisions. I would like to explore the approach that you would take in your examination of Supreme Court precedents. Could you tell us what you believe is the appropriate judicial role describing for us the value of precedent in our legal system?
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly, and here, again, we’re guided by the Court. It has precedent on precedents. It has cases talking about when you should revisit prior precedents and when you shouldn’t. And, of course, some of the cases say you should in the particular instance and others that you shouldn’t. You begin with a basic recognition of the value of precedent. No judge gets up every morning with a clean slate and says, well, what should the Constitution look like today? The approach is a more modest one. You begin with the precedents. Adherence to precedent promotes evenhandedness, promotes fairness, promotes stability and predictability. And those are very important values in a legal system. Those precedents become part of the rule of law that the judge must apply.
At the same time, as the Court pointed out in the Casey case, stare decisis is not an inexorable command. If particular precedents have proven to be unworkable, they don’t lead to predictable results, they’re difficult to apply, that’s one factor supporting reconsideration. If the bases of the precedents have been eroded—in other words, if the Court decides a case saying because of these three precedents we reach this result, and in the intervening years two of those are overruled, that’s another basis for reconsidering the precedent.
At the same time, you always have to take into account the settled expectations that have grown up around the prior precedent. It is a jolt to the legal system to overrule a precedent, and that has
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00192 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

181
to be taken into account, as well as the different expectations that have grown up around it.
There are different other aspects of the rules. For example, property decisions are far less likely to be reconsidered because of the expectations that grow up around them. Statutory decisions are less likely to be reconsidered because Congress can fix it if it’s a mistake.
Again, the Court’s decisions in cases like Casey and Dickerson, Payner v. Tennessee, and Agostini, State Oil Company v. Khan, it’s an issue that comes up on a regular basis, and the Court has developed a body of law that would guide judges and Justices when they decide whether to revisit a case.
The fundamental proposition is that it is not sufficient to view the prior case as wrongly decided. That’s the opening of the process, not the end of the process. You have to decide whether it should be revisited in light of all these considerations.
Senator GRASSLEY. Given your views on judicial restraint, can you tell us to what extent you feel obliged to uphold a decision which you found not to be based on the original intent of the Constitution? Could you explain what factors or criteria you might use to evaluate to see whether a decision deviated from original intent and whether it should be overruled?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, you would start with the precedents of the Court on that decision. In other words, if you think the decision was correctly decided or wrongly decided, that doesn’t answer the question of whether or not it should be revisited. You do have to look at whether or not the decision has led to a workable rule. You have to consider whether it’s created settled expectations that should not be disrupted in the interest of regularity in the legal system. You do have to look at whether or not the bases of the precedent have been eroded. Those are the main considerations that the Court has articulated in a case like Dickerson, Payner v. Tennessee, and the others. These are all the factors that the Court looks at.
Obviously, a view about the case presents the question, but the Court has emphasized it’s not enough to think that the decision is wrong to take the next step to revisit it and overrule.
Senator GRASSLEY. In your confirmation for the D.C. Circuit, you answered a question, asked by another member, whether you supported the originalist approach to constitutional interpretation by saying this, so I hope I am quoting you accurately: ‘‘I do not have an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation. The appropriate approach depends to some degree on the specific provisions at issue. Some provisions of the Constitution provide considerable guidance on how they should be construed; others are less precise. I would not hew to a particular school of interpretation but would follow the approach or approaches that seem most suited in the particular case to correctly discerning the meaning of the provision at issue.’’
Could you explain what approaches you are talking about? I am not sure in your quote what you are getting at. Secondly, can you give some examples? And, three, I would like to know when you do not believe that the originalist approach is the right approach.

182
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think it’s very important to define these terms. Let’s take ‘‘the originalist approach.’’ I do think it’s the— that the Framers’ intent is the guiding principle that should apply. However, you do need to be very careful and make sure that you’re giving appropriate weight to the words that the Framers used to embody their intent.
I think in particular of the 14th Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. There are some who may think they’re being originalists who will tell you, well, the problem they were getting at were the rights of the newly freed slaves, and so that’s all that the Equal Protection Clause applies to. But, in fact, they didn’t write the Equal Protection Clause in such narrow terms. They wrote more generally. That may have been a particular problem motivating them, but they chose to use broader terms, and we should take them at their word, so that it is perfectly appropriate to apply the Equal Protection Clause to issues of gender and other types of discrimination beyond the racial discrimination that was obviously the driving force behind it. That is an originalist view because you’re looking at the original intent as expressed in the words that they chose, and their intent was to use broad language, not to use narrow language.
There are some areas where a very strict textualist approach makes the most sense. Obviously, the example I gave earlier, twothirds means two-thirds. You don’t say, well, their purpose was to apply some super-majority requirement, and now that we have more Senators, three-fifths will give effect to that intent. Nobody would apply that approach. You stick to the language.
In other areas, the Court’s precedents dictate the approach. This is not something that is purely a matter of academic exercise. For example, on the Seventh Amendment, the right to a jury trial, the Court has been very specific. We have a historical approach there. The job of a judge is to sort of look at whatever action is and try to analogize it. What would that be most like in 1787? And if you got a jury trial for that, you get one today; and if you didn’t, you don’t. It’s a purely historical approach.
So the approaches do vary, and I don’t have an overarching view. As a matter of fact, I don’t think very many judges do. I think a lot of academics do. But the demands of deciding cases and the demands of deciding cases by committee, either a group of three or a group of nine, I find with those demands the nuances of academic theory are dispensed with fairly quickly, and judges take a more practical and pragmatic approach to trying to reach the best decision consistent with the rule of law.
Senator GRASSLEY. I am going to go to an issue that Senator Kennedy left off with regarding the Grove City case. And I have the memo that was involved in this issue before me. And I see the memo being a summary of former Education Secretary Bell’s views on this issue. But Senator Kennedy left out what your assessment was on it, and you wrote these words: ‘‘As a practical matter, however, I do not think the administration can revisit the issue at this late date.’’
Can you tell us what your position was in this memo? And Mr. Chairman, I would like to have this entire memo submitted for the record.

Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be admitted as part of our record.
Judge ROBERTS. The issue was the—in the Grove City case, the Court had said that receipt of financial aid by students triggered coverage under the civil rights statutes, limited to the admissions office, the admissions policies. The Civil Rights Restoration Act changed that result to say that the limitation was not to the admissions office but applied more generally to the institution.
Secretary Bell submitted a proposal. He said, well, if it’s going to apply more generally to the institution, then the trigger of simply having students who receive financial aid shouldn’t be enough. And the position that we took in response to Secretary Bell’s proposal was no, that we weren’t going to revisit it. We had argued earlier in Grove City that financial aid was enough to trigger coverage and we weren’t going to revisit that question. The position was that coverage of the entire institution based on receipt of financial aid was appropriate.
Senator GRASSLEY. So Senator Kennedy’s words were not quoting you but quoting words that Secretary Bell had in this memo, and you were reacting to those.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s, again, 23-some years ago. But my recollection is that that was his proposal. Our response was that, no, we’re not going to do that, we’re not going to change the position we’ve taken in light of the new legislation.
Senator GRASSLEY. Some outside groups have claimed that you are hostile to civil rights. Others have suggested, in my view incorrectly, that you have an off-the-mark view of the Voting Rights Act. I believe these allegations to be inaccurate, and I would like for you to set the record straight. As you may know, I have long been a supporter of the Voting Rights Act. I appeared at a news conference with Senator Dole and Kennedy and some others in 1982 with that compromise that you have referred to. The Voting Rights Act has had a very significant impact on racial discrimination, probably more than anything else that Congress has done since the adoption of the Civil War Amendments.
Your critics take issue with some of your memos which outline the arguments in the debate over whether Section 2 should have an effects test or an intent test. Specifically, there was a debate in Congress over concerns that the effects test could lead to legal requirements that racial quotas be mandated for legislatures and other elected bodies. Ultimately, the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized with a provision expressly prohibiting parts from requiring racial quotas. We were able to craft a good compromise that gave greater protection to minority voters while not requiring quotas.
Judge Roberts, could you tell us what your role was as an assistant to Attorney General Smith in developing the Reagan policy on the Voting Rights Act?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, President Reagan’s policy and the Attorney General’s policy was to support the longest extension of the Voting Rights Act in history without change. Some in the Congress wanted to amend the Voting Rights Act Section 2 to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Mobile v. Bolden. And that’s what the debate was about, whether it should be an intent test under Section 2 or an effects test. Everybody agreed that Section 5, the pre-

184
clearance provision, which applied to jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, had an effects test and should continue to have an effects test.
The debate was about Section 2 and whether it should be an intent test or an effects test. But there was no disagreement among President Reagan, Attorney General Smith. Those of us on Attorney General Smith’s staff, like myself, thought that the protection of the right to vote was critical, that the Voting Rights Act had been extraordinarily effective in preserving that right and should be extended. The debate was solely over whether or not Section 2 should be changed. And Senator Dole, working with other Members of the Senate, crafted a compromise that resolved that dispute. As you said, it put an effects test in Section 2, put in additional language to guard against the sort of proportional representation that was certainly the concern of Attorney General Smith and President Reagan, and that was enacted into law with the President’s support.
But there was no disagreement about the critical nature of the right to vote, the notion that it was preservative of all other rights, and the question was simply about how it should be extended, whether extended as is or extended with the change that was enacted under the compromise.
Senator GRASSLEY. My time is just about out so I will ask a very short question. During your tenure at the Solicitor General’s office, didn’t you sign on to a number of briefs that urged the Supreme Court to adopt a broad interpretation of the Voting Rights Act, its new requirements, and to require expansive remedies when States violate the Act? And didn’t some of those briefs take the same side as the ACLU, the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. It was the responsibility of the Justice Department and, before the Supreme Court, of course, the Office of the Solicitor General to enforce the civil rights laws, in particular the Voting Rights Act, as vigorously as possible. And that’s what we did.
Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Biden? Senator BIDEN. Thank you very much. Hey, Judge, how are you? Judge ROBERTS. Fine, thank you. Senator BIDEN. You know, to continue your baseball analogy, I would much rather be pitching to Arthur Branch, sitting behind you there, on ‘‘Law & Order,’’ than you. It is like pitching to Ken Griffey. I am a little concerned here. I would like you to switch places with Thompson. I know I know as much as he does; I don’t know about you. [Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. But Judge, look. I am going to try to cut through some stuff here if I can. I said yesterday this shouldn’t be a game of gotcha—you know, we shouldn’t be playing a game, the folks have a right to know what you think, you are there for life, they don’t get to—this is the democratic moment. They don’t get a chance to say, you know, I wish I’d known that about that guy, I

185
would have picked up the phone and called my Senator and said Vote No. Or Vote Yes. Whichever.
And so what I would like to do is stick with your analogy a little bit because everybody has used it—baseball. By the way, to continue that metaphor, you hit a home run yesterday. I mean, you know, everybody—I got home and I got on the train and people were saying, ‘‘Oh, he likes baseball, huh? ’’ Seriously. The conductors, people on the train. And it is an apt metaphor because, you know, you just call balls and strikes, call them as you see them, straight up.
But as you well know—I would like to explore that philosophy a little bit because you got asked that question by Senator Hatch, about what is your philosophy, and the baseball metaphor is used again. As you know, in major league baseball, they have a rule— Rule 2.00 defines the strike zone. It basically says from the shoulders to the knees. And the only question about judges is, ‘‘do they have good eyesight or not? ’’ They don’t get to change the strike zone. They don’t get to say that was down around the ankles, you know, and I think it was a strike. They don’t get to do that.
But you are in a very different position as a Supreme Court Justice. As you pointed out, some places of the Constitution define the strike zone—two-thirds of the Senators must vote, you must be an American citizen, to the chagrin of Arnold Schwarzenegger, to be President of the United States—I mean born in America to be a President of the United States. They are all—the strike zone is set out. But as you pointed out in the question of Senator Hatch, I think you said unreasonable search and seizure; what constitutes unreasonable?
So, as much as I respect your metaphor, it is not very apt because you get to determine the strike zone. What is unreasonable? Your strike zone on reasonable or unreasonable may be very different from another judge’s view of what is reasonable or unreasonable search and seizure.
And the same thing prevails for a lot of other parts of the Constitution. The one that we are all talking about and everybody here from left, right, and center is concerned about is the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment. It doesn’t define it. All the things we debate about here, and the Court debates, the 5–4 decisions, they are almost all on issues that are ennobling phrases in the Constitution that the Founders never set a strike zone for. You get to go back and decide. You get to go back and decide, like in the Michael H. case, do you look at a narrow or a broad right that has been respected? That is a strike zone.
So, as Chris Matthews last night said, let’s play hardball here. And I was, like, it is a little dangerous to play hardball with you, like I said. But really and truly, it seems to me maybe we can get at this a different way.
The explicit references in the Constitution are, you know, there is nothing anyone would suspect you or any other judge would do anything about. You wouldn’t say, you know, that’s a really bad treaty they’re voting on, so you ought to make it require 75 votes in the Senate. You can’t do that. But again, you know, as Justice Marshall said, and I quoted him yesterday, he said that—Marshall’s prescription that the Constitution endure through the

186
ages—I might add, without having to be amended over and over and over again. After the first ten amendments, we haven’t done this very much in the last 230 years.
So, many of the Constitution’s most important provisions are not the precise rules that I have referenced earlier. And sometimes, the principles everyone agrees on are part of the Constitution are, as the late Chief Justice, your mentor, said, ‘‘tacit postulates.’’ He used that, as you know, in a case just before you got there, Nevada v. Hall. But he used the phrase ‘‘tacit postulates.’’ He said that these tacit postulates are as much ingrained in the fabric of the document as its express provisions. And he went on to conclude that—this case is not particularly relevant, but the point is, I think. The case in which Chief Justice Rehnquist made this vital point was about States’ rights and language that didn’t speak directly to them in the Constitution. And he concluded the answer was a rule he was able to infer from the overall constitutional plan.
So Judge, you are going to be an inferer. You are not going to be an umpire. Umpires do not infer. They do not get to infer. Every Justice has to infer. So I want to figure out how you infer. I want to figure out how you go about this. So let me get right to it.
And I want to use the Ginsburg rule. I notice I am quoted all the time about Ginsburg—‘‘Judge, you don’t answer that question.’’ I might point out that Justice Ginsburg, and I submit this for the record, commented specifically on 27 cases, 27 specific cases. I will just speak to a couple of them here.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.
Senator BIDEN. I thank you very much. Now, you have already said to the Chairman that you agree that there is a right to privacy. And you said that the Supreme Court found such a right, in part, in the 14th Amendment. My question is do you agree that there is—not what settled law is. What do you think? Do you agree that there is a right of privacy to be found in the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment? Judge ROBERTS. I do, Senator. I think that the Court’s expressions, and I think if my reading of the precedent is correct, I think every Justice on the Court believes that to some extent or another. Liberty is not limited to freedom from physical restraint. It does cover areas, as you said, such as privacy, and it’s not protected only in procedural terms but it is protected substantively as well. Again, I think every member of the Court subscribes to that proposition. If they agree with Bolling v. Sharpe, as I am sure all of them do, they are subscribing to that proposition to some extent or another. Senator BIDEN. Do you think there is a liberty right of privacy that extends to women in the Constitution? Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator BIDEN. In the 14th Amendment? Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator BIDEN. Now, I assumed you would answer it that way. Let me suggest to you also that I asked—I asked Justice—or I am not sure whether I asked or one of our colleagues asked Justice Ginsburg the question of whether or not it would be a ball or a strike if in fact a State passed a law prohibiting abortion. And she said that’s a foul ball. They can’t do that. And let me quote her.

She said, in response to Senator, former—I was going to say ‘‘Brownback’’—Senator Brown when he was here, when she was up, of Colorado. She said, quote: ‘‘Abortion prohibition by the State controls women and denies them full autonomy and full equality with men.’’ It would be unconstitutional.
What is your view, according to the Ginsburg rule? Judge ROBERTS. Well, that is in an area where I think I should not respond. Senator BIDEN. Why? Judge ROBERTS. Because— Senator BIDEN. You said you would abide by the Ginsburg rule. Judge ROBERTS. Then-Judge Ginsburg and now Justice Ginsburg explained that she thought she was at greater liberty to discuss her writings. She’d written extensively on that area and I think that’s why she felt at greater liberty to talk about those cases. In other areas, where she had not written, her response was that it was inappropriate to comment. In particular, I remember her response in the Mayer and the Harris cases. She said those are the Court’s precedents; I have no agenda to overrule them, and I will leave it at that. And I think that’s important to adhere to that. Let me explain very briefly why. It’s because if these questions come before me, either on the court on which I now sit or, if I am confirmed, on the Supreme Court, I need to decide those questions with an open mind on the basis of the arguments presented, on the basis of the record presented in the case, and on the basis of the rule of law, including the precedents of the Court, and not on the basis of any commitments during the confirmation process. The litigants have a right to expect that of the judges or Justices before whom they appear. And it’s not just Justice Ginsburg who adhered to that rule. I’ve gone back and read— Senator BIDEN. Well, she obviously didn’t adhere to it with regard to— Judge ROBERTS. Well, I explained why she felt at liberty to comment— Senator BIDEN. Well, how is that different? That, I would suggest, Judge, is a distinction without a difference in terms of litigants, the way you just explained it. Does a litigant in fact say because a judge wrote about it and then spoke to it as a judge that somehow I am going to be put at a disadvantage before that judge on the court? That is a stretch, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s how Judge Ginsburg explained it at her nomination hearings. She said she could talk about the issues on which she had written. Senator BIDEN. Did that make sense to you? Judge ROBERTS. I think it does make sense that she can be questioned about the articles that she’d written because they raised certain questions and she felt at liberty to discuss those. I think it’s something entirely different if you talk about an area that could come before the Court. This is an area that cases are pending before the Court and they will be pending in the future. Senator BIDEN. Well, let’s try some things she didn’t write about that she talked about. Let’s see if you can talk about them.

One is she talked about Moore v. East Cleveland. You are much more familiar with the case than I am. That is a case where the city came along—and I am going to do this shorthand in the interest of time—and said a grandma living in an apartment with her blood grandchildren who were cousins, not brothers, violated the law. And the Chief said, in the minority opinion, your mentor, he said, the interest that grandmother may have ‘‘in permanently sharing a single kitchen and a suite of contiguous rooms with some of her relatives simply does not rise to [the level of a constitutional right]. To equate this interest with fundamental decisions to marry and to bear and raise children is to extend the limited substantive contours [of the Constitution] beyond recognition.’’
Do you agree with his statement? Judge ROBERTS. You know, I have no quarrel with the majority’s determination and— Senator BIDEN. Not my question, Judge. Chairman SPECTER. Let him flesh his answers out. Judge ROBERTS. I understand that. And I’m concerned about ramifications in which the issue could come up. But I have no quarrel with the majority’s determination— Senator BIDEN. Justice Ginsburg answered the question. She never wrote about it. She answered it specifically. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think— Senator BIDEN. She went on to say that—and let me quote. She said, ‘‘Yes, he goes on—’’ This is quoting Justice Ginsburg. ‘‘He goes on to say that ‘history counsels caution and restraint,’ and I agree with that. He then says—this is referring to the majority opinion— ‘but it does not counsel abandonment,’ abandonment of the notion that people have a right to make certain fundamental decisions about their lives without interference from the State. And what he next says is ‘history doesn’t counsel abandonment, nor does it require what the city is urging here,’—cutting off the family right at the first boundary, which is the nuclear family. He rejects that. I’m taking the position I have all the time—’’ and she goes on to say— She says uh-uh. She thinks your old boss was dead wrong. She said so. And she said the majority was dead right. Ginsburg rule. What do you think? She never wrote about it. Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I think nominees have to draw the line where they’re comfortable. It’s a matter of some— Senator BIDEN. Well, you are admitting you are not applying the Ginsburg rule. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Biden, let him finish. Senator BIDEN. I don’t have much time. But go ahead. Judge ROBERTS. It’s a matter of great importance not only to potential Justices but to judges. We’re sensitive to the need to maintain the independence and integrity of the Court. I think it’s vitally important that nominees, to use Justice Ginsburg’s words, no hints, no forecasts, no previews. They go on the Court not as a delegate from this Committee with certain commitments laid out and how they’re going to approach cases. They go on the Court as Justices who will approach cases with an open mind and decide those cases in light of the arguments presented, the record presented, and the rule of law. And the litigants before them have a right to expect that and to have the appearance of that as well.

That has been the approach that all of the Justices have taken. Senator BIDEN. That is not true, Judge. Justice Ginsburg violated that rule, according to you. Justice Ginsburg said precisely what positions she agreed on. Did she in fact somehow compromise herself when she answered that question? Judge ROBERTS. She said no hints, no forecasts— Senator BIDEN. No, no. Judge ROBERTS.—no previews. Senator BIDEN. Judge, she specifically, in response to a question whether or not she agreed with the majority or minority opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland, said explicitly, I agree with the majority. And here’s what the majority said and I agree with it. My question to you is, do you agree with it or not? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I do know, Senator, that in numerous other cases—because I read the transcript— Senator BIDEN. So did I, Judge. Judge ROBERTS.—she took the position that she should not comment. Justice O’Connor took the same position. She was asked about a particular case— Senator BIDEN. Aw, Judge, Judge— Judge ROBERTS. She said, It’s not correct for me to comment. Now, there’s a reason for that, Senator. Senator BIDEN. But you are going from— Chairman SPECTER. Wait a minute, Senator Biden. He has not finished his answer. Senator BIDEN. He’s filibustering, Senator. [Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. But okay, go ahead. Chairman SPECTER. No, he’s not. No, he’s not. Judge ROBERTS. That’s a bad word, Senator. Senator BIDEN. That’s what we do, too. Go ahead. Go ahead and continue not to answer. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Senator, my answer is that the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court requires that nominees before this Committee for a position on that Court not forecast, give predictions, give hints about how they might rule in cases that might come before the Court. Senator BIDEN. I got that. Did Justice Ginsburg give a hint? Judge ROBERTS. I’m not going to comment on whether or not a particular nominee adhered to the approach that they announced. Senator BIDEN. Well, let’s make it clear. She did not. Let’s stipulate she did not adhere to the approach. I don’t have time because we don’t have as much time, but I could list for you for half an hour the questions she answered, the questions Kennedy, Souter— all the Justices, almost, with one exception, answered specific questions, which you are not answering and— Judge ROBERTS. Senator— Senator BIDEN. Let me go on to my next question. Violence Against Women—and I realize it is a bit of a hobby horse for me since I wrote the legislation, and I know people say they wrote things. I mean, I actually did write that my little old self, with my staff. And no one liked it, I might add, at first—women’s groups or anybody else.

But in 1999, you said, in response to a question—you were on a show. It was 1999. You were talking about a number of things, and you said, and I quote, ‘‘You know, we’ve gotten to a point these days where we think the only way we can show we’re serious about a problem is if we pass a Federal law, whether it’s the Violence Against Women Act or anything else. The fact of the matter is conditions are different in different States, and State laws are more relevant. It is, I think, exactly the right term. More in tune to different situations in New York as opposed to Minnesota, and that’s what the Federal system is based upon.’’
Judge, tell me how a guy beating up his wife in Minnesota is in any different condition in New York.
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I was not speaking specifically to any piece of legislation there. That was making a very—
Senator BIDEN. Well, you mention Violence Against Women, don’t you?
Judge ROBERTS. That was the issue that had come up on the show, and the general issue that was being addressed is a question of federalism. I think it was part of the genius of the Founding Fathers to establish a Federal system with a national government to address issues of national concern; State and local government more close to the people to address issues of State and local concern; obviously, issues of overlap as well. I was not expressing a view on any particular piece of legislation. And I think the statement you read—
Senator BIDEN. Well, let me ask you— Judge ROBERTS.—confirms that. Senator BIDEN. Okay. Judge, is gender discrimination, as you have written in a memo, a ‘‘perceived’’ problem or is it a real problem? Judge ROBERTS. The memo you talked about, Senator, I’ve had a chance to look at it. It concerned a 50-State inventory of particular proposals to address it. ‘‘Perceived’’ was not being used in that case to suggest that there was any doubt that there is gender discrimination and that it should be addressed. What it was referring to was a vast inventory, and I was not sure if the particular proposals in each case were supported in every State of the 50State survey that was involved. Of course, gender discrimination is a serious problem. It’s a particular concern of mine and always has been. I grew up with three sisters, all of whom work outside the home. I married a lawyer who works outside the home. I have a young daughter who I hope will have all of the opportunities available to her without regard to any gender discrimination. There is no suggestion in anything that I’ve written of any resistance to the basic idea of full citizenship without regard to gender. Senator BIDEN. Let me ask you a question then, Judge, and I am glad to hear that. Do you think that if a State law distinguishes between a right that your daughter may have and your son may have or your wife may have or your sister may have and your brother may have that the Supreme Court should engage in heightened scrutiny, not just look and see whether or not it makes any sense, but take an extra special look? You and I know the terms, but the public listening here—the Supreme Court has said since

1971, you know, when a State passes a law that treats in any way different a woman than a man, there may be a rationale for it, but the Supreme Court is going to take a very close look—not strict scrutiny, which means you can hardly ever get over that bar, like race, but can take a heightened look, they are going to look at it more closely. Do you think that that needs to be done, that the Constitution calls for that?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator, I do. And I, again, always have. The confusion is in the use of the term. There are those who use the term ‘‘heightened scrutiny’’ to refer to what you just called ‘‘strict scrutiny,’’ which is generally limited to issues of race or similar issues. The discrimination on the basis of gender, distinctions on the basis of gender, is subject to what the Supreme Court has called ‘‘intermediate scrutiny.’’ There has to be a substantial Government interest—an important Government interest and a substantial connection in the discrimination. But the Supreme Court’s equal protection analysis has three tiers now—
Senator BIDEN. I understand. My time is running out. I would love to hear the explanation of the three tiers, but let’s stick to this one for just a second. Then explain to me what you meant 10 years after the decision laying out this level of scrutiny when you wrote in a 1981 memo to your boss, you wrote that gender ‘‘is not a criterion calling for heightened judicial review.’’ What did you mean by that?
Judge ROBERTS. Referring to what you called strict scrutiny. Senator BIDEN. He didn’t know the difference between heightened and strict? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I was about to lay it out, and you said you didn’t want to hear about it. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Strict scrutiny is the— Senator BIDEN. No, I know what that is. I wonder what you meant by— Chairman SPECTER. Senator Biden, let him finish his answer. Senator BIDEN. But I have no time left, Mr. Chairman. I understand the answer. [Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. I understand the Supreme Court has three levels of scrutiny. My point was, in the context of this memo, in the context of this memorandum, the question was whether or not the Court should, in fact, have a heightened scrutiny. Judge ROBERTS. And, Senator, the memorandum is using ‘‘heightened scrutiny’’ the way you used ‘‘strict scrutiny,’’ which is the scrutiny that’s limited to the basis of race. The gender discrimination is, as you know, subject to what is called ‘‘intermediate scrutiny,’’ and that is not what the memo is referring to with respect to heightened scrutiny. It’s referring to the strict scrutiny that’s restricted to issues of race and ethnicity. Senator BIDEN. Well, I will come back to that in the second round because that is not my reading of what you said. But let me get on another issue here, again, in the sex discrimination area. The Attorney General for Civil Rights, a former Delawarean, not viewed as a darling of the left, Bradford Reynolds, decided that the Federal Government should take action against the State of Ken-

tucky, and they said that there is a very strong record that the Kentucky prison system discriminates against female prisoners. And I am going to finish my whole question. And you wrote to the Attorney General, ‘‘I recommend you do not approve intervention in this case.’’ And then you set out three reasons why you shouldn’t approve of it—not that there wasn’t discrimination. You said, one, that private plaintiffs are already bringing suit; secondly, the United States’ argument would have been based upon giving higher scrutiny to claims of gender classification; and, thirdly, that we need to be concerned about tight prison budgets, you say, and you go on to explain that if, in fact, you hold them to the same standard, they may get rid of the program for the men.
Now, explain to me your thinking there. That seems to me— Judge ROBERTS. I’m sorry. What was the date of the memo, Senator? Senator BIDEN. The date of the memo was February 12, 1982. I will give you a copy, ask them to bring you down a copy of the memo. Judge ROBERTS. I can’t elaborate on—I can’t elaborate beyond what’s in the memo. I just— Senator BIDEN. Well, I hope you don’t still hold that view, man. I mean, if the idea that you’re not going to—that a conservative civil rights—the head of the Civil Rights Division in the Reagan administration says it is pretty clear Kentucky is discriminating against women in their prison system, and you say, in effect, that may be but, look, we shouldn’t move on it, I recommend we don’t do anything about this, and the reason we shouldn’t do anything this is three-fold: one, private citizens already went ahead and filed suit on this; number two, if, in fact, you go ahead and do this, they may do away with the system for the men because there’s tight budgets—and I forget the third one. You now have the memo. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I have the memo and see that one of the areas that you mentioned I say that—and this is to the Attorney General, and I say the reason we shouldn’t do this is because ‘‘you have publicly opposed such approaches.’’ So, again, it would have been— Senator BIDEN. It was only his idea, then? I mean, you were just protecting him so he wouldn’t be inconsistent? Judge ROBERTS. I was a lawyer on his staff, and according to this memorandum—and, again, I don’t remember anything independently of this 23 years ago. But the memorandum suggests, a staff lawyer to his boss, that this is inconsistent with what you have said. And, again, I guess I would regard that as good staff work rather than anything else. Senator BIDEN. I regard it as very poor staff work, with all due respect, Judge, because it seems to me you insert your views very strongly in here. You don’t say you said this. You say, ‘‘And, by the way, there’s other reasons why we shouldn’t do this. Assume you’re saying you wouldn’t go this route before, but I want to give you more ammunition here, Brad. Private plaintiffs have done this; it is inconsistent with three themes in your judicial restraints effort: equal protection claim, relief of a well-involved judicial inference, et cetera; and, by the way, the end result may be with tight budgets they may do away with this.’’

My time is running out. I will come back to this. I hope you get a chance to study it between now and the time we get back to the second round.
The next question. You know, I find it fascinating, this whole thing about Title IX and whether or not by Title IX—you and I know what we are talking about, but for the public at large who really has an interest in all of this as well, the issue was whether or not when a student gets aid, whether or not it only goes to the admissions piece of it.
Now, you said something that was accurate but I don’t think fulsome to Senator Kennedy, and correct me if I am wrong. You said, look, we were arguing that it did apply—Title IX did apply. If a student got aid, it applied to the university. That was one of the questions, whether or not you have no application or a narrow application. And you argued that it should apply to the admissions process.
But there is a second issue in that case, and the second issue is: Do you apply it narrowly only to do with the admissions policy or do you apply it to if they are discriminating in dormitories?
I got your answer on the first part. You thought it should apply, at least narrowly. Were you arguing that it should apply broadly? And this was before—let me make it clear. The district court, I say to my friends—because I had forgotten this. The district court had ruled that this only applies to admissions, and there was a question. The Chairman of Reagan’s Commission on Civil Rights said we should get in on the side of the plaintiff here, and we should appeal this to the Supreme Court or to a higher court and say, ‘‘No, no, this applies across the board, this applies if you don’t put money in sports programs, you don’t put money in dormitories, et cetera.’’
What was your position on Reagan’s Civil Rights Chairman, Clarence Pendleton, suggesting that we appeal the decision of the circuit court narrowly applying it only to the admissions office?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I was a staff lawyer. I didn’t have a position. The administration had a position, and the administration’s position was the two-fold position you’ve set forth. First, Title IX applies. Second, it applies to the office, the admissions office.
Senator BIDEN. Only to the office, right? It applies narrowly. Judge ROBERTS. The question— Chairman SPECTER. Now, wait a minute. Let him finish his answer, Senator Biden. Senator BIDEN. The answers are misleading, with all due respect. Chairman SPECTER. Well, they— Senator BIDEN. Let me get— Chairman SPECTER. Wait a minute, wait a minute. They may be misleading, but they are his answers. Senator BIDEN. Okay, fine. Chairman SPECTER. You may finish, Judge Roberts. Senator BIDEN. Fire away, Judge. At least I am misunderstanding your answers. Judge ROBERTS. With respect, they are my answers, and, with respect, they’re not misleading. They’re accurate. This is a— Senator BIDEN. I have now a minute and 45 seconds.

Judge ROBERTS.—dispute that was 20-some years ago. The effort was to interpret what this body, Congress, meant. The administration position was Federal financial aid triggers coverage. It’s limited to the admissions office. The United States Supreme Court agreed on both counts.
Senator BIDEN. I understand that. Judge ROBERTS. So I would say that the administration correctly interpreted the intent of Congress in enacting that legislation. Senator BIDEN. Well, let me read what you wrote in that memo. You said you ‘‘strongly agree.’’ Now, when my staff sends me a memo saying, ‘‘Senator, I recommend you do the following. . .and I strongly agree,’’ that usually is a pretty good indication what they think. Now, maybe they don’t. Maybe they just like to use the word ‘‘strongly.’’ They said ‘‘strongly agree.’’ It usually means they agree. Number one. Number two, you went on to say, and I quote, that if you have the broad interpretation, it will be—the Federal Government will be rummaging ‘‘willy-nilly through institutions.’’ So you expressed not only that you strongly agree, but you thought that if you gave them this power to broadly interpret it, to apply to dormitories and all these others things, that they would willy-nilly—they would rummage willy-nilly through institutions. It seems to me you had a pretty strong view back then. Maybe you don’t have it now. Judge ROBERTS. Well, and the Supreme Court’s conclusion was that that administration position was a correct reading of the law that this body passed. So if the view was strongly held, it was because I thought that was a correct reading of the law. The Supreme Court concluded that it was a correct reading of the law. Senator BIDEN. Thanks, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. We will recess now until 2:15. [Whereupon, at 12:48 p.m., the Committee recessed, to reconvene at 2:15 p.m., this same day.] AFTERNOON SESSION [2:16 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will resume the confirmation hearing. I have been asked to delay by two minutes the starting time so the electronic media can make appropriate introductions, and then I have also been told that my watch is a minute fast, and so we are going to correct all those miscues. For 30 minutes, Senator Kyl. Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There are several preliminary things I would like to do and then get into a couple of questions that I wanted to ask you, Judge. First, to my colleagues, with reference to some questions that attacked policy positions of the Reagan administration when you were working there as a lawyer, Judge Roberts, I tend to agree with you that it wouldn’t be appropriate in your role as a current judge, not to mention your service on the Supreme Court, to be put in the position of defending policy positions of the previous administration. But to the extent my colleagues would like to engage in that debate, probably not in this forum, I would be happy to accommodate them in that matter.

Judge, as to your role, I appreciate, frankly, your candor and the clarity of what you have said, and you have said a great deal here. Obviously, you have drawn the line at issues that may come before the Court, but I think you have already added to what we knew about your approach to judging. That is the key question here, and I appreciate what you have added to that, and I will get into a little bit more of that in a moment.
There are a couple of other items that I would like to clarify. Our colleague, Senator Biden, had engaged you in a colloquy regarding some testimony given by Justice Ginsburg and he suggested that Justice Ginsburg was asked about a specific case called Moore v. City of Cleveland and that even though she had not written about that case, she volunteered to speak about it.
Now, I think, appropriately, you are not going to be a judge or umpire in this case as to whether she did or did not exceed the rule that she set down. That would be highly inappropriate. But I would like to correct the record because that isn’t what transpired.
I won’t read the entire transcript here, but would ask that the relevant portions be inserted in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.
But just to set the background, she is testifying here in response to questions by Senator Hatch and she said, ‘‘I have said to this Committee that the finest expression of that idea of individual autonomy and personhood and of the obligation of the State to leave people alone and to make basic decisions about their personal life, Justice Harlan’s dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman.’’ Senator Hatch said, ‘‘Right.’’
And then Judge Ginsburg said, ‘‘After Poe v. Ullman, I think the most eloquent statement of it, recognizing that it has difficulties, and it certainly does, is by Justice Powell in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, the case concerning the grandmother who wanted to live with her grandson. Those two cases more than any others, Poe v. Ullman, which was the forerunner of the Griswold case, and Moore v. City of East Cleveland, explain the concept far better than I can.’’ And then there are other things that occur in the transcript.
My point here is to note that she was not asked a specific question about this case. She volunteered it as one of two cases that had interesting language that expressed what she wanted to express with regard to the principle of individual autonomy and personhood.
And then further down in the transcript, she said, ‘‘Senator Hatch, I agree with the Moore v. City of East Cleveland statement of Justice Powell.’’ She goes on to describe how he reached it. And later, Senator Hatch said, ‘‘You mean with the position of Justice Powell?’’ And Justice Ginsburg said, ‘‘The position I have stated here. You asked me how I justify saying that Roe has two underpinnings, the equal dignity of the woman idea and the personhood idea of individual autonomy and decision making. I point to those two decision opinions as supplying the essential underpinning.’’
And then she said, ‘‘In taking the position I have in all of my writings on this subject, I must associate myself with Justice Powell’s statements. Otherwise, I could not have written what I did.’’

The point is, this is a matter on which she had written extensively and, therefore, it is not the case, (A) that she was asked about the case and was responding, but rather, she brought the decision up; and (B) she used it to illustrate what she had already written about extensively. So I think that will help to clarify the record. We will put those portions of the transcript in the record and people can judge for themselves whether she violated the rule which she has laid down, a rule which you subscribe to with respect to giving hints or ideas about how you might rule in future cases.
If you would like to comment on any of that, you certainly may, but I doubt that you would want to do so.
The other item that I would like to insert in the record is a memorandum, and this was discussed, I believe, in Senator Biden’s questioning, regarding a memorandum dated February 12, 1982 addressing proposed intervention in Canterino v. Wilson, and there were excerpts of that memorandum read to you and you were asked to respond. I would like to have the entire memorandum inserted in the record at this point so that people can judge for themselves.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.
Senator KYL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Now, Judge Roberts, one of the themes in the statements of my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, yesterday was an expression of concern that you might, as a Supreme Court Justice, undo what they described as progress. This progress is represented for my colleagues by some of the Court’s decisions over recent decades and also by some legislation. My colleagues expressed a heartfelt concern for preserving this progress. Another one of my Democratic colleagues endorsed a standard that a past member of this Committee articulated for evaluating nominees. He asked, will the nominee expand or contract freedom? You recall that. Progress and freedom. I think any American would find it quite difficult to quibble with these two ideals. I do not think that you will find a Member of the Senate who would not express support for both progress and freedom, and for many of the specific reforms that have been discussed. But as I thought about those two words last night and about my colleagues’ genuine concern for protecting what they understand as progress and freedom, I began to ask myself what those two words actually mean in the context of your nomination and the Court’s function more generally. When can we say that a particular decision by the Supreme Court expands or contracts progress or freedom? Actually, it is a little more complicated as you stop and think about it. For example, earlier this year, the Supreme Court issued a decision that allows the government to take one private individual’s property to transfer that property to another private individual or entity. The Court’s majority held that such an action is consistent with the Constitution’s public use requirement for takings of property so long as there is some indirect benefit to the government, so long as, for example, the government expects to receive more tax revenues from the second party’s use of the property.

197
All of the most commonly described liberal members of the Supreme Court joined in the opinion, and I am certain that the types of involuntary government-engineered development projects that this decision allows will be viewed by many as progress. I am not so sure. Is it really progress for one more politically influential private party to be able to use the government’s power of eminent domain to take another, less politically connected, individual’s property that this is constitutional so long as the government anticipates increased tax revenues? I don’t think this precedent represents an advance of either progress or freedom, in other words.
In 1975, the Court issued an important decision giving public school students the right to a hearing before they are suspended for disciplinary decisions, and the net effect of these decisions, as many school administrators and teachers have told me, has been to make school discipline much harder to implement and enforce. The procedures, for example, for removing a disruptive student from the classroom have become sufficiently involved that in many cases, the school simply doesn’t do it. The student remains in class and the other students’ learning suffers.
The writer David Frum has described this line of Supreme Court decisions as the ‘‘Bad Kid’s Magna Carta.’’ Many older teachers, in particular, can describe the decline in school discipline and order that followed from these decisions, and I am not sure that even though many would subscribe to the decision of the Court, that it really represents an advance of freedom or progress, especially if most children are less free in their school environment.
In 2003, the Supreme Court issued a decision that effectively prevents the government from outlawing child pornography if that pornography is made with computer-generated images of children. The effect of these decisions is that a whole class of child pornography effectively can’t be prohibited. Many of those who work in the criminal justice system, particularly those familiar with sex offenders and their mindset, have expressed grave concern about the decision. They believe that the existence and availability of this kind of pornography can affect the behavior of certain sex offenders, that it sends them the message that their impulses are not shameful, but rather that they are shared by others and can be indulged.
Again, I have no doubt that some view this decision as an advance of freedom, and again, I would disagree. A world where these types of sexual crimes occur with frequency is a world where parents are constantly afraid for their children, afraid to let them play outside alone, to go outside of their sight, even afraid to let them go on the Internet, and I don’t see this as an advance of freedom.
The conclusion that I have, and there are other decisions we could point to, but what I have come to conclude is that it is not your function as a judge to decide how best to advance progress and freedom, that these are decisions that all Americans need to be involved in making, sometimes through their elected representatives. The formula for creating progress and freedom in society is not predetermined, but rather both of these values require a balance of competing values. Society needs order and stability on the one hand, individual autonomy on the other: there are few absolutes.

198
So really the question here is how you view your role as a judge with respect to this concept of advancing freedom and progress, especially since you cannot, for the most part, choose what cases come before you to decide. What is your take on your role if you were to become the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court in considering this notion of advancing freedom and progress through your decision making?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, judges and Justices do have a side in these disputes. They need to be on the side of the Constitution, and in most of these areas, what the Constitution provides is that these sorts of policy debates, which approach is better suited to promote freedom or to promote progress are vested in the legislative branch. There are areas where the Constitution sets aside certain areas, in the Bill of Rights and other protections of liberty, and says that these areas are beyond the reach of the policymaking branches and judges and Justices have the responsibility to enforce those provisions in the Constitution. But outside of that, judges and Justices should not take sides in these disputes.
I think people on both sides need to know that if they go to the Supreme Court that they’re going to be on a level playing field, that the judge is going to interpret the law, that the judge is going to apply the Constitution and not take sides in their dispute. That’s what this body is for in Congress and in the State legislatures, to resolve those types of policy disputes. So long as the resolution is consistent with the Constitution, that’s what the judges are there to ensure, and so long as they ensure that, the Framers’ notion was that freedom and progress would be advanced by allowing those decisions to be made by the people’s elected representatives.
Senator KYL. I appreciate that. You said in response to another question, you used the phrase ‘‘as applied.’’ Most of the lawyers appreciate what you meant by that, but I wonder if you could elucidate, particularly for those who are not learned in the law, what the difference is between dealing with a case, an issue of constitutionality, per se, or an ‘‘as applied’’ context, and how it is possible, for example, in Case No. 1 to uphold the constitutionality of a law on its face, and yet in Case No. 2, a court comes down a few years later to declare that in that situation, the statute is unconstitutional as it is applied to the facts of that case. How can that be?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the distinction is a basic one in constitutional law. If you have a facial challenge to a law, as we call it, or a per se challenge might be another way to put it, you’re basically saying the law is unconstitutional without regard to the facts of the case, without regard to the record, whatever the application might be, whoever the parties challenging it might be, there’s something about the law so fundamentally flawed that it’s unconstitutional however it’s going to be applied. That’s a fairly narrow category of cases.
The other category is so-called as-applied challenge. You have a law that you know is not facially unconstitutional, but it may be applied in an unconstitutional manner. An easy example, you have a normal statute that’s perfectly constitutional. If it’s applied in a discriminatory manner, it may be unconstitutional as applied in that case. If it can be applied in a constitutional manner, you know, so long as the facts are a certain way, and if the facts turn

199
out in the record not to meet those requirements, then it can be unconstitutional as applied, and in those situations you do need to know what the record is, you do need to know what the facts are, because the challenge might be, this law may be fine for other cases, but when you apply it to this case, when you apply it to this record or these facts, then it’s unconstitutional. So a statute that is constitutional on its face can always be applied in an unconstitutional way, and so you can’t give a categorical determination that there is no way in which that statute could ever be unconstitutionally applied.
Senator KYL. This is another reason why, when you are asked, ‘‘Well, would you agree that a certain decision is a good decision and should be maintained as part of our jurisprudence and so on?’’ In addition to not wanting to give a hint as to how you might rule on a case, to some extent it is impossible to say because you do not have the facts of the case before you and the facts of Case A could cause you to render a different decision than the facts of Case B.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s right, and particular precedence obviously could be applied to variations on the fact situation that gave rise to that precedent, and sometimes those facts lead to a different results, sometimes those facts don’t. And it makes sense to continue to apply it in a particular manner. But again—and I think most judges are of this view—that the facts are a critical part of the resolution of any dispute.
Senator KYL. I know perhaps to non-lawyers this can cause frustration, ‘‘just tell me one way or the other,’’ but judges have got to be fair to make sure that they do not treat all cases the same because the differences of fact could make the difference between your ruling one way or another in a case, and every litigant probably feels that their case is a little bit unique. Judges need to think about that and certainly need to be willing to consider that this person’s case might be unique, and therefore, it has to be looked at in a different way than a similar but perhaps not identical case.
Judge ROBERTS. And of course, that’s a lot of how the law develops, and as lawyers arguing in court, a lot of what I used to spend my time doing was saying, ‘‘This precedent doesn’t apply,’’ and the reason it doesn’t apply is because these facts are different, and so you should reach a different result, or arguing that this precedent does apply even though these facts are different. The reasoning still covers that situation, and then that leads to the next case and so on, and it’s that sort of gradual development of the law that helps shape the rule of law.
Senator KYL. Now, you have seen that each one of us have a couple of soap boxes that we like to mount, and after about 5 minutes of our opinion, then we ask you a question. I have one of those for you, something that has been bugging me.
There has been a lot of discussion about the Supreme Court’s reliance, or even reference to foreign law to determine the meaning of the United States Constitution. I just wanted to note a couple of the cases in which this was done recently.
A case this year, Roper v. Simmons, in which the Supreme Court reversed a prior precedent and decided that it would be unconstitutional to execute a man who was 17 at the time that he brutally murdered a woman by throwing her off a bridge. In deciding the
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00211 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

200
case, the Supreme Court not only, in my view, engaged in a questionable analysis of American law, it spent perhaps 20 percent of its legal analysis discussing the laws of Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran, Pakistan, Nigeria and China. The Court claimed that we ought not ‘‘stand alone’’ on this issue, and that we should pay attention to what other nations do when we interpret our Constitution.
In 1999, Justice Breyer argued that the Court should consider whether a long delay in executing a convicted murderer, a delay, by the way, caused by his repeated and arguably frivolous appeals, should be deemed cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment. And he relied on the legal opinions of courts in Zimbabwe, India, Jamaica and Canada.
The trend, if it is to become one, is greatly troubling to me and to many of my colleagues. Our Constitution was drafted by the Nation’s Founders, ratified by the States, and amended repeatedly through our constitutional processes that involve both Federal and State legislators. It is an America Constitution, not a European or an African or an Asian one, and its meaning, it seems to me, by definition, cannot be determined by reference to foreign law.
I also think it would put us on a dangerous path by trying to pick and choose among those foreign laws that we liked or didn’t like. For example, many nations have a weak protection for freedom to participate in or practice one’s religion. Iran and some other Middle Eastern nations come immediately to mind, but even a modern western nation like France has placed restrictions on religious symbols in the public square. That would be highly unlikely to pass muster in U.S. Courts. Should we look to France to tell us what the Free Exercise Clause means, for example?
Even nations that share our common law tradition, such as Great Britain, offer fewer civil liberty guarantees than we do, and the press has far less freedom. Nations such as Canada have allowed their judges to craft a constitutional right to homosexual marriage.
There is a lot more to say on this subject, but I wanted to hear from you, so my question is this: what, if anything, is the proper role of foreign law in U.S. Supreme Court decisions? Of course we are not talking about interpreting treaties or foreign contracts, but cases such as those that would involve interpretations of the U.S. Constitution?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t want to comment on any particular case, but I think I can speak more generally about the approach. I know Justices Scalia and Breyer had a little debate about it themselves here in town, and it was very illuminating to get both of their views. And I would say as a general matter that a couple of things that cause concern on my part about the use of foreign law as precedent—as you say, this isn’t about interpreting treaties or foreign contracts, but as precedent on the meaning of American law.
The first has to do with democratic theory. Judicial decisions in this country—judges of course are not accountable to the people, but we are appointed through a process that allows for participation of the electorate, the President who nominates judges is obviously accountable to the people. The Senators who confirm judges
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00212 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

201
are accountable to the people. In that way the role of the judge is consistent with the democratic theory. If we’re relying on a decision from a German judge about what our Constitution means, no President accountable to the people appointed that judge, and no Senate accountable to the people confirmed that judge, and yet he’s playing a role in shaping a law that binds the people in this country. I think that’s a concern that has to be addressed.
The other part of it that would concern me is that relying on foreign precedent doesn’t confine judges. It doesn’t limit their discretion the way relying on domestic precedent does. Domestic precedent can confine and shape the discretion of the judges.
In foreign law you can find anything you want. If you don’t find it in the decisions of France or Italy, it’s in the decisions of Somalia or Japan or Indonesia or wherever. As somebody said in another context, looking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends. You can find them, they’re there. And that actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows the judge to incorporate his or her own personal preferences, cloak them with the authority of precedent because they’re finding precedent in foreign law, and use that to determine the meaning of the Constitution. I think that’s a misuse of precedent, not a correct use of precedent.
Senator KYL. I appreciate that. We have precious little time to discuss you personal career and views and I want to take just a couple of minutes to give you an opportunity to talk to us about a couple of things.
I see by the record that you have represented at least one death row inmate on a pro bono basis, and I would love to hear about how you took that case and how you dealt with that case.
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t want to overly expand my role. It was consistent with what I’ve done in other cases. There was a particular appellate issue that arose. The firm had been representing the inmate for some time. One of the senior leading partners at the firm, Barrett Prettyman, had been heavily involved in his case for many years. A particular appellate issue came up and I was asked to get involved, and I was happy to do that, and assist in that way. Again, it was kind of consistent with the general approach. It was in an area in which I was—had some experience and was happy to pitch in and help in that area.
Senator KYL. There is a story. It may be apocryphal, and if so, you can disabuse us of it now, but is it really true that you were required to argue a case before the Supreme Court on 2 days notice, and on that same day argued a case in the District of Columbia Circuit Court, or is that not a correct story?
Judge ROBERTS. No. That’s the way it happened. I was scheduled to argue in the D.C. Circuit, and what happened is the Friday before the Monday argument, the clerk of the court called. We had a new lawyer who was not yet a member of the Supreme Court bar in the office, and I think we considered it kind of a pro forma matter, we were moving his admission pro hac vice so he could argue that day. And I think this was the Supreme Court’s way of telling us that they didn’t consider it a pro forma matter. So we got notified the Friday night before the Monday argument that they were not going to grant the pro hac motion, which is of course to let him

202
argue the case even though he wasn’t a member of the bar, and it fell to me to pick up that case to be prepared to argue it Monday morning. Then in the afternoon I went and did the argument in the D.C. Circuit, which had been previously scheduled.
Senator KYL. How did you do in the two cases? Judge ROBERTS. Well, the Court got it right in each case. [Laughter.] Senator KYL. Enough said. You know, another thing that fascinated me, in clerking for two of the most incredible jurists in United States history, Judge Friendly and Justice Rehnquist—I was going to ask you privately but I just have to ask you, and perhaps it would be illuminating for folks, particularly law students. What did you learn from those two very erudite men? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think different things, you pick up different things. With Judge Friendly, it was he had such a total commitment to excellence in his craft at every stage of the process, just a total devotion to the rule of law and the confidence that if you just worked hard enough at it, you’d come up with the right answers. And it was his devotion to the rule of law that he took the most pleasure in. He liked the fact that the editorialists of the day couldn’t decide whether he was a liberal or a conservative, and he would be chastised for the same opinion, depending on which paper had read it, as either that conservative judge or that liberal judge, and because he wasn’t adhering to a political ideology, he was adhering to the rule of law. And his devotion to it went to the extent—and I know other of his clerks had the same experience. I do remember one time where he was assigned the opinion, and he kept writing it and writing it, and he finally decided it was not right. And so he wrote a dissent. And he circulated the best majority he could come up with and said, ‘‘I don’t agree with it, here’s my dissent.’’ And of course, as you might imagine, the other two judges were persuaded by his dissent, and it came out that way, a sort of open-mindedness at every stage, the appreciation that it may not be the argument, it may not be the briefs, it may be down to the actual writing that reveals what he thinks the right answer is. And also he did have an essential humility about him. He was an absolute genius. I mean there’s no doubt about it, and certainly whatever he was reviewing, the decision of an agency, the decision of its legislature, the notion of saying, you know, we defer to them because it’s their responsibility, I think everybody would have agreed we would have a better result if we just let him make the decision, regardless of what it was. But he had the essential humility to appreciate that he was a judge, and that this decision should be made by this agency or this decision by that legislature. And when you read his opinions, he doesn’t just sort of, you know, knock the pieces off the board. He marches through in a very careful way to let you know exactly how he reached the decision, why he went this way if there was a difference among the precedents, why he chose that one if there was a question of who has the responsibility, why he went that way, and lays it all out in such a way that you can understand the result.

203
To this day, lawyers will say, when they get into an area of the law and they pick up one of his opinions, that you can look at it and it’s like having a guide to the whole area of the law.
With the then-Justice Rehnquist, who I clerked for the next year, I do remember doing a draft for him once, and coming in and he had thought that it was sort of the first topic sentence of each paragraph was good, and the rest of it could be junked. You know, I pushed back a little bit as I hoped was appropriate, and he said at that point, he said, ‘‘Well, I’ll tell you what. Why don’t we put all this other stuff down in footnotes? We’ll just keep sort of the first sentence of each paragraph, put the rest down in footnotes.’’ And I figured, well, that was a fair compromise.
So I would go back and rework it, and hand it to him with some pride, and he looks at it and he says, ‘‘Well, all right. Now take out the footnotes.’’
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. So one thing I learned from him was, I hope, to try to write crisply and efficiently, that a lot of extra stuff could be dispensed with, and just—so many people mentioned it during his eulogies and at the sort of gathering of the clerks, his general approach to the balance between work and family life. I think that was a very important lesson to learn at an early age. Senator KYL. Judge, thank you. I think that tells us not only something about you as a person, about your style of judging, but probably some good lessons for all of us. So thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kyl. Senator Kohl? Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, yesterday you described your role as a judge as just an umpire, as you called it, calling balls and strikes. That is an interesting analogy for me as I have more than most some personal experience with umpires and referees. But as all of us with any involvement in sports know, no two umpires or no two referees have the same strike zone or call the same kind of a basketball game, and ballplayers and basketball players understand that, depending upon who the umpire is and who the referee is, the game can be called entirely differently. When we look at real legal cases, I wonder whether or not your analogy works. For example, in our private conversation, I asked you whether the words of the Constitution must always be interpreted in the same way as the authors originally intended. For example, the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the laws to all citizens, was written at a time when schools were, in fact, segregated based on race. And yet in Brown v. Board of Education, the Equal Protection Clause was interpreted to find segregation schools unconstitutional, and you, of course, have endorsed that decision. No one disagrees with that conclusion today, but would a neutral umpire, as you described yourself yesterday, have decided back in 1954 to expand the words of the Constitution outside of the strike zone? Would a neutral umpire have overturned a 58-year-old Supreme Court precedent and gone against the understanding of the authors of the 14th Amendment and also the views of almost half

204
of the State legislatures at that time in making the decision that they made?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I think the answer to your question is yes. The research into the original understanding of the drafters of the 14th Amendment has expanded and changed quite a bit, and I think a very good case can be made about their views. But, more importantly, the issue was the institution of public education wasn’t as established at the time as it was in 1954, the time of the crafting of the amendment. And, you know, the Framers spoke in broad language, and whether they specifically addressed the question of public education or not isn’t the limitation. Their intent was not limited to the particular problem. They chose broad language, and they should be held to their word. And I think it is perfectly consistent with an original understanding to argue and to conclude that their original understanding meant that segregated schools were unconstitutional, not just in 1954 but at the time they enacted the amendment. I think a strong case can be made there.
And what was interesting about the Brown case—maybe it’s my own perspective, but if you look at the arguments in that case, yes, John W. Davis arguing for the Board was arguing on the basis of precedent in Plessy v. Ferguson, saying this is the established law. But so was Thurgood Marshall. He went in and he was arguing on the basis of more recent precedent, Sweatt v. Painter, a more recent decision of the Court about law school separate but equal. And he was saying you need to build on that more recent precedent in addressing this case.
So the Court was not changing the strike zone. That wasn’t the way Marshall presented his argument. And it wasn’t necessary for them to say we’re changing the rules of the game. What was necessary for them to do and what Marshall was urging them to do was to get it right when they had gotten it wrong in Plessy.
Senator KOHL. Judge, back in 1954, clearly the Supreme Court Justices were willing to step outside the box, to break new ground, to do something that no one, no Court, no legislature, no President had done before, and strike out in an entirely new and positive direction for this country. They were not umpires simply calling balls and strikes. They were breaking new ground, and they did so in the best interest of our country, didn’t they?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, of course, it was a dramatic shift, and the overruling of Plessy v. Ferguson was exactly that. My point is simply that if you look at the Brown decision, it is more consistent with the 14th Amendment and the original understanding of the 14th Amendment than Plessy v. Ferguson, and it’s based on the conclusion that the separation of the races in the schools was itself a violation of equal protection. In other words, it’s not a departure from the 14th Amendment. It was a departure from the—
Senator KOHL. But it was ground-breaking. Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator KOHL. One more observation, Judge, about your analogy of the judge as an umpire, neutral umpire. You are 50 years old. You bring great life experience to the bench, Judge, and don’t you and all judges bring their own life experiences, their philosophies to the bench in deciding cases? Or would you have us believe—and

205
if not, you can correct that—that judges merely operate as automatons?
Judge ROBERTS. Not automatons, no, Senator. I appreciate that, that judges don’t. And, of course, we all bring our life experiences to the bench. But I will say this: that the ideal in the American justice system is epitomized by the fact that judges, Justices, do wear the black robes, and that is meant to symbolize the fact that they’re not individuals promoting their own particular views, but they are supposed to be doing their best to interpret the law, to interpret the Constitution, according to the rule of law, not their own preferences, not their own personal beliefs. That’s the ideal.
Senator KOHL. And isn’t it also true that, to a large extent, the greatest men in our history, judicial, executive, legislative, have been men and women with both great minds and great hearts?
Judge ROBERTS. Absolutely. Senator KOHL. Judge, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we all saw that those who suffered the most were those who have not been able to take advantage of the great opportunities that our great country has to offer. As we found out, those without employment opportunities and educational opportunities simply did not have the means to escape the storm and the flooding. As you seek to become the head of the judicial branch, as you seek the position of Chief Justice of the United States of America, what role would you play in making right the wrongs revealed by Katrina? And what role do you and the judicial branch play in making sure that we as a Nation keep on moving forward towards providing equal opportunity to all Americans? Judge ROBERTS. The last part of your question, Senator, is, of course, really what’s carved on the entrance to the Supreme Court: ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ That is the commitment physically embodied in the Supreme Court, and it’s the commitment in the Constitution. And I think the most important thing the Supreme Court can do and the judicial branch can do is to uphold the rule of law. That is the—I tried to point this out in my statement yesterday. That is the key to making all the rights that are in the Constitution, all the rights that legislators may confer on citizens, that’s the key to making them meaningful. The difference between our system and our Constitution and the Soviet constitution that President Reagan used to talk about—it has wonderful rights in it, too. It didn’t mean a thing because there was not an independent Supreme Court, an independent judiciary to enforce those rights. We do have that, and that’s the reason that we have been able to make progress in the area of rights and not had just empty paper promises. So to the extent you’re talking about the injustices in society and the discrimination in society, the best thing the courts can do is enforce the rule of law and provide a level playing field for people to come in and vindicate their rights and enforce the rule of law. Senator KOHL. But in spite of all of our laws and all of our rules, we still saw what happened down in New Orleans, and the people who were left behind were people who had not had educational or employment opportunities. And the question I asked was whether you as a person who aspires to become the Chief Justice of the United States see a particular role other than continuing the role

that you observe we are following now, a particular role for improving our ability to respond to the needs of those people who live under those circumstances.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the courts are, of course, passive institutions. We hear cases that are brought before us. We don’t go out and bring cases. We don’t have the constitutional authority to execute the law. We don’t have the constitutional authority to make the law. Our obligation is decide the cases that are presented.
Now, I’m confident, just in the nature of things, that there will be cases presented arising out of that horrible disaster of all sorts, and many of those will be Federal cases, I’m sure. Others will be in the State courts, and, again, the obligation of the Federal judiciary and the State judiciary is to make sure they provide a place where people can have their claims, their litigation decided fairly and efficiently according to the rule of law. That’s the appropriate role for the judicial branch.
Senator KOHL. All right. Judge, do you believe that reasonable people can disagree on Roe v. Wade? Regardless of what you think of the decision, do you believe that there is an intellectually honest approach on the other side that is worth respecting?
Judge ROBERTS. I certainly agree that reasonable people can disagree about that decision, yes.
Senator KOHL. And you do, obviously, respect people on the other side of the issue?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator KOHL. In Rust v. Sullivan, as Deputy Solicitor General, you signed a brief in which you wrote, and I quote, ‘‘The Court’s conclusions in Roe that there is a fundamental right to an abortion and that Government has no compelling interest in protecting prenatal human life throughout pregnancy find no support in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution.’’ So does this quote jibe with your statement that you understand that reasonable people can disagree? Judge ROBERTS. I think so, Senator. The position that you’re reading from there was the position of the administration. I was one of nine lawyers on the brief in that case. It was reflecting the position that had been advanced in four prior cases up to that point by the administration, and we were reiterating that position. This was before the Supreme Court issued its decision in Casey. That was the view of the administration and the conclusion. I don’t think there’s anything in there that suggests we think or thought that anybody at that time who disagreed was unreasonable. That was our legal position. The other side was obviously presented in those cases. Senator KOHL. But you are saying here that there is no support in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution for that position. That is pretty flat-out, pretty straight, pretty black and white. Judge ROBERTS. And in those cases, the other side argued that there was. And I don’t think there’s anything in either of those views that suggests you don’t think that reasonable people can take different positions on those questions. Senator KOHL. You have today suggested on numerous occasions that the things that you represented in writing or in opinion back in the 1980s and into the 1990s, working for the Reagan adminis-

tration and working for the Attorney General and then finally working as Deputy Solicitor General, were in many cases the opinions of people for whom you worked, not necessarily your own. I assume, therefore, there are those opinions that you are prepared to disavow.
Judge ROBERTS. My view in preparing all the memoranda that people have been talking about was as a staff lawyer. I was promoting the views of the people for whom I worked. In some instances, those were consistent with personal views; in other instances, they may not be. In most instances, no one cared terribly much what my personal views were. They were to advance the views of the administration for which I worked.
Senator KOHL. Well, I appreciate that, and not that we are talking about you in an entirely different situation, of course, our curiosity is which of those positions were you supportive of or are you still supportive of and which would you disavow?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, at this point, of course, we are now 23, 24 years later. I would not—I would have to address each of those positions anew. I wouldn’t try to transport myself back 24 years and say, What did you think 24 years ago? And that would require me to look at and examine all those things. And, of course, it’s not how I would look at the issue if I were a judge. If I were a staff lawyer advancing a particular view, it’s one thing. As a judge, I would want to confront the issue with an open mind, to fully and fairly consider the briefs and arguments of all parties, to consider the record—we’ve talked today about how important a record is in a particular case—consider the law and the precedents. And, of course, the law and the precedents have changed in many of these areas dramatically over the past 24 years.
I’d have to consider all those before reaching a conclusion in any of those particular areas.
Senator KOHL. Sure. It would be helpful to many of us to know which of those positions you took then no longer represent the position that you would take today. I think that would show a change as we grow and develop and experience life. That would be illuminating and enlightening to many of us to hear what some of those positions you took then no longer are represented in your thought process today.
Judge, as we all know, the Griswold v. Connecticut case guarantees that there is a fundamental right to privacy in the Constitution as it applies to contraception. Do you agree with that decision and that there is a fundamental right to privacy as it relates to contraception? In your opinion, is that settled law?
Judge ROBERTS. I agree with the Griswold Court’s conclusion that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that. The Court since Griswold has grounded the privacy right discussed in that case in the liberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause—that’s the approach that the Court has taken in subsequent cases—rather than in the penumbras and emanations that were discussed in Justice Douglas’ opinion. And that view of the result is, I think, consistent with the subsequent development of the law, which is focused on the Due Process Clause and liberty rather than Justice Douglas’ approach.

208
Senator KOHL. Well, I am delighted to hear you say that because, as you know, many, many constitutional scholars believe that once you accept the reasoning of Griswold and find that the Constitution does contain a right to privacy and a right to contraception, you have essentially accepted—scholars have said this, essentially accepted the basis for the Court’s reasoning and decision on Roe, that a woman has a constitutionally protected right to choose. These scholars reason that it follows logically that if a woman’s right to privacy and her control over her body includes the right to contraception, it also includes a woman’s right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. I am not sure whether you wish to comment on that. I just wanted to point out to you something that I am sure you are familiar with, that there is in constitutional thought a logic connected from Griswold to Roe.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I feel comfortable commenting on Griswold and the result in Griswold because that does not appear to me to be an area that is going to come before the Court again. It was surprising when it came before the Court in 1965, I think, to many people. The other area is an area that is, to quote Justice Ginsburg from her hearings, ‘‘live with business.’’ There are cases that arise there, and so that’s an area that I do not feel it appropriate for me to comment on.
Senator KOHL. I appreciate that. Judge, as we all know, you were originally nominated to replace the first woman ever to sit on the Supreme Court, Sandra Day O’Connor. There was a lot of speculation when she announced her retirement that the President might choose a woman to replace her, and she even suggested a little disappointment, not with you but with the fact that a woman was not chosen. Had the President told you that the selection was down to you and an equally qualified woman for the post but that he thought a woman was needed, would you have seen that as a reasonable conclusion on his part? Judge ROBERTS. I certainly think Presidents have and will consider a broad range of issues and characteristics and qualifications in selecting their nominees, and that’s certainly one for a President to consider. Senator KOHL. All things being equal in terms of qualifications, would you be pleased if the President chose a woman to replace Sandra Day O’Connor? Judge ROBERTS. For the upcoming vacancy? Senator KOHL. Yes. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I just wanted to make clear we weren’t talking about this one. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to comment in any way about the President’s future selections, other than to say that I’m happy with his past ones. [Laughter.] Senator KOHL. You are not an automaton. Judge Roberts, in an October 3, 1983, memo, you wrote that while you served as Associate White House Counsel for the Reagan administration, you expressed support for judicial term limits. You did specifically support the idea of limiting judicial terms to 15

209
years, and you said, I quote, ‘‘to ensure that Federal judges would not lose all touch with reality through decades of ivory tower existence.’’ And do you still support in theory the idea of judicial term limits?
Judge ROBERTS. You know, that would be one of those memos that I no longer agree with, Senator.
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I didn’t fully appreciate what was involved in the confirmation process when I wrote that. You know, the sentiments that were expressed there I think are certainly something that’s worth discussing, perhaps. My basic point was when the Framers establish a system of life tenure, people didn’t live as long as they do now. You know, I do think there are concerns, though, that I may be a little more, a bit more sensitive to now than I was then, and they have to do with sort of a definite cut-off point. I’m not sure that’s healthy for the institution of the judiciary, for people to know, for example, well, it’s sort of like—as you say, term limits—that if we wait another year, this judge will be gone or that Justice will be gone. I’m not sure today from where I sit that that is a good or healthy thing for the judiciary. Senator KOHL. So you do not support term limits anymore? Judge ROBERTS. I have to say I do not because I do think that that restriction at the end, so litigants could look and shape their litigation in light of who they think the judges or Justices might be, I think that’s not a healthy development. I would note that, if I’m remembering the memo correctly, I think it was a proposed constitutional amendment, which I am not sure, but I think that obviously is a policy choice that the Constitution allows to be pursued through that process. Senator KOHL. All right. Judge, as you know, confronted with a legal problem, most American families, unlike wealthy families and very large businesses, lack the resources to hire the largest and most preeminent law firms to do their bidding. Do you agree that for our Nation’s working people securing civil justice is often rendered substantially much more difficult because it simply does cost too much? Do you have suggestions for addressing this issue? Do you worry that captivating national events, such as the O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson trials, reinforce the view that in this country justice can be for sale and available to those who can afford it? Judge ROBERTS. You know, I do think that the availability of legal services is not as broad and widespread as it should be. There are so many things and areas where I think lawyers could make a valuable contribution, but it’s too expensive. And there are a number of responses that I think the bar should be taking. Obviously, for those at the lowest end of the income scale, I think there’s an obligation to provide pro bono legal services. I think the big firms, little firms, medium firms—everybody needs to get involved in that. There’s not enough appreciation about how you can do that. For example, everybody thinks in terms of bringing a big case, litigation. You know, lawyers who do estate work can provide extremely valuable pro bono services. Lawyers who do tax work can

210
provide extremely valuable pro bono services, the whole range of services, corporate work. I know lawyers in my old firm would do a lot of pro bono services helping set up nonprofit organizations, ensuring that they’re complying with the law. People need to be a little more creative in the ways in which they can help.
I regard that as an obligation of the bar and I do think—in fact, in many cases, the situation you get is the people at the lowest end have access to pro bono services. People at the highest end can pay. It’s the people in the middle who are left without legal services that could be extremely valuable, and I do think the bar needs to do more. I think firms need to do more. Individual lawyers need to do more.
Senator KOHL. Judge Roberts, as you know, over the last two decades or so, there have been several bills introduced in Congress to strip the Supreme Court and all other Federal courts of their jurisdiction over many issues. These bills are generally sponsored by people who are unhappy with various court decisions, including decisions on things like school prayer, remedies for school desegregation, and even a woman’s right to choose.
While you served in the Justice Department and in the White House Counsel’s Office in the Reagan administration in the 1980s, you did state that you believed that bills stripping the Court’s jurisdiction were constitutionally permissible. Do you still hold this view? Do you think it is the right way for us to go, to allow legislatures to strip your authority to review cases?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I know the memos to which you’re referring make the point, answer your second question. I said that they were a bad idea. They were bad policy.
I’d been asked earlier when I was—back in 1981, I believe, when I was working in the Attorney General’s office, to present to him an affirmative case for the proposition that these proposals were constitutional. He was getting an opinion that they were unconstitutional. He had to make that decision for the Department’s position. He wanted me to argue the other side and I did. I prepared a memorandum presenting the best argument I could that these proposals were constitutional.
The two memos to which you refer in the White House where I suggested I thought they were suggest that my memo persuaded me, if nobody else. The Attorney General adopted instead the contrary position. And I think my views may have had something to do with the proximity to my own advocacy at the time.
As I say, I did say they were a bad policy. The reason I thought they were a bad policy is because they lead to a situation where there’s arguable inconsistency and disuniformity in Federal law. If you don’t have the Supreme Court with jurisdiction to address that, then you get different decisions, and that’s bad policy.
If I were to look at the question today, to be honest with you, I don’t know where I would come out. I think one of the questions I would have is whether these concerns I had that I labeled as policy concerns might more appropriately be considered legal arguments, in other words, not a policy dispute but a legal argument.
That’s the way the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that the Attorney General agreed with viewed it. They said these—the fact of disuniformity and inconsistency is a legal argument against the

211
constitutionality. It’s not simply a bad policy decision. I’m not sure where I would regard that determination today.
Senator KOHL. Really? Are you saying that you’re not sure where you would come out if you were faced with the decision to go along with or to fight legislative attempts to take away the Court’s authority?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t think—on the question of legislative attempts, I think my view is the same now as it was 24 years ago, which is that these are—it’s a bad idea. It’s bad policy.
I was talking about the other question about whether it’s constitutional or not, and on that, of course, I don’t think I should express a determinative view because, as you know, these proposals do come up and one may be enacted, and if that is the case, then I’d have to address that question on the court. It could be on the court I’m on now or another court.
Senator KOHL. Well, in that case, or in this case, your heart might tell you that it’s a bad idea. Your mind might tell you it is constitutional.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t know what my mind would tell me—
Senator KOHL. I mean, theoretically. It is possible. Judge ROBERTS. Yes, but I feel comfortable with the conclusion, as I was 24 years ago, that it’s a bad idea. They’re bad policy. Senator KOHL. All right. Judge, since your nomination, literally, as you know, tens of thousands of pages of your writings as a young White House aide have been released and looked at very carefully. In some of these writings, you took very pointed positions, as we discussed, some political, some constitutional, and some that have raised eyebrows. I also think about myself when I was in my 20s and then when I was at the age which you are now and who I have become today and how I have changed, matured, and hopefully grown as I have gotten older. I am sure when you have had a chance to review some of your old work as part of this process that there are things that you wrote back then that make you cringe, perhaps, today. Are there positions you took back then as a 20-something lawyer that you would not take today? Can you give us a couple of examples of positions that you took then that, as you have grown and developed, and as you are now sitting before us to be the Chief Justice of the United States of America, that you are today not the person that you were back when you were 20-something? Judge ROBERTS. Well, we’ve talked about the term limits for judges. More generally, as I look at all of these documents, and the numbers, somebody said 80,000 pages. It’s a little daunting. I don’t know that there are particular issues. I mean, you have to remember, this is 23, 22, 24 years ago. In many of these cases, not only have I changed, the law has changed dramatically in more than two decades. You know, I’m sure—and again, of the many that have been released, I will say that it’s really only a handful that have attracted attention for one reason or another, and I do think if you look at the whole body of work, that I would hope people would leave that with a favorable impression.

Certainly, there are many areas where it appears that I knew a lot more when I was 25 than I think I know now when I’m 50. I had a lot of different experiences in the intervening period that give you valuable perspective. In that intervening period, for example, I left the government, went out in the private sector, litigated a lot of cases against the government. You do get a different view of things when you’re on the other side. I think that’s extremely valuable.
I hope, as you suggest, I’ve grown as a person over that period, as well, and that that also gives you some perspective and that type of a perspective might cause somebody to moderate their tone with respect to some issues and in some areas, and I’m sure that’s the case. I certainly wouldn’t write everything today as I wrote it back then, but I don’t think any of us would do things or write things today as we did when we were 25 and had all the answers.
Senator KOHL. I thank you, Judge Roberts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kohl. Senator DeWine? Senator DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, good afternoon. Judge ROBERTS. Good afternoon. Senator DEWINE. Judge, the good news is that I represent the halfway point. [Laughter.] Senator DEWINE. The bad news is, it is the first round. [Laughter.] Senator DEWINE. Judge, I want to ask you about one of your more important, probably least understood, not by you, but least understood by the public, your role if you are confirmed as the Chief Justice, and that is your job to appoint the members of the FISA Court. Judge, as you know, in 1978, Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law, of course, set up the FISA Court. As you well know, this is the court that our intelligence agents go to when they want to obtain wiretaps or search warrants against terrorists and foreign spies, a very important court, a court that meets in secret, a court that deals with the most important national security matters that we have really in our country, but also a court that deals with our precious civil liberties. And Judge, because it is a court that meets in secret, it doesn’t have the public scrutiny, doesn’t have the glare of publicity, and quite candidly, does not have much oversight. So I would like to know, besides what is in the statute, the statute sets out your job to select the 11 judges who sit on the FISA court and three judges who sit on the FISA Court of Review. There are certain guidelines in the statute. But besides that, I wonder if you could tell us what your criteria will be when you select these men, these women who will serve on the court, and I wonder if you could give me your personal assurance that this will be something that will be very important to you, that you will take a hands-on approach, and that you will be very personally involved in, because really, it is a question of the utmost national security. These are

213
people who are going to make sometimes life and death decisions for our country.
Judge ROBERTS. I appreciate that, Senator. If I am confirmed, that is something that I will address and take very seriously. I think, as in many areas, my first priority is going to be to listen, to learn a little bit more about what’s involved.
I’ll be very candid. When I first learned about the FISA Court, I was surprised. It’s not what we usually think of when we think of a court. We think of a place where we can go, we can watch the lawyers argue and it’s subject to the glare of publicity and the judges explain their decision to the public and they can examine them. That’s what we think of as a court.
This is a very different and unusual institution. That was my first reaction. I appreciate the reasons that it operates the way it does, but it does seem to me that the departures from the normal judicial model that are involved there put a premium on the individuals involved.
I think the people who are selected for that tribunal have to be above reproach. There can’t be any question that these are among the best judges that our system has, the fairest judges, the ones who are most sensitive to the different issues involved because they don’t have the oversight of the public being able to see what’s going on.
Again, to be perfectly honest, it is a very unusual situation and I do think it places a great premium on making sure that the bestqualified people for that position are selected.
Senator DEWINE. I appreciate your personal attention to that. I know how important you know it is, Judge, and I would just add one more comment, that that court, as all courts do, but even more so, not only makes decisions, not only decides whether to issue the warrant or not, but it is the feedback that the Justice Department gets and that law enforcement agencies get that tells them what they can do and can’t do, and that feedback is unbelievably important and it affects the intelligence operations in this country and is just vitally, vitally important.
Let me move, if I could, to something that is very important to me and to all of us and that is the First Amendment. Certainly, Judge, there is no right in our Constitution that is any more important than the freedom of speech. In a sense, it is the foundation of our democracy. It is the right upon which other rights are built. It is the right that guards our liberty and preserves our freedom.
At the heart of the First Amendment is the idea that people have a right not only to speak their mind, but also to be heard. I would like to talk to you a little bit about that and ask you a question.
The case I think that most eloquently talks about the public square where we engage in speech is Hague v. CIO, a 1939 case which you are well familiar with, and I want to quote it very briefly.
‘‘Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and time out of mind have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has from ancient times

214
been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens,’’ end of quote.
Judge, I want to be honest with you and say that as of late, I feel that we are seeing a disturbing trend when it comes to speech in the public arena. I want to give you some examples.
In a recent case, a Wisconsin woman was kicked off a city bus, and this is what she was kicked off a city bus for doing. She was trying to distribute a book containing Bible stories to individuals sitting next to her.
Another case that is repeated time and time again across this country and has been for many years in towns and cities and villages across the country, individuals are prohibited from placing political signs, and it could be not just for candidates, it could be for a school levy, against a school levy, on their own property—on their own property—except during specified times and in specified ways. The government tells them, so many days before the election. You can’t put that up there until so many days before the election, not just for candidates, but for bond issues, whatever the issue that they want to talk about, do their own political speech, on their own property.
Another example, in many public—people who wish to exercise free speech in many public places, these individuals are forced into so-called ‘‘free speech zones,’’ which many times are far away from the event that they wish to protest about, so far away that they can’t ever been seen or ever be heard, out of sight. Again, we go back to the issue of you have to be heard.
In one recent case, the New York City Housing Authority refused to let a woman conduct Bible studies in the community center of a housing project, even though the community center was used for a host of activities, even weddings. I must say, in that case, she actually won the case.
So I am concerned when I see these restrictions. I think at the core of the First Amendment is the idea that individuals should be able to speak and be heard in public places.
Now, Judge, I know you can’t tell us how you will decide any particular case. I am not asking you to do that. But it is important to me that you talk to us a little bit about how you will evaluate these cases involving the right to speak in public places, public places such as buses, metro stations, city sidewalks, public parks, and tell us, if you could, Judge, what factors will you consider when deciding restrictions on speech in the public square as we traditionally know it and what is proper under the First Amendment and which ones are not. What tools will you use to decide that?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, of course, without commenting on any of the particular hypotheticals or actual cases—
Senator DEWINE. That is right. I am not asking—and they are all real cases, but I don’t want you to talk about that.
Judge ROBERTS. I do think, though, first as a general matter and then to get into the law, that it is important that people keep a basic principle in mind when they’re addressing these types of concerns. It’s not a provision in the Constitution, it’s not a provision in the law, but it’s a basic American approach that I think is important, and that’s captured in the expression, you know, it’s a free

215
country. And when you’re talking about what people can say, what people can—signs they can put up, what they can do, I think people, as a general matter, need to appreciate that it’s a free country and it’s a wonderful thing that people can say things in the public that you may not agree with because you, of course, have the same right.
Now, the particular mode of analysis that the Supreme Court uses in addressing these types of public speech issues is to some extent unsettled. The public forum doctrine, as it’s called, for many years you’ve tried to characterize an issue. Is this a public forum? Is it a quasi-public forum? Is it a private forum? And the different definition sort of carried with it the conclusion about what could be allowed, and many of the Justices thought that the reasoning was awfully circular.
I remember years ago I argued one of the cases in the Supreme Court about post office and what could be done in a post office area and whether the restriction of that area to postal business meant they could exclude people who wanted to engage in political speech. I remember thinking at the time that the precedents were very unsettled and I’m not sure that the Court has made much progress since then.
But you do try to focus a little bit on whether you’re dealing with a public forum, one that has traditionally been open to expression, and if it has, then any restrictions on expression are going to be subject to a very exacting standard before they’ll be upheld. If it’s a more limited public forum, it’s only been open for certain types of speech or the nature of the forum requires there to be a restriction—that was the government’s argument in the post office case I litigated—then it’s a less-demanding standard in those situations.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, let me just follow up with that with a short question, if you would give me just a reaction to this, if I could. Do you think the First Amendment is flexible enough in the year 2005 to account for what I believe, at least, is the shrinking public square? I know we have the Internet, we have TV, we have radio, a lot of things that we didn’t have when our Founders wrote the Constitution. But I think there is a shrinking public square.
What do I mean by this? Someone who wants to run for school board today, someone who wants to support a school levy, oppose a school levy, when you and I were growing you—you are younger than I am, but when we were growing up in the Midwest, you could go downtown. If you supported a school levy, let us say, you could go downtown and pass out literature in front of the hardware store or the grocery store and that was a public place because there was a sidewalk and you knew everybody in town was probably going to go by there. And if you lived in a city, there were communities in the city where you could do the same thing.
Today, most people—we just don’t live that way. Most people don’t. Some do, but most don’t. Today, people get in their car and if they go to the grocery store, they go to a strip mall and they go to a grocery store that is surrounded all by private property, and the people who own that strip mall say you can’t come—usually say you can’t come on and distribute any literature of any kind on this facility, and basically they are upheld in that right because it is private property. Or they go buy their clothes or everything else or

their hardware, they go in a big mall and that mall clearly—there is a Supreme Court case right on point that says that they can be excluded.
So the traditional public forum as we know it has really shrunk. Does the Court take that into consideration when they look at the precedents, they look at all the decisions that have been made? How does that—without citing any case or talking about any specifics—
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I do know— Senator DEWINE. It is a different world we live in today. Judge ROBERTS. I appreciate the point, and I do know that even the analysis in this particular area, one of the factors that the Court considers is the availability of alternative avenues for expression, and a concern, if they are cutting off a particular mode of expression, a particular avenue, are there alternatives available? And I think that’s a very important consideration. I think you’re quite right that this is one of those areas in which technology is going to figure in a very prominent way, and the question of whether this type of analysis that grew up when you’re talking about a public square or a town hall type thing, applies in the Internet situation, and whether there’s changes that do need to be made in the analysis. Senator DEWINE. Since you talked about the Internet, let me turn to a disturbing trend in regard to the Internet, and that has, quite frankly, to do with pornography. We have passed several bills in Congress, the Communications Decency Act to protect our children. The Supreme Court struck it down. I am not going to ask you to comment about that. A few years later we passed the Child Online Protection Act, again, with the intent to protect our children. Again the Court struck it down. Unlike the traditional public square, the Internet has really become a place for the distribution of some, I find, very troubling materials, and that is pornography. I guess what bothers me about these cases is they fail to account for something that to me at least is very relatively simple, and that is that at the core of the First Amendment is, to me at least, the protection of political speech, speech on matters of public concern, I have talked about before. But it seems to me that pornography is different, particularly pornography that children can easily access. It seems to me that that should be treated differently than political speech. Famous case, Young v. American Mini Theaters. In that case the Court upheld zoning regulations on adult theaters. Justice Stevens, hardly a right-winger, had this to say, and I quote: ‘‘Even though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society’s interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different and lesser magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate.’’ Few of us would march our sons and daughters off to war to preserve the citizen’s right to see ‘‘specified sexual activities’’ exhibited in the ‘‘theaters of our choice.’’ Judge, in light of that quotation, here are my questions. Are there or should there be different levels of speech under the First Amendment? Should pornography, for instance, be treated with

217
less regard than Mark Twain’s Huck Finn? And how would you, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, decide what protection, if any, certain kinds of expression are entitled to under the First Amendment?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, it’s my understanding under the Supreme Court’s doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not.
That question is sort of antecedent to the question of what the level of protection is. We determine whether it’s entitled to First Amendment protection in the first place. In certain types of speech, like child pornography, the Court has determined are not entitled to protection under the First Amendment. There are different categories, and the Court has struggled over the years in figuring out how to determine those categories and what belongs in what category, and beyond that, I don’t think I can give a more precise answer.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, let me turn to the area of congressional power. It has been talked about before here, but I want to talk about it a little bit more. Really, this has to do with federalism cases. As you know, the Court has handed down a number of cases that have restricted the power of Congress to pass important legislation. The Court has struck down portions of the Violence Against Women Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, just to name a few.
In some of these cases the Court restricted Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. In some it relied on the 11th Amendment, and in some it cited Section 5 of the 14th Amendment. The particular provision is not that important for this discussion. Let me be perfectly frank. I think there are some problems with these decisions. I think it is wrong for judges to take on the role of policymaker. I realize that if a statute is blatantly unconstitutional, a judge has to do their duty. But I think for the reason I am going to discuss in a minute, that was not true in these cases.
I want to cite one example, and that is—because of time I can only go through one—and that is the Garrett case, a 5–4 decision, Board of Trustees v. Garrett. As you know, this case involved a woman who said that she had been discriminated against because she was disabled. She was employed by the State of Alabama. She sued the State under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Supreme Court threw out the suit, holding that there was no evidence that the State discriminated against the disabled in employment decisions. I think the problem with Garrett is that the Court ignored findings by Congress.
There were other cases that have been decided, where we did not have findings, and you are familiar with those. I understand the Court’s decisions. I might like them or not like them, but I understand them.
This case we made findings. While we were considering the Americans with Disabilities Act we held 13 hearings and we set up
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00229 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

218
a task force, a task force that held hearings in every State. It was attended by more than 30,000 individuals. Based on these hearings we found 300 examples of disabled individuals being discriminated against in employment decisions. We found that two-thirds of all disabled Americans between the ages of 16 and 64 were not working at all, even though a large majority of them were capable of doing so. We found that this discrimination flowed from stereotypic assumptions about the disabled, as well as, quote, ‘‘purposeful, unequal treatment,’’ all findings by this elected Congress of the United States.
In Garrett, however, the Court said this was not enough. They rejected our fact findings, holding that we had not pointed to any evidence that the States discriminated in employment decisions against the disabled.
Judge, you have stressed repeatedly in your writings and your opinions—and I have a great deal of respect for you and appreciate these writings and opinions—you stressed the limited role that judges must play in our system of Government. I applaud you for that approach. It is important for me to ensure that you still hold to this belief. In your opinion, what role should a judge play when reviewing congressional fact findings? In your view, how much deference do congressional fact findings deserve? I understand you are not going to talk about this case, or any of the cases I have just cited. I wanted to lay that kind of as a predicate. I wanted to tell you where I am coming from.
But just talk in general about when you see fact findings by Congress, when we have held hearings, when we have established a record, how do you approach? What are the tools that you use, Judge, based on the precedents and based on what you think the role of the judge is?
Judge ROBERTS. Again, and of course, without getting into the particulars, the reason that congressional fact finding and determination is important in these cases is because the courts recognize that they can’t do that. Courts can’t have, as you said, whatever it was, the 13 separate hearings before passing particular legislation. Courts—the Supreme Court can’t sit and hear witness after witness after witness in a particular area and develop that kind of a record. Courts can’t make the policy judgments about what type of legislation is necessary in light of the findings that are made. So the findings play an important role, and I think it is correct to say under the law in this area and others, they’re neither necessary nor necessarily sufficient. But I know as a judge that they’re extremely helpful when there are findings.
And judges know when they look at those, that they’re the result of an exhaustive process of a sort that the Court cannot duplicate. We simply don’t have the institutional expertise or the resources or the authority to engage in that type of a process. So that is sort of the basis for the deference to the fact finding that is made. It’s institutional competence. The courts don’t have it. Congress does. It’s constitutional authority. It’s not our job. It is your job. So the defence to congressional findings in this area has a solid basis.
Now, the particular area you’re talking about under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, the Garrett case, there are of course more recent cases that you know of, Tennessee v. Lane and the Hibbs case
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00230 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

219
in Nevada v. Hibbs, where the Court did defer to the fact finding in those cases, and particularly in the Hibbs case focused on the legislative recognition based on its examination of the factual record developed at hearings about the statute that was at issue there, and the particular approach that they were taking to remedy discrimination under the 14th Amendment, which is the authority that Congress has.
Now, the legal requirement that the Court has articulated there came of course from the City of Boerne case, that the remedial approach has to be congruent and proportional. Justice Scalia signed on to that approach in the City of Boerne case. In the Lane case he said he had changed his mind and he no longer agreed with that. Any area of the law where Justice Scalia is changing his mind, has got to be one that is particularly difficult, and one that I think is appropriately regarded as still evolving and emerging. And so I don’t know if the more recent cases in Lane and Hibbs represent a swinging of the pendulum away from cases like Garrett and Kimmel on the other side, or if it’s simply part of the process of the Court trying to come to rest with an approach in this area.
But it is an area that the Court has found difficult, and just as a general matter, I think when you get to this point of reweighing congressional findings, that starts to look more like a legislative function, and the courts need to be very careful as they get into that area, to make sure that they’re interpreting the law and not making it.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, I appreciate your answer, and I am going to move on. I would just say that one of the more disturbing things to me about Garrett is that the dissent and the majority opinion got into a dispute, a verbal dispute about what the facts were, and a dispute about the facts, it seems to me that is not usually what the Supreme Court gets involved in, and it seems if there is a dispute in the facts, you would normally defer to the fact finder, Congress.
Let me take off on Garrett and maybe talk about another way to get at this. Rather than focus on the problem caused by Garrett, maybe there is another way to solve some of the problems that would be raised by this.
Congress still has the power to protect the disabled under the Spending Clause of the Constitution. We have the power of the purse. In South Dakota v. Dole we wanted to establish a national drinking age of 21. You are well aware of that. It was upheld by the Court. We did it through the power of the purse in the Dole case. I just wonder if Congress might be able to use this approach to require the States to waive their immunity from suit under statutes like the Americans with Disabilities Act. It seems to me that under the Spending Clause, we have at our disposal the power to protect the disabled, to protect other groups, and effectively overturn cases like Garrett and these other cases that limit legislative power.
You seem to take that approach in a case entitled Barber v. Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority. That case concerned a disabled person who was suing a State entity under the Rehabilitation Act. In that case, you held that the suit could go forward even though the State entity was immune from suit under the 11th

Amendment. In your view, the State entity had agreed to waive its immunity in exchange for receiving Federal mass transit dollars.
I think this case is important. It is important to me, at least, Judge. It seems to show us what you think about Congress’s power under the Spending Clause, and it also gives us a model, I think, for how we might be able to protect those who are discriminated against under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Could you just take a moment—I have got 2 minutes left. Could you take a moment and tell us about the issue in the Barber case and what was your reasoning for permitting a disabled person to sue in Federal court for discrimination in that case?
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator DEWINE. It was your case. You were involved in the case. You were in the majority opinion. Judge ROBERTS. It was a divided decision. Senator DEWINE. Right, 2–1. Judge ROBERTS. The argument was whether Congress had the authority under the Spending Clause as a condition of the receipt of Federal funds that WMATA—the Metro here in D.C.—receives, that they waive their sovereign immunity to suit under the disability provisions, and the argument was that Congress lacked that authority, that they could not impose a waiver of sovereign immunity as a condition for the receipt of Federal funds to allow an individual alleging discrimination on the basis of disability to sue. There was no issue about whether there was sovereign immunity in the absence of a waiver, and the WMATA governing body was opposing the suit on the ground that it had not waived immunity. And they were arguing that Congress lacked the authority to condition the receipt of funds on a waiver of immunity. It was a divided decision, a 2–1 vote. The dissenter argued that this was an inappropriate exercise of the Spending Clause power. The majority concluded that, no, this was within Congress’s authority. It could condition the receipt of Federal funds on a waiver of sovereign immunity that allowed an individual alleging he was discriminated against in employment because of his disability to proceed with the suit. The arguments we rejected were arguments of germaneness. The idea was the funds were for transportation, not for employment, and so that it wasn’t a germane condition. The majority rejected those arguments. The dissent would have ruled the other way. Senator DEWINE. Judge, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator DeWine. Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. We are going to take a 15-minute break when Senator Feinstein concludes her questioning at about 4:15. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Judge Roberts. I want to follow up on something that Senator Kohl said in his last question, which was sort of asking you to do a look-back into some of the things you have written and said. And you have written—and this involves women—either in margin notes or in comments or in memos, and I want to list

for you some of the comments and ask you what do you think of them, what do you think of them today.
In a memorandum to Fred Fielding, White House Counsel under President Reagan, about the nomination of a woman to be recognized for moving from homemaker to lawyer, and your response to nominating this woman for an award was this: ‘‘Some might question whether encouraging homemakers to become lawyers contributes to the common good, but I suppose that’s for the judges to decide.’’
In a memo responding to a letter from three Republican Congresswomen that raised concerns about the pay gap that women experience, you said, and I quote, ‘‘Their slogan may as well be ‘From each according to his ability, to each according to her gender.’ ’’
You also wrote that the Congresswomen’s concerns ‘‘ignore the factors that explain that apparent disparity, such as seniority, the fact that many women frequently leave the workforce for extended periods of time,’’ et cetera.
In another memo, you implied that it is a canard that women are discriminated against because they receive 59 cents, at that time, to every $1 earned by men.
In a September 26, 1983, memo to Fred Fielding, you rejected an alternative proposed constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights to women.
In 1982, you wrote a memo to the then-Attorney General in which you refer to the task force which was to conduct a governmentwide review to determine those laws which discrminate on the basis of gender as ‘‘the Ladies Task Force.’’
I mention these examples to highlight what appears to be either a very acerbic pen or else you really thought that way. Did you really think that way? And do you think that way today?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I have always supported and support today equal rights for women, particularly in the workplace. I was very pleased when I saw, for example, the report of the National Association of Women Lawyers who went out and talked and interviewed with women lawyers who’ve worked with me, who’ve appeared before me, and the conclusion was that I not only always treated women lawyers with respect and equal dignity, but that I had made special accommodations for life-work issues to ensure that women could continue to progress, for example, at my law firm, and had already treated women who appeared before me in a perfectly professional way.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Then why say those things? Judge ROBERTS. Well, let’s take the first one you mentioned. It is to me obvious in the memo that I wrote to Fred Fielding that it was about whether or not it’s good to have more lawyers. Whether they were from homemakers, from plumbers, from artists or truck drivers had nothing to do with it. The point was: Is it good to have more lawyers? That’s the way I intended it, and I’m sure that’s the way— Senator FEINSTEIN. And you don’t think it was good to have more lawyers. Judge ROBERTS. I think there were probably—the point that Mr. Fielding and I had commented on, on many occasions, was that in

many areas there were too many lawyers, and that’s a common joke that goes back to Shakespeare. It has nothing to do with homemakers. The notion that that was my view is totally inconsistent and rebutted by my life. I married a lawyer. I was raised with three sisters who worked outside the home. I have a daughter for whom I will insist at every turn that she has equal citizenship rights with her brother.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Okay. I don’t want to belabor it. I am just trying to understand how you think, because you speak about modesty and humility, and yet none of these comments are modest or humble.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, those comments were in the nature of the tone that was encouraged in our office. It was a small office. They expected we turn projects around very quickly. We were expected to be candid, and if making a joke about lawyers would make for a more enjoyable day on the part of the people in the office, that’s what we did.
Senator FEINSTEIN. So it is fair to say you don’t think that way; is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t think in any way that is based on anything other than full equal citizenship rights on the basis of gender. I might tell a lawyer’s joke that there are too many lawyers today, but that’s all it was back then.
On the memo you quoted with respect to the issue of comparable worth, the one thing the memorandum made clear is that the position of the administration was there must be equal pay for equal work. That wasn’t the issue in that case. The issue there was whether there should be equal pay for different work and whether judges should determine what type of work was equal.
Senator FEINSTEIN. I am not arguing that. I am just arguing what you said—or bringing to your attention what you said then. But I don’t want to belabor it. I think you have answered the question.
Let me ask you a question on Canterino v. Wilson. This is about the same time, in 1982. And you pointed out in answers to prior questions that you were staff and you generally did what people asked you to do. In this case, William Bradford Reynolds, the top attorney in the Civil Rights Division, indicated that there had been substantial, he thought, discrimination in prisons in Kentucky and that the Justice Department had done an investigation and they found that male prisoners were given training for higher-paid jobs, for a greater variety of jobs, and were given training for longer periods of time. Your memo contradicted his recommendation to intervene.
Why would that be if you just follow the policy of the office? Judge ROBERTS. My understanding there was that there was a question whether intervention in that case—the case was being pursued by private litigants already—a question whether intervention by the Federal Government in that case was consistent with the Attorney General’s approach to institutional litigation. That was an approach that he had laid out in several speeches, memoranda, and, as a staff member, it was my job to call to his attention areas where I thought there may be inconsistencies in areas where he wanted to set policy priorities.

Senator FEINSTEIN. In response to the Chairman’s question this morning about the right to privacy, you answered that you believe that there is an implied right to privacy in the Constitution, that it has been there for some 80 years, and that a number of provisions in the Constitution support this right, and you enumerated them this morning.
Do you then believe that this implied right of privacy applies to the beginning of life and the end of life?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, first of all, I don’t necessarily regard it as an implied right. It is the part of the liberty that is protected under the Due Process Clause. That liberty is enumerated—
Senator FEINSTEIN. Part of liberty. Judge ROBERTS. Yes, and the exact scope of it with respect to the beginning of life and the end of life, those are issues that are coming before the Court in both respects. And I don’t think I should go further to elaborate upon whether or not it applies in those particular situations. Obviously, it has been articulated by the Court in both contexts, the Cruzan case with respect to the end of life, the Glucksberg case following Cruzan. But I don’t think it’s appropriate for me, given the fact that cases arise on both of those questions, to go further. Senator FEINSTEIN. All right. Let’s move right along. This morning, there was a discussion about stare decisis, and you pointed out that there were factors in consideration of stare decisis. And I think one of the things you said was workability of framework is one of the main principles you look for in stare decisis. Well, in its decision in Casey, the Court specifically affirmed the doctrine of stare decisis as it applies to Roe. The Court reviewed prudential and pragmatic considerations to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling that case. In doing so, the Court unambiguously concluded that Roe has in no sense proven unworkable. Do you agree with this conclusion? Judge ROBERTS. Well, that is—that determination in Casey becomes one of the precedents of the Court entitled to respect, like any other precedent of the Court, under principles of stare decisis. I have tried to draw the line about not agreeing or disagreeing with particular rulings, but that is a precedent of the Court. It is a precedent on precedent; in other words, it has examined Roe— Senator FEINSTEIN. So you agree that the Court said that, obviously. Judge ROBERTS. Well, it said that, and that is a precedent entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis, like any other precedent of the Court. But in terms of a separate determination on my part whether this decision is correct or that decision is correct, my review of what other nominees have done is that that is where they draw the line and that is where I have drawn the line. Senator FEINSTEIN. So workability is clearly one thing. Is another one reliance? Judge ROBERTS. Certainly, or as it is often expressed in the Court’s opinions, settled expectations. People expect that the law is going to be what the Court has told them the law is going to be. And that’s an important consideration.

Senator FEINSTEIN. And in Casey, again, the Court stated, and I quote, ‘‘The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives,’’ and that this ability to control their reproductive lives was enough of a reliance to sustain Roe, correct?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s what the Court—I think you’re reading from the plurality, the joint opinion in the case.
Senator FEINSTEIN. That is correct. Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator FEINSTEIN. That is correct. Now, unlike my experience, there are now entire generations of women who know a world only where their reproductive rights are protected. Do you agree with the Court that this reliance is sufficient? Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, I think that’s asking me whether I think the decision was correct or not on that point. It certainly was the analysis of the joint opinion in the Court, entitled to respect as precedent like any other decision of the Court under principles of stare decisis. And that would certainly be where I would begin if any of these issues come before the Court if I were to be confirmed. I would begin with the precedent that the Court has laid out in this area. Senator FEINSTEIN. One other question on Casey, and I would like to quote from something that Justice Ginsburg said in the transcript in her confirmation hearing in a discussion with thenSenator Brown. ‘‘The Casey majority understood that marriage and family life is not always what we might wish them to be. There are women whose physical safety, even their lives, would be endangered if the law required them to notify their partner, and Casey, which in other respects has been greeted in some quarters with great distress, answered a significant question, one left open in Roe. Casey held a State could not require notification to the husband.’’ Do you agree? Judge ROBERTS. That is what Casey held, yes, and that, as I said before, the precedent of the Court, like any other precedent of the Court, is entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. One other reading from Justice Ginsburg’s testimony. ‘‘Abortion prohibition by the State, however, controls women and denies them full autonomy and full equality with men. That was the idea I tried to express in the lecture to which you referred. The two strands, equality and autonomy, both figure in the full portrayal.’’ Do you agree or disagree? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think Justice—then Judge Ginsburg felt at greater liberty to discuss that precisely for the reason you noted, that she’d given a lecture on the subject. Those are issues that come up again and again before the Court. Consistent with what I understand the approach to have been of other nominees, I don’t think I should express a view on that. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. I would like to move on. In Bray, you argued on behalf of the Government as Deputy Solicitor General that the right to have an abortion is not specific to one gender. Specifically, your brief stated, quote, ‘‘unlike the condition of being pregnant, the right to have an abortion is not a fact that is specific to one gender,’’ end quote. In your oral argument, you went on to

make this point by comparing Operation Rescue’s attempts to prevent a woman from exercising her privacy right to make decisions about her pregnancy to an ecologist’s efforts to block an Indian tribe from using their exclusive fishing rights. Do you think that is an appropriate analogy?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, it was a position and an argument that the administration made that was accepted by the Supreme Court by a vote of six to three. The point, underlying point was that under the statute at issue in Bray, the Ku Klux Klan Act required under the Supreme Court’s precedents that people engaged in the challenged activity must be motivated by a discriminatory animus. Obviously, under the Ku Klux Klan Act, the classic case, racial hostility.
And the issue was, are people opposed, in the Bray case, opposed to abortion opposed to women, and the determination of the Court was that, no, that there are people who are opposed to abortion and that does not constitute opposition or discriminatory animus against women and, therefore, that the Ku Klux Klan Act didn’t apply. Many other provisions obviously apply in the case of abortion protestor violence, including State law and other provisions of Federal law. But the Supreme Court concluded six to three that there is no discriminatory animus based on opposition to abortion.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. I would like to move to another subject because my time is moving on, and that is what has been happening in the Court in the last 10 years. As I mentioned, for 60 years, the Court didn’t strike down a single Federal law for exceeding congressional power under the Commerce Clause. Yet in the last decade, the Court’s reinterpretation of the Commerce Clause has been used to strike down more than three dozen cases. The Court’s future decisions will determine whether the Congress will be able to take necessary action to stop child pornography, combat violent crime, ensure child support payments, prevent discrimination, improve our schools, and protect our environment.
My question is, do you agree with the direction in which the Supreme Court has moved in more narrowly interpreting congressional authority to enact laws under the Commerce Clause?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, of course, I tried to avoid saying whether I agree or disagree with particular cases. But I would point out in this area, in particular, I think it’s very important to look at the most recent case, which is the Raich case, the medical marijuana case, because the argument there was that these two decisions that you’re talking about that were the first in the 60 years, Lopez and Morrison, the argument there was based on Lopez and Morrison, Congress lacks the power in this area.
And what the Supreme Court said in the Raich case, which I think is very important, it said there are a lot more precedents on the Commerce Clause besides Lopez and Morrison, and the appropriate way to regard those is two decisions in the more than 200year sweep of decisions in which the Supreme Court has given extremely broad—it’s recognized extremely broad authority on Congress’s part, going all the way back to Gibbons v. Ogden and Chief Justice John Marshall, when those Commerce Clause decisions were important in binding the Nation together as a single commercial unit.

So again, without commenting on whether particular decisions are correct or not, I do think it’s important to recognize that the Court itself in its most recent decision has said we need to focus on the broad sweep and not just on those two decisions.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me move to the case of the hapless toad, known more commonly as Rancho Viejo v. Norton. Do you believe there is a basis for sustaining the Endangered Species Act other than the Commerce Clause?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the opinion I wrote there noted that the panel decision that I thought should be reheard en banc looked at one ground for under the Commerce Clause and the concluding paragraph in my opinion said that we ought to rehear the case to look at other grounds that were also under the Commerce Clause, but they were not the particular prong of the Commerce Clause analysis that the panel opinion had relied on, and the reason was that, as I explained in the opinion, another circuit court has suggested pointedly that the approach in the panel opinion was inconsistent with the Supreme Court.
And I thought if there was another basis for sustaining the Endangered Species Act that was not inconsistent in the view of another circuit court, that we ought to look at that and try to do it. It really reflects a restrained and minimalist approach. If there’s a ground that doesn’t cause another circuit court to say, you’re violating the Supreme Court precedents, we ought to look at that and see if we could rest the decision there.
Senator FEINSTEIN. I guess the point I am trying to get at is you are saying that the fact that the toad was almost only found in California means that it was an impermissible use of the Endangered Species Act. Well, then that raises a question. What if the toad strays across the border, or what if this is the last remaining toad, and—
Judge ROBERTS. Right, but the one point I would emphasize is my opinion did not conclude that there was no authority under the Commerce Clause in just that situation. There was another dissenting opinion that was filed by another judge who said this violates the Commerce Clause. I did not join that opinion. I wrote separately to say that we should hear this en banc with all the judges because there are other ways of sustaining this Act that don’t implicate the concern that has caused the other circuit to question our approach that had caused the dissenting judge to conclude there was no authority, and I thought we ought to look at those other grounds because if we could sustain it without implicating that objection, that would be better all around.
I did not take the position that it was outside the scope of the Commerce Clause. It was a question of which ground under the Commerce Clause we ought to look at.
Senator FEINSTEIN. There is a great deal of concern as what this then means for the implication for all environmental law—the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act. But if I understand you correctly, what you are saying is that you do not believe that the Commerce Clause should prohibit legislation in this area, is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. I have not had occasion to decide that. I did not decide it in the Rancho Viejo case. One of the other judges did and

227
I did not join that opinion. What I said is we should consider these other grounds. Now, I didn’t have the opportunity, because there was a dissent from rehearing, to consider those other grounds.
Those other grounds were what other courts, the Fifth Circuit in the GDF case, had used to sustain application of the Endangered Species Act in the cases that came before them. They didn’t get into the question of whether you look at the regulated activity, the building or the actual what was prohibited, the taking of the toad. They analyzed the protection of the endangered species as implicating a commercial activity, and that allowed them to sustain the Act without regard to whether it had an interstate effect itself.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. I would like to ask a question or two on church and state. I mentioned in my opening statement that for centuries, people have been persecuted for their religious beliefs, and our country grows more diverse every day and tensions among different beliefs have grown. I really believe that there is a brilliance in what the Founding Fathers did in drafting the First Amendment and how it protected an individual’s right to practice their belief, whatever it may be, but also protect against using religion against individuals by prohibiting the government from becoming and/or imposing religion.
In 1960, there was much debate about President John F. Kennedy’s faith and what role Catholicism would play in his administration. At that time, he pledged to address the issues of conscience out of a focus on the national interest, not out of adherence to the dictates of one’s religion, and even said, ‘‘I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.’’
My question is, do you? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I think the reason we have the two clauses in the Constitution in the First Amendment reflects the Framers’ experience. Many of them or their immediate ancestors were fleeing religious persecution. They were fleeing established churches. And it makes perfect sense to put those two provisions together, no establishment of religion and guaranteeing free exercise. That reflected the Framers’ experience. Senator FEINSTEIN. If you can, answer my question yes or no. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t know what you mean by absolute separation of church and state. For example, recently in the Ten Commandments case, the Court upheld a monument on the Texas capitol grounds that had the Ten Commandments in it. They struck down the posting of the Ten Commandments in a Kentucky courthouse. Is it correct to call the monument on the Texas capitol grounds with the Ten Commandments, is that an absolute separation, or is that an accommodation of a particular monument, along with others, that five of the Justices found was consistent with the First Amendment? So I don’t know what that means when you say absolute separation. I do know this, that my faith and my religious beliefs do not play a role in judging. When it comes to judging, I look to the law books and always have. I don’t look to the Bible or any other religious source. Senator FEINSTEIN. It has been reported that during your meeting with Senator Wyden, while discussing end-of-life issues, you cited the dissent of Justice Brandeis in Olmstead. I would like to

quote from it. ‘‘The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized the significance of man’s spiritual nature, of his feelings, and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure, and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions, and their sensations. They conferred as against the Government the right to be left alone, the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. To protect that right, every unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a violation of the Fourth Amendment.’’
Do you agree with Justice Brandeis? Judge ROBERTS. I agree with his expression that it’s a basic right to be left alone and I think that animating principle is a very important one. With regard to particular restrictions he was talking about, wiretapping, or I forget how the interception actually at issue there, I don’t think it’s appropriate to comment on. But as a general statement of the principle, and again, it reflects just the basic understanding that it’s a free country and the right to be left alone is one of our basic rights. I do agree with that. Senator FEINSTEIN. I do think the implication of what you said to Senator Wyden, and I have discussed this with him, was that one has the right to make their end-of-life decision. Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s an issue that is before the Court in particular cases and I can’t comment on a case that’s coming before the Court. If I am confirmed, I would have to confront that case with an open mind in light of the arguments presented, in light of the precedents of the Court, and the litigants in those cases are entitled to have judges that haven’t expressed views on that particular case. Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, let me ask you this question, then. In an interview on PBS after the Court ruled in Washington v. Glucksberg, a case involving a State statute that banned assisted suicide, you said, ‘‘I think it’s important not to have too narrow a view of protecting personal rights.’’ What did you mean by that? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I went on to explain that the right—any time there’s an assertion of a right, there’s quite often an assertion of a contrary right. I think it was similar to a point Senator Kyl was making earlier, that, for example, if you’re asserting a right against government regulation, then the right of the people to regulate through their elected representatives that’s being struck down, that right is being restricted. So it’s usually not—it’s often not, we could view that as a right on one side and there’s nothing on the other side. But there’s often an assertion of a right on the other side. And what the courts have to do is make sure they provide a level playing field in which people disputing the impact of the Constitution, on whose right prevails, have judges who will decide that case according to the rule of law, and not according to whether they think one right should prevail or another. Senator FEINSTEIN. But do you believe then that the Federal Court should become involved in end-of-life decisions?

Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, that is exactly one of the questions that’s before the Court, and I can’t answer that in the abstract. I have to answer that on the basis of the parties’ arguments, on the basis of the record in the case, on the basis of the precedents. An abstract opinion that would prejudge that case would be inappropriate for a nominee to express.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me ask it another way. Do you believe that the Court should have a limited role in that situation?
Judge ROBERTS. I think courts have a limited role in general, and that is that they only interpret the law, they don’t make the law, they don’t shape the policy. Now, the application of that basic principle, which is very important to me, in a particular case is obviously something that hospitable to wait for the litigation of that case, the arguments in that case, the arguments of the lawyers about whether it’s consistent with the precedents or inconsistent with the precedents, but the basic principle, the courts should not be shaping public policy—that’s for the legislators—is a fundamental principle with which I agree.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Since I announced the break at 4:15, I have been advised that there is a vote at 4:30. So Senator Sessions has graciously agreed to split his 30-minute round, 15 minutes, and then we will go vote. So we will now turn to Senator Sessions for 15 minutes, and we will break at that time and take a 15-minute break to go vote. Senator SESSIONS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, I want to congratulate you on your excellent testimony. You have validated the President’s confidence in you. Many people said President Bush obviously looked around and looked around and finally decided to choose the best, and I think you have proven that correctly. The ABA has rated you unanimously, American Bar Association, in their formal rating process, unanimously rated you ‘‘well-qualified,’’ the highest possible rating that they give. They have quite a number of lawyers that vote on that, so to get a unanimous vote is not that frequent. And for a higher office, they have a higher standard, and I think that is particularly worthwhile that you received that recognition. I note that some of our legal professional journals have given you remarkable accolades. The American Lawyer, in 2004, wrote that you were ‘‘one of the Supreme Court’s finest practitioners.’’ And the Legal Times said you are ‘‘one of the top appellate lawyers of your generation.’’ And the Legal Times also said that you are ‘‘viewed by many as the best Supreme Court advocate in private law firm practice.’’ Those are high praise, and I think today we have seen why people would think that of you. I also would offer for the record, Mr. Chairman, a letter from former Democratic Attorney General Bill Baxley from Alabama. He prosecuted the first prosecution of the church bombing cases in Birmingham successfully. He is a lifelong Democrat. As he notes, an elected member of the State Democratic Executive Committee. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection it will be made a part of the record.

Senator SESSIONS. He said this, ‘‘Senator, I know Judge Roberts well. I have entrusted three important appellate matters to him. In each instance I met with him and engaged him in extensive conversation upon a wide range of topics because he is a man of such remarkable intellectual brilliance. I sought him out on private as well as professional topics, enjoyed more than one meal with him, and was each time overwhelmed not only by his intelligence, but also his innate sense of fairness, by his sensitivity to every aspect and angle of consideration of every issue addressed by him, and by his somber sense of decency and justice.’’ A somber sense of decency and justice, pretty good phrase.
‘‘My love of my country surpasses politics,’’ Mr. Baxley says. ‘‘It compels me to support Judge Roberts in every possible way in order that justice might most effectively prevail in the United States Supreme Court. I am confident in the ability of Judge Roberts to fairly, and without any agenda of any kind, address each legal issue which comes before him. I am equally confident of his ability to lead the Supreme Court in an administrative capacity. I have no doubt that the diverse opinions of each Associate Justice sitting on the United States Supreme Court will receive greater deference and consideration under his leadership than under any other Chief Justice with whom they have ever served. This wise and circumspect man deserves this office.’’
So I think we have seen a great bipartisan recognition of your capabilities, and the respect that you have reaches broadly.
Also recall, Judge Roberts, that in my opening statement, I suggested that the pattern around here is to take out old statements and memoranda and bring them up out of context, and that particularly the outside groups and sometimes Senators would get confused, or sometimes these groups I think deliberately have attempted to paint a picture of you or the positions you took that are not fair or accurate.
I just would want to go over a few cases and deal with some of the issues that you have already been questioned with to make sure that we are square about it.
On the Gwinnett case, the Title IX, the women’s education case, the position you took that would deny the right to sue a State entity, a government entity for money damages, was that not a position consistent with the position of the court of appeals that had written the only opinion on that subject?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, that was the court of appeals position. Senator SESSIONS. So you, in advocating that position, were expressing a view that was the view of the highest Federal court in the land at that time? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SESSIONS. With respect to the Grove City case, it was good that Senator Grassley from Iowa knew about that, and I think he clarified that question well here. With regard to Bolden v. City of Mobile, you and Senator Kennedy had an exchange. Well, I am from Mobile. I was not involved in the litigation, but know something about that litigation. When the exchange ended, as I recall, Senator Kennedy was insisting that the Zimmer case was the established law, and there are a number of cases had said that effects tests applied, whereas you

231
were contending that at the time you took the position you did, that the Supreme Court had ruled that an intent standard was required, and that Bolden set the decision on that. I guess the question for us today, who was right, you or Senator Kennedy?
Judge ROBERTS. Well— Senator SESSIONS. I did not want to ask you, but go ahead. Judge ROBERTS. No. I don’t— Senator SESSIONS. If I say the— Judge ROBERTS. It was a renewal of a debate that was had between the administration and Senator Kennedy 20 plus years ago, and certainly the issue of whether the Supreme Court had interpreted Section 2 and what it had said and whether or not it was correct, was mooted. Senator Kennedy’s position eventually prevailed as a matter of legislation. Through the good offices of Senator Dole and others, the compromise was worked out, and the totality of the circumstances test enacted under Section 2. Senator SESSIONS. But the truth is, is it not, that Bolden v. City of Mobile had been decided by the Supreme Court, and the Bolden v. City of Mobile said that you had to show, when you consider a form of a local government, that before you could throw it out, create a new government for that city, you had to show that it was designed in a way to intentionally deny equal rights to the minority citizens. Judge ROBERTS. That was my understanding of, and certainly the administration’s understanding of Mobile and its interpretation of Section 2. And as I said, the debate was largely mooted by the legislative change that was enacted. Senator SESSIONS. I am just trying to get this thing straight because I do not want anybody to be misinterpreted. Bolden v. City of Mobile quoted Zimmer. It was the final word on the matter, and it ruled that before the Federal Government could throw out a government of a city and require a new government to be established, there had to be an intent to discriminate, and that was consistent with the Voting Rights Act. And then when the Voting Rights Act came up for reauthorization, the legislature, the Congress passed a law and changed the law that in effect said the effects test, if it had the effect of discriminating or keeping African-American citizens from being elected to office, that that could justify the removal of the existing form of government and establish a new government. Judge ROBERTS. That’s right, and it is in many areas—well, certainly every area involving interpretation of the statute—the final say is not with the Supreme Court. The final say on a statute is with Congress, and if they don’t like the Supreme Court’s interpretation of it, they can change it, and that’s what happened in this case. Senator SESSIONS. Well, the Voting Rights Act, let me say, is a tremendous critical, historical event. It transformed the South. I think Senator Kennedy or others said that grandchildren and children today are being able to vote because of this right, and that is true. Not only are they being able to vote, they are being able to be judges who supervise elections, sheriffs, mayors, city councilmen, county commissioners. Alabama has more elected AfricanAmerican officeholders than any other State in America, and we

232
are proud of that. But this was a powerful Act, and it did change the makeup of county commissions, city commissions, statewide boards, all over Alabama, all over America, and it was a big step. But the Congress made that, and you were correct when you said that your position was consistent with what the Supreme Court ruled at that time.
With regard to the question of comparable work, I think Senator Feinstein was clear about this, but I would like to make it a little bit clearer. You have consistently favored equal pay for equal work, have you not, and did not President Reagan also favor that explicitly and openly?
Judge ROBERTS. Absolutely. Senator SESSIONS. It is the question of this comparable worth theory that apparently one district court found in favor of, but that every circuit court and every other court that considered it, rejected it, that said that some body, some commission, I guess, would decide whether a secretary should be paid as much as a truck driver and make those kind of value judgment decisions. Is that not the difference between those two aspects? Judge ROBERTS. That’s right. Yeah, there is no question of equal pay for equal work. It’s the idea that someone should decide that different jobs are of comparable worth and that therefore they should be paid the same. And the district court adopted that approach, was reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an opinion by then-Judge Anthony Kennedy. Senator SESSIONS. That is right. I know he did right on that, and I think that the Sixth, Seventh, Tenth and Ninth Circuits all rejected that idea, and frankly, it has not been heard from since. I am glad that you and President Reagan did not agree to that at the time. We would have commissions of incredible complexity trying to decide very important matters. The National Academy of Sciences, in fact, found and declared it did not believe that the value of worth of jobs could be determined by fair and scientific methods. So I think that is important. Judge Roberts, I tried a lot of cases in Federal district court. I have written appeals to the Federal appellate courts and argued a few times in the court of appeals. I would like for you to help explain to us how this court system works and what an appellate judge does. I mean appellate judges do not go about to set policy in America. They do not go out to supervise and superintend the legislative and executive branches. They decide cases that come before them. So is it not true that normally a case would be initiated in a Federal district court of a State trial court, and a trial would be held, often with a jury, and a judgment is rendered? Judge ROBERTS. That’s what most people, most of us think of when we think of going to court. You’re there. You know, you bring in the witnesses. They testify, they’re cross-examined by the other side. There’s one judge supervising the trial. If it’s a jury case the jury is there. That’s where most of the fact finding takes place. People have different versions of events, you know, who was there, what did they do? And people tell different stories, and that is where you try to sort that out, either before the jury or the single judge.

233
Senator SESSIONS. And a judge has to rule, he has to rule on evidentiary matters or legal matters, and sometimes a judge is in the midst of trial and maybe he makes an error maybe he does not make an error. But every word of that trial is put down, is recorded. And so after the trial if the losing party is unhappy, they can take an appeal, and when they do that, it goes to the Federal court of appeals for that circuit, and they point out to the court of appeals where they think the judge made an error. And they say, this was wrong and we want a new trial judge, or remittitur, or some other remedy. Is that not what happens?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s right. The big difference, when you get up to the court of appeals, is that the facts are not really in play any more. Somebody’s been determined—they think you’re guilty or they buy your version of events. The court of appeals usually just looks at the legal issues. Somebody says, ‘‘The judge made a mistake. He shouldn’t have let that witness testify, or he should have recognized that the police had no authority to conduct that search’’ in a criminal case. And that’s appealed to the court of appeals, where in the Federal system there are three judges, and they’re just looking at that legal question. And they just go back and look at the law, the precedents, and determine whether or not the law was correctly applied in the trial court of if mistake had been made and they need to do it over again.
Senator SESSIONS. And if they appeal, the lawyers write sometimes beautiful, carefully written briefs that point out the reasons why they think an error may or may not have occurred; is that not correct?
Judge ROBERTS. As a court of appeals judge, that’s exactly the kind of brief you’re looking for, and every now and then you get one.
[Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. And sometimes when you read the first brief, you are persuaded, and when you read the second brief you think maybe it was not as clear as you thought it was when you read the first one. Judge ROBERTS. Not just sometimes, Senator, quite often that’s my reaction. That’s part of the adversary system, and you need to have lawyers doing a good job presenting the best arguments on either side so you can feel comfortable that you’re making as good a decision as you can. Senator SESSIONS. So the lawyers in the case and the clients and the parties want a judge who will carefully read those briefs and be fair and careful in analyzing whether or not they got a fair trial to ensure justice took place. Judge ROBERTS. That’s what I was always looking for when I was a lawyer, Senator, yes. Senator SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I see the clock is going around in circles down there, I think. What do you want to do about time? Chairman SPECTER. Well, they have not started the vote, and we all know that that is not totally predictable even when they say 4:30. Would you care to continue until the vote starts? Senator SESSIONS. I would be pleased if the Chairman—do you know what my time is now?

Chairman SPECTER. You can run the red to—well, it just went off.
Senator SESSIONS. This is like a football referee, put so much time back on the clock. It says a minute left.
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. You can run the red till 7 minutes and 30 seconds. Senator SESSIONS. All right, very good. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. Who am I to disagree with the Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Senator Sessions, if you would— Senator SESSIONS. I will have 15 minutes after this? Chairman SPECTER. You have 15 minutes left, yes. Start the clock back at 15 minutes. Senator SESSIONS. Okay, good. Thank you. The doctor down here is good at mathematics. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. Businessman, too. But it is even more complicated than that in doing justice, and on the Supreme Court if a case comes up to you, you will probably have briefs from both parties. You will receive the transcript of the trial that the issue arises from, and you will study that. And you have several law clerks who will help you study that. And every one of the 9 Supreme Court Justices are also studying this same record and all these briefs. Is it not true that friends of the Court can submit briefs? Judge ROBERTS. At Supreme Court level that’s very common, and in some cases there are quite literally hundreds of so-called ‘‘friends of the Court’’ or amicus briefs. Different organizations that are interested in a particular ruling and have a particular perspective, a few of them are even helpful. Senator SESSIONS. So you review that, and then you frequently set the case, or normally set the case for oral argument. Judge ROBERTS. If the Supreme Court decides to—this is of course a very big part of their function. They get some 10,000 petitions every year, people saying, ‘‘I want you to hear my case.’’ You know, all lawyers say they’re going to take it all the way to the Supreme Court, 10,000 people try to do that every year. These days the Court hears about 80 of those, 80 of those 10,000. And the selection of which 80 to take is obviously a big part of the Court’s function. But once they have selected those 80 cases, then they go in and have new briefs on the merits, and all these amicus briefs are filed from different organizations presenting their arguments or their particular perspective, and then it’s set for argument. Senator SESSIONS. So the lawyers from both sides then appear before the Court over in the Supreme Court Building, and they answer questions and make their presentations as to why they think the Court should rule the way they would like it to. Judge ROBERTS. They usually get an hour for the whole case, so each side gets a half-hour, and that half-hour is taken up almost entirely by the Justices’ questions. I went back once and counted the questions during my half-hour, and there were over a hundred questions. Obviously some of them are rapid-fire questions, and if
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00246 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

235
you follow the Court, you could probably guess who was asking those, and others were more elaborate questions, but more than a hundred in a half-hour.
So the job of the lawyer there is to be totally prepared to answer all of those questions. And, of course, some of them are going to lead into traps, and you have to be careful about that. Others are going to be the very difficult questions that the Court is eventually going to base its decision on. But it’s a very both exhilarating and demanding process to go through an oral argument before the Supreme Court.
Senator SESSIONS. And I think there is little doubt that you are the best practitioner of it in the country. But with regard to that, you then finish, and do the judges then meet in conference to discuss the case?
Judge ROBERTS. They do. The Justices, each of whom has prepared the case by not only reading all these briefs and attending the argument, talking it over with their law clerks, but also reading back over the cases, the precedents that the lawyers have been arguing about, they go back and look at those, and then just the Justices in the conference room—no clerks, no staff, just the nine Justices sit in the conference room and talk about it, thrash out the case, eventually get to a point where they take a vote on what they think the disposition should be, the decision should either be affirmed or reversed, or sometimes something else in between, half affirmed, half reversed, sent back, whatever. And then the opinion is assigned, and that’s still very much part of the process, the writing of the opinion, because quite often—or maybe not quite often, but often enough, the Justices find out that as they try to write a particular opinion, different problems come up. It doesn’t seem as— it’s not writing as they thought it would, and sometimes they have to go back and revisit the case because the Justice assigned the opinion decides that it’s not—it should come out the other way or there should be a different reason, a different basis for the decision.
And then once the Justice who’s writing it is comfortable with the opinion, they send it around to all the other chambers, and the individual Justices, if they agree with it, they send a memo around to everybody else that says, ‘‘Please join me.’’ That’s just the jargon the Justices use. It means, ‘‘Please join my name to your opinion.’’ And sometimes they will have suggestions. You know, I’d be happy to join your opinion, but I disagree with this section, or I disagree with this footnote, or I disagree with this line of reasoning. If you could change that, I’d be able to join.
Well, if you’re a Justice who’s getting—this is the first reaction you’ve gotten, the first vote back, you might be a little more willing to make a change to accommodate that suggestion. If you’ve got seven votes already in the bank and somebody says please change this or change that, maybe you’re a little less willing because maybe then some of the others say, well, now I’m not happy with that change. And it can obviously get to be a very complicated process as the memos fly back and forth and the Court tries to come to some consensus around an opinion.
Often, maybe too often, there’s not total agreement, and somebody will write a dissent and send that around. And others will join that.

Concurrence, you know, I can’t agree with your reason, but I agree with the result, and so I’m writing separately to give you my reasons.
And the balance changes. Somebody can write a concurrence, and all of a sudden they’ve got five votes, and it’s the majority, and the other majority, the original majority becomes the concurrence. But it’s a—the analysis is done at—and this has been my experience on the court of appeals as well—a very high level, and I think it’s critically important that it’s just the Justices alone who go into the conference room, just as on my court now it’s just the judges who go into their conference room, because judges and Justices in that situation can be a lot more open with their views. And it’s been quite common in my experience over the past more than 2 years to have a judge say, ‘‘This is how I view the case,’’ and then another judge say, ‘‘Well, what about this?’’ And the judge can say, ‘‘Well, I hadn’t thought about that’’ or ‘‘The record says this.’’ And you get out the record, put it out there and look at it.
Senator SESSIONS. But at some point you agree to sign on an opinion, one way or the other.
Judge ROBERTS. Right. Senator SESSIONS. And that becomes a decision of the judge and maybe the majority of the Court, or maybe a dissent, but that is a decision that is made. Isn’t that why you should not in this hearing today blithely start expressing opinions on complex matters when you haven’t been through that process and start prejudging matters before you have read the briefs, before you have read the transcript, before you have heard the arguments, before you have talked to your clerks, before you have discussed it with other judges? Isn’t that the essence of what justice is, this careful process that leads us to as fair a result as humanly possible? Judge ROBERTS. I think that’s perfectly accurate, and if you’ve had the experience, as I know every judge and every Justice has, of having your original view changed when you read either the other side’s brief in a case, after reading the opening brief, or had your view changed as a result of the discussion at conference, or had your view changed when you tried to write the opinion one way and it came out the other way, then you appreciate the significance of that process. And it’s a total distortion and a perversion of that process to start out by saying, well, you know, I testified under oath that I thought this decision was correct, so I’m done, you know, no need to read the briefs, no need to listen to the arguments, no need to go into conference and talk with the other judges on the bench, I’ve already given my view under oath. Or even if you are going to be open to reconsideration, to start with that barrier, I testified under oath that this is the correct approach, that this is the right result, now maybe you can persuade me otherwise, well, that’s not the burden that the litigant should have to take. The litigant should be able to know that all of the judges, all of the Justices that that person is arguing before have an open mind and are fully open to the process. Senator SESSIONS. You wouldn’t want to call Senator Biden and ask his permission to change the commitment you made, would you? Just a joke there a little bit. [Laughter.]

Senator SESSIONS. You don’t want to have to read a transcript of this hearing about the time when you try to decide how to rule on a case to make sure you didn’t make some commitment. I mean, I think that is all I wanted to—the point I would like to make there.
You know, Senator Specter came right out of the chute asking you about stare decisis and Roe and other related type matters, and that is an important question. As I understand it, you committed to Senator Specter that you would bring no hidden agendas to this matter, that you would consider any case that came up under Roe or any other case that might impact stare decisis, and that you would apply a reasonable, professional analysis to that, drawing on the history of courts and their opinions in dealing with these cases, and would try to make a fair and honest and objective decision. Is that what I understood you to say?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s what I understood my testimony to be, yes, Senator.
Senator SESSIONS. And you are not saying one way or the other how you would rule on Roe or some of the other cases that have been—
Judge ROBERTS. No. I feel that it would be very inappropriate for me as a nominee to tell how I would rule on a particular case that might come before the Court.
Senator SESSIONS. Well, I would like to know how you would rule on a lot of those cases, too, but I didn’t ask you when you came and talked with me, and I don’t think it is appropriate. I don’t think those of us who are politically conservative ought to look to the courts to promote our conservative agenda through the manipulation of interpreting words of the Constitution or statutes. I don’t think liberals have a right to ask the Court to promote their agenda by twisting the plain meaning of words to accomplish an agenda.
What we need is what you said, an umpire, fair and objective, that calls it like they see it based on the discrete case that comes before the judge. And I think that is most important.
I would just say I don’t know the answer to those questions legally, how it will all come out, but I would just offer that polling data continues to show that young people and numbers in general are showing that the people are more hostile to abortion than they used to be. Perhaps it is seeing the sonograms and those kind of things. Seventy-five percent, according to a Harris survey, said that they didn’t think an abortion was proper in the second trimester; 85 percent said they didn’t think it was proper in the last trimester.
I just saw an interesting article by Mr. Benjamin Wittes. He writes for the Washington Post. He declares he is pro-choice, and he says, ‘‘Let go of Roe.’’ And he goes into an analysis of it. He said, ‘‘I am not necessarily thinking Roe ought to legally be overturned, but if it does die, I won’t attend its funeral, nor would I lift a finger to prevent a conservative President from nominating a Justice who might bury it once and for all.’’ This was in Atlantic Monthly, January of this year. And he goes on to say, ‘‘Roe puts liberals in the position of defending a lousy opinion. It disenfranchised millions of conservatives on an issue about which they care deeply, while free-

238
ing those conservatives from any obligation to articulate a responsible policy that might command majority support.’’ And he goes on, as have others, to say this: ‘‘The right to an abortion remains a highly debatable position, both jurisprudentially and morally.’’ And he also noted that, ‘‘In the years since the decision, an enormous body of academic literature has tried to put the right to an abortion on firmer legal ground, but thousands of pages of scholarship notwithstanding, the right to abortion remains a constitutionally shaky proposition. Abortion policy is a question that the Constitution, even broadly construed, cannot convincingly be read to resolve.’’
So that is one opinion. I am just saying you will have to deal with this, and I just don’t think that we ought to take the view that that matter is open and shut, and I hope that you—we will take you at your word that your mind is open and you will evaluate the matter fairly according to the high standards of justice that you can bring to bear to that issue, and any others like it that come up. Will you give us that commitment?
Judge ROBERTS. Absolutely, Senator. I would confront issues in this area as any other area, with an open mind, in light of the arguments, in light of the record, after careful consideration of the views of my colleagues on the bench. And I would confront these questions just as I would any others that come before the Court.
Senator SESSIONS. Well, I am of the view that the Constitution is a contract with the American people, that developments will occur that clearly fit within the ambit of a fair reading of that Constitution that were never contemplated by the Founders. Things do change, and we have to apply new circumstances. But wouldn’t you agree a judge should never make an opinion that is beyond what a fair interpretation of the Constitution would call for?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SESSIONS. Judge Roberts, thank you for responding to my questions and to those of the other members of this body. You have been open, honest, and direct in providing a great view of your judicial philosophy and how you approach cases. I appreciate the fact you have correctly avoided some questions, some you should not answer. You haven’t read the briefs and heard the arguments and thought about it. But you have carefully answered the appropriate questions, and we respect you for it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. The vote is now in process. We will recess until 5:05, at which point we will call on Senator Feingold for his 30 minutes of questioning. We stand in recess. [Recess 4:50 to 5:14 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume. We are just a little late in coming back because we were on the floor trying to figure out what the Senate schedule is going to be, when we would vote next. While that is uncertain, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that we will not vote until 7:30. That gives us latitude to move ahead with five more rounds, where we will finish at about 7:30, a little later because we are not starting quite at 5:00, 7:45.

So we will proceed with Senator Feingold now, and then Senator Graham from 5:30 to 6:00, Senator Schumer from 6:00 to 6:30, Senator Cornyn from 6:30 to 7:00, and Senator Durbin from 7:00 to 7:30. That is back by 15 minutes because we are 15 minutes slow coming out of the gate.
Senator LEAHY. Did you notice the look of sheer, undisguised glee on the face of Judge Roberts at the idea of going another three hours at this? Two hours?
Chairman SPECTER. I consulted with Senator Leahy, Judge Roberts, and the empirical evidence is overwhelming, without consultation, that you are fit to go indefinitely.
Judge ROBERTS. I’m ready to go. Chairman SPECTER. Is that judgment satisfactory to you— Judge ROBERTS. Absolutely. Chairman SPECTER.—Judge Roberts? Senator Feingold? Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, the eyes of America are on you this week thanks to what our generation called the miracle of live television. Television plays an enormous role in providing information and bringing the country together in times of national pride, like the liftoffs and the landings of spacecrafts and Presidential inaugurations, political conflict like the 2000 election and the 1999 impeachment trial of President Clinton, the great tragedy of September 11 and the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina. Americans can watch virtually every significant event of national importance on television except for oral arguments and announcement of decisions at the Supreme Court. If you are confirmed, you will essentially disappear from public view. This hearing will, in some ways, be the last time that the Nation will see you at work. The possibility of televising trials raises some complicated issues. We have to consider the safety and rights of criminal defendants and witnesses and jurors. But such concerns are not so present in the case of appellate proceedings. There is no doubt that there is enormous public interest in Supreme Court oral arguments, but not very many seats in the courthouse. I think it would benefit the country and the Court if all Americans had the chance to see the Court conduct its work, so I would like to know if you, as Chief Justice, will support televising the Court’s public proceedings. Judge ROBERTS. Senator, it’s not something that I have a settled view on and I do think it’s something that I would benefit from the views of my colleagues, and I know that some of them have particular views and some may not. I noticed the last time there was a formal response by the Court to a request to televise a particular argument, the Chief Justice referred the matter to the whole Court and then reported back on it. I’m also aware that there are—I’m not sure if the right word is experimental or trial efforts going on in some of the courts of appeals, the Federal courts of appeals, to televise arguments there, and I know I’ve watched them so I appreciate that opportunity. And I don’t know yet if there’s been an evaluation of how that experiment proceeded, whether the judges thought it went fine, the lawyers, or whatever. I just don’t know.

At the Supreme Court level, I do know they experimented recently in a few cases with releasing the audio tapes immediately after the conclusion of the argument. Again, I listened to those on occasion, not every case, but selected cases of particular interest. I know that on our court, my court, I’m sorry, on the court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit, we broadcast at least within the courthouse simultaneously the oral arguments, so I know that the technology is there to do that and I certainly understand the interest and I understand how—I know it was very well received to have the audio tapes immediately available in some of those cases—
Senator FEINGOLD. I hope you will seriously consider this. What has changed from our good conversation we had about this before is that now you will be the principal decision maker on this as the Chief Justice, and I hope you will give it serious consideration.
Judge Roberts, on September 11, 2001, obviously an event occurred that had a profound effect on all of us in this country. We all have our own memories of that day. During those first few hours after the attacks, I kept remembering a sentence from a case we both probably studied in law school.’’ Those words were, ‘‘while the Constitution protects against invasions of individual rights, it is not a suicide pact.’’
I took those words as a challenge to my concerns about civil liberties at that horrible time in our history. We have to be careful not to take civil liberties so literally that we allow ourselves to be destroyed. But then when I actually tracked down the case itself, not remembering what case it was from, it was Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, I found that Justice Arthur Goldberg made this statement, but then went on to rule in favor of the civil liberties position in this case. He actually affirmed the importance of civil liberties in wartime.
So I would like to start this part of my questions by asking you what kind of impact that day had on you and your belief system and whether it changed your view of the importance of individual rights and civil liberties and how they can be protected.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I remember the day vividly, Senator. I think I was one of the last people in the country to find out about it. I had entered—gone into a hearing. It was actually in an original action in the Supreme Court. The Special Master was at G.W. Law School and we had a hearing. I think it was starting a little before nine that day. We went in there.
I remember just as I was leaving getting a report that a plane had struck the World Trade Center, but it was—at the time, I thought it was, like, you know, one of those tour planes that was— I had no idea what they were reporting. I went into the proceeding and we conducted the hearing. It lasted several hours. Nobody notified us and we didn’t know about it.
I remember leaving and trying to walk back to my office—I was at the law firm then—and the street was blocked off and I figured, well, there’s something going on at the White House. I remember walking down further and it was still blocked off and still blocked off. I finally went up to one of these guards and I said, ‘‘What’s going on?’’ and he looked at me like, ‘‘Where have you been?’’ Only then did I begin to appreciate it. I went back to my office, because there was no way to get out of town by then—

241
Senator FEINGOLD. But at what point did you start thinking about the implications of this in terms of civil liberties and the challenges—
Judge ROBERTS. Well, it was when I went back to the office and saw the smoke rising from the Pentagon. As you can imagine, that was a chilling sight. The basic issue of how you address the question of civil liberties in wartime, in times of crisis, is a critically important one.
The Bill of Rights doesn’t change during times of war. The Bill of Rights doesn’t change in times of crisis. There may be situations where demands are different and they have to be analyzed appropriately so that things that might have been acceptable in times of war are not acceptable in times of peace. I think everyone appreciates that. But the Bill of Rights is not suspended and the obligation of the courts to uphold the rule of law is not suspended.
Senator FEINGOLD. Did you recognize at that moment that this might become a time when it would be harder to protect civil liberties?
Judge ROBERTS. I think—I don’t recall recognizing that in particular, but that is, of course, always the challenge in times of war and in times of stress, whatever the cause. I think it is the obligation of the courts to remember, just as really the model of the D.C. Circuit, from our earliest case, when the treason trial of Aaron Burr, to calmly poise the scales of justice. The emphasis is on calmly. It requires a certain dispassion, a certain separation from the passions of the moment.
Senator FEINGOLD. That is absolutely right and that is why I want to follow up on what Senator Leahy asked about earlier—a different time, a different challenge. As a Nation, we can now look back at wartime Supreme Court decisions like Korematsu v. United States with something like bewilderment. We talked about it earlier. To me, it seems inconceivable that the United States Government would have decided to put huge numbers of citizens in detention centers based on their race and that the Supreme Court would have deferred to the President’s decision to do so.
Do you believe that Korematsu was wrongly decided? Judge ROBERTS. It’s one of those cases that I don’t think it’s technically been overruled yet, but I think it’s widely recognized as not having precedential value. I do think the result in that case— Korematsu was actually the—considered the exclusion and not the actual detention, but the exclusion of individuals based on their ethnic/racial background from vast areas. It’s hard for me to comprehend the argument that that would be acceptable these days. Senator FEINGOLD. It is often included, if you list decisions that are sort of considered some of the worst decisions in the history of the Supreme Court— Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator FEINGOLD.—with Plessy v. Ferguson and Dred Scott and others. Is that a fair characterization of your view— Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator FEINGOLD.—of Korematsu? Judge ROBERTS. Yes.

242
Senator FEINGOLD. Are there any elements of the Government’s response to September 11 that you think 50 or 60 years from now we as a Nation will look back on with regret?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’m sure there are some, Senator, and when you have the benefit of 50 or 60 years to look back as opposed to the particular demands of the moment and the perceived demands, I’m sure it’s a different perspective. I’d hesitate to mention any in particular because so many of these issues are coming before not only the Supreme Court, but the court on which I now sit, and I will have to confront those cases, I think, regardless of what happens here. So I’d hesitate to identify particular areas of concern.
Senator FEINGOLD. I understand your caution. I don’t think we need to wait 50 or 60 years for some. For example, do you have any concerns about the practice of extraordinary rendition, of our Government secretly sending people to countries that we know use torture?
Judge ROBERTS. Again, Senator, that is something that could come before the Court in one form or another and I think I have to refrain from commenting on it.
Senator FEINGOLD. How about the Federal Government using immigration laws to round up and detain people for months, often without regard for whether they had any connection to the September 11 investigation, which actually in this case the Justice Department Inspector General later heavily criticized? Does that trouble you?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, yes, certainly, at a basic level of appreciating that this is a reaction in a particular way that raises serious questions. I’m very hesitant, though, again, to express a view on legality because those issues could come before the Court. They are coming before the Court, and they’re coming not only before the Supreme Court, but the court on which I now sit.
Senator FEINGOLD. Let’s go to one that has already come before the Court, the Hamdi case. It is one of the most significant recent decisions restraining executive branch power. In that case, eight members of the Court found that the Government had gone too far in claiming the right to detain and hold a U.S. citizen incommunicado within the United States without access to a lawyer and without being charged with a crime. The case actually resulted in four different opinions with four different views on the President’s power to detain a U.S. citizen indefinitely and without trial, ranging from Justices Souter and Ginsburg, who found that the President does not have any authority to detain citizens as enemy combatants because such detentions had not been congressionally authorized, to Justice Thomas, who would defer entirely to the executive branch.
Which of the four opinions in Hamdi, a case that has already been decided, would you say best approximates your views on the Executive power to designate enemy combatants: the prevailing opinion, the Souter-Ginsburg opinion, the Scalia-Stevens dissent, or the Thomas dissent?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, that does get into the area of asking me to comment on which opinions I think are correct that I don’t feel it’s appropriate for me to go. I do know that the approach
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00254 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

243
in this area is the approach set forth by Justice Jackson in his concurring opinion in the Youngstown case. That has set the framework for consideration of questions of Executive power in times of war and with respect to foreign affairs since it was decided.
And as you know, the issue in those cases and in many of the cases in the Supreme Court is whether Congress has endorsed the Executive action, in which case the President has his powers and the powers of Congress; whether Congress has prohibited the Executive action, in which case all he has is whatever residual authority he has less the power of Congress; or what often happens, that vast middle area where it’s impossible to tell or there’s argument about whether Congress has approved the action or not.
The Dames and Moore case that was decided in 1981 is an example of that, when to resolve the Iranian hostage crisis the President abrogated claims and relegated those with claims to the Iranian Claims Tribunal. The issue there, the Court looked back at a variety of congressional enactments going way back to the Civil War to try to determine if this type of exercise of authority is something Congress endorsed or opposed.
Senator FEINGOLD. But with regard to these opinions, and I understand you are hesitant to comment on a particular opinion or the nature of the reasoning, but which of the approaches in terms of the actual finding of the opinion, do you find closest to your view?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, I don’t remember which of those opinions follows the Youngstown analysis the most closely. My understanding of the appropriate approach in this area is that it is the Youngstown analysis, the one set forth in Justice Jackson’s concurring opinion, and I think that is the most appropriate way to flesh out the issues. You do need to understand, because this is an area in which judges need to understand, there is often conflict between the branches and you do need to at least set the table correctly to understand, is the President acting with congressional support, against it, or do we have to try to determine which of those areas it is? And I think you do need to lay that analysis out before deciding the case.
Senator FEINGOLD. Last month when I was home in Wisconsin, a constituent came up and said to me that he believed the D.C. Circuit decision in the Hamdan case, a different case, which you joined in, to uphold the Government’s ability to try a Guantanamo Bay detainee by military commission, should disqualify you from being on the Supreme Court. This is apart from the issue that Senator Schumer and I wrote you about, which I will turn to later.
I want to know, with regard to the substance of the decision, why do you think someone would think that your decision in that case— why would somebody come up to me and say that your decision in that case should disqualify you from consideration as a Supreme Court Justice?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, you’ve touched upon an area in which I cannot comment under the—that case is still pending. It’s pending before the Supreme Court. Under the Judicial Canons of Ethics, Canon 3–A(6), I’m not supposed to comment publicly in any way about a case that’s still pending.

244
Senator FEINGOLD. I’m not asking you to comment on the case. I am asking you why you think somebody who I represent would care enough about this issue that they would say this should be a disqualifier—in other words, characterize what is the issue in the case that would make somebody that concerned that they would make such a statement?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the issue involves the same sort of issues that you began the discussion with, the question of civil liberties in wartime, and certainly I understand people having strong views on that particular question. But whether the decision on the merits was correctly resolved or not, or anything about it, I’m just absolutely prohibited from talking about it by those judicial canons. There’s even an advisory opinion that explains that that canon applies to a Senate confirmation hearing. So my ethical obligation not to comment publicly on a case that’s still pending prevents me from saying anything more.
Senator FEINGOLD. Of course, I respect your judgment on these matters, but I believe that it’s important that the nominee indicate a sense of why people in this country might have some anxiety on this point.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, certainly— Senator FEINGOLD. The difficult events that have occurred since September 11th create a climate sometimes of fear, in particular, fear of Government power, that I think it is important not only for Members of Congress but even members of the Supreme Court to help minimize, and I am just trying to get a sense if you feel that concern in the Nation. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I certainly don’t minimize the significance of a decision by a court of appeals or by the Supreme Court about the scope of Executive authority in this area, about its impact on individual liberties, about the issues of separation of powers and whether the relation between the Congress and the Executive— whether the Executive is acting with congressional endorsement and support or in the face of congressional opposition. Those, of course, are very sensitive issues and always have been throughout our history. I certainly appreciate that. Those are significant matters. It’s just that I’m prohibited from talking about the substance of the case. Senator FEINGOLD. Let me talk to an aspect of the case that I think you can speak to. Many people were surprised to learn in your questionnaire submitted to the Committee that you were interviewed by the Attorney General in connection with a possible vacancy on the Supreme Court on April 1st of this year, just 6 days before you sat on the panel that heard oral arguments in the Hamdan case, and that while the case was still pending, before a decision was issued, you had additional interviews in May with the Vice President, the White House Counsel, Mr. Karl Rove, and other top officials. I am going to give you an opportunity to explain why you think it was not necessary for you to recuse yourself from the case, but first I would like to know: Did the possibility of recusal because you were under serious consideration for the Supreme Court occur to you, or was it raised with you at any point prior to the oral argument in the case?

245
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, that, again, is a question I can’t answer for you. I can’t address that. There’s a motion pending in the Court seeking to file a petition to recuse, and that motion is pending. It’s a matter I can’t talk about outside of the judicial process.
In addition, because the Hamdan case itself is still pending, I don’t think that’s appropriate for me to address that.
Senator FEINGOLD. Judge, I am a little disappointed with that answer. As you know, Senator Schumer and I sent you a letter asking questions about this issue, and then we received a letter on September 1 from the Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs at the Department of Justice on your behalf. It says, ‘‘Your August 24th letter requests that Judge Roberts answer certain questions regarding the D.C. Circuit’s recent decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. As you know, Chairman Specter has scheduled hearings on Judge Roberts’s nomination to begin immediately after Labor Day. At that time, Judge Roberts will be available to respond to questions from all Senators on the Committee.’’
Now, I took that to mean a little more than telling me you couldn’t talk about it. Are you now refusing to answer a question even about when this issue—
Judge ROBERTS. Senator— Senator FEINGOLD.—came to your attention? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, we’re talking about the canons of judicial ethics. They’re quite clear on the subject. They say I may not talk about a matter that’s pending before the Court. Senator FEINGOLD. Even when it first came to your attention? Judge ROBERTS. That matter is still—is pending before the Court. My hands are tied. It’s not something I can discuss under the canons of ethics. Senator FEINGOLD. I guess I will have to move on. Let’s go to voting rights. I want to follow up to Senator Kennedy’s questions about the Voting Rights Act and, in particular, about your opposition to amendments to the Act in 1982 when you were an adviser to the Attorney General in the Reagan Administration’s Justice Department. In 1982, Congress voted overwhelmingly to amend Section 2 to reinstate the test for vote dilution that many lower courts had used prior to the City of Mobile case, one that looked, as we talked about earlier, at the effects of an electoral scheme on the ability of minorities to elect candidates of their choice rather than on the intent behind this scheme. While you were in the Reagan Justice Department, you seemed to have done almost everything in your power to thwart that congressional effort. Your view was that the intent test should stand. This was the policy position of the Justice Department, as you have indicated, and you wholeheartedly supported it at the time. Your memos make that very clear. In one memo, you lamented that the House bill then under consideration would make it much easier to attack ‘‘such widely accepted practices as at-large voting.’’ Now, those practices, of course, were among the most commonly used systems to prevent the election of any minorities to local government bodies. We know that the effects test put into place in the 1982 amendments to the Vot-

ing Rights Act has been very successful in improving minority representation in Congress and at all levels of Government.
Do you believe today that those gains have been good for the country?
Judge ROBERTS. I think the gains under the Voting Rights Act have been very beneficial in promoting the right to vote, which is preservative of all other rights. The issue about how to extend the Voting Rights Act, again, my position was a member of the staff in the Justice Department. The administration position of extending the Voting Rights Act for the longest period in history, as is, without change, was in no sense reflective of any disagreement with the proposition that the Voting Rights Act was extremely valuable in securing not just the right to vote but all other rights—
Senator FEINGOLD. Well, what I am trying to get at here, Judge, obviously, is this distinction between effects and intent. Let’s follow up on the fact that you said that these gains have been good for the country. Do you believe that these gains we have seen in minority representation would have occurred if your view supporting the intent approach had prevailed in 1982?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think some of them would have. I don’t know if all of them would have. It’s obviously impossible to tell, to go back and determine whether a particular application of a different approach would have had the same results or different results. I think that’s very hard to tell.
Senator FEINGOLD. Do you still believe that the intent test was the more appropriate standard by which to evaluate vote dilution claims?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, my personal view of the Voting Rights Act was not something somebody was interested in. You have people who serve on your staff, and their job is to help you implement your views as a Senator. I am just—
Senator FEINGOLD. I am not questioning what your view was then. I am asking what you think now having—and this is pretty settled area, I think you would agree—having seen all this, having been intimately involved in it, knowing it as well as you do. Do you believe that the intent test is still the more appropriate standard by which to evaluate vote dilution claims?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I haven’t studied the Voting Rights Act to determine whether the intent test or the effects test would have different results in different cases under Section 2. I’m in no position to make a judgment on that.
Senator FEINGOLD. It would be my sense that you would be a person who would—with your enormous abilities and background— to have some sense about that. Obviously, you understand that requiring a voter to prove any additional factor makes it harder for the voter to win the case and that to prove the intent of an entire legislative body can be very difficult, especially when a voting system was put in place many years ago. Requiring African-Americans and Latino voters, many of whom have had limited financial resources, to find evidence of intent was adding an enormous hurdle for them to overcome. And the Mobile v. Bolden case itself, which was pursued after the Supreme Court’s decision in 1980 and before Congress amended the law in 1982, makes it very clear, I think clear to all of us over the years, how difficult that standard was.

African-Americans from Mobile, Alabama, have been unable to elect any candidates to the position of city commissioner for every election cycle for something like seven decades. They challenged the method of electing city commissioners that allowed the same majority to choose all the commissioners all the time in at-large elections. And the evidence was very clear that, as a practical matter, although African-Americans could register and vote, they couldn’t elect anyone. But to get relief under the Supreme Court standard which you appear to have supported, they had to go to enormous effort and financial expense to prove discriminatory intent, including hiring a historian who could piece together the motivations of city officials who had designed the electoral system almost a hundred years earlier.
In this situation, the administration was not bound by a Supreme Court decision in deciding what position to take under the proposed Voting Rights Act amendments. So why at that point did you want to make Section 2 cases so difficult to prove?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, you keep referring to what I supported and what I wanted to do. I was a 26-year-old staff lawyer. It was my first job as a lawyer after my clerkships. I was not shaping administration policy. The administration policy was shaped by the Attorney General on whose staff I served. It was the policy of President Reagan. It was to extend the Voting Rights Act without change for the longest period in history at that point, and it was my job to promote the Attorney General’s view and the President’s view on that issue. And that’s what I was doing.
Senator FEINGOLD. I recognize that. What I am trying to figure out is given the fact that you have followed this issue for such a long time, I would think you would have a view at this point about whether you were right about—or the Department, let’s say, since you were working for them, whether the Department was right on seeking to keep the intent test or whether time has shown that the effects tests is really the more appropriate test.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I haven’t followed the issue or the particular litigation. I had involvement in some litigation when I was in the Solicitor General’s office, in which we were effective in proving violations under the Voting Rights Act. Many of those cases arose under issues under Section 5, pre-clearance issues, and not under Section 2.
I as a judge had a case, a three-judge district court case, again, arising under the pre-clearance provisions, but I’m certainly not an expert in the area and haven’t followed and have no way of evaluating the relative effectiveness of the law as amended or the last as it was prior to 1982.
Senator FEINGOLD. Well, with all respect, I realize I should move on to another topic, but it just seems given how strongly you stated some of these memos—and I understand you were doing your job— I would think you would have a view today whether or not those strong statements still make sense. But let me move on.
As you know, 42 U.S.C. 1983 is a Federal law that allows Americans to sue those who deprive them of their rights under the Constitution or Federal statutes. Section 1983 is a very important law because it has enabled individuals who are deprived of their rights to such things as Medicaid, public housing, child support enforce-

248
ment, and public assistance to enforce those rights in Federal court. And I am a little concerned that you seem to have consistently argued for making it harder to bring Section 1983 lawsuits. In briefs you have filed, you advanced a series of arguments to effectively reverse decades of Supreme Court decisions and restrict Americans’ ability to enforce Federal statutory rights under Section 1983.
As Deputy Solicitor General, you co-authored an amicus brief and argued in front of the Supreme Court in a case called Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association. You said that individual Medicaid providers should not be able to sue under Section 1983 to enforce a provision of the Medicaid statute which requires States to reimburse them for services at reasonable rates. One of the arguments you made is that in order for a statutory right to be enforceable under Section 1983, the Court must find that the Congress clearly intended ‘‘to authorize private enforcement of that right in Federal court.’’ You repeated this argument in another case you later argued when you were in private practice, Gonzaga University v. Doe.
The Supreme Court rejected your arguments in Wilder and found that the Medicaid providers could sue. In the later Gonzaga case, the Supreme Court specifically rejected your argument and found that it was not necessary for plaintiffs in a Section 1983 case to show that Congress intended to create a private right of action to bring a lawsuit, and Section 1983 already supplies a cause of action.
What role did you play in deciding that the Government would participate as amicus in the Wilder case? And what role did you play in developing the argument that it made? And did you agree with the position that the Government took in the case?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’ll answer that question, but before I do so, the position I advanced in the Gonzaga case prevailed. The argument that we made on behalf of the university—I was obviously representing the university’s position, and they prevailed before the Supreme Court.
In the Wilder case, the determination to participate as an amicus was made by the Solicitor General, and I don’t recall a particular role in that case. I worked on the brief. I presented the argument. We lost that case 5–4. It was a close issue. All of these issues go to the question of what Congress intended to do. If Congress had spelled out whether or not a right should be enforceable in Court, that is what the determination would be in Court. These issues arise only because of confusion over whether or not Congress has spelled out that a right should be enforceable in Federal court for damages or not. And in the Wilder case, the Court determined 5– 4 that the right should be enforceable in Federal court. We were as an amicus supporting one of the States. I don’t remember which one it was. And the State was making the argument that there is— the right is—the issue in all of these cases is whether the right should be enforceable administratively as opposed to—
Senator FEINGOLD. Excuse me. I am just about to run out of time. Let me point out the Supreme Court did not accept the argument that the plaintiffs had to show that Congress intended to create a private right of action. And I am wondering now, do you now agree with the argument that you have consistently made, both as

a Government lawyer in Wilder and while in private practice in Gonzaga, that individuals should not be able to sue under Section 1983 to enforce a right unless the Supreme Court finds that Congress clearly intended to authorize private enforcement of that particular right in Federal court?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the Gonzaga decision, which resulted— there were various arguments made in the brief. The ruling of the Court was in favor of the university that I was representing. And the determination in the Gonzaga case about what should be shown and what has to be shown is one of the precedents of the Court that I would follow, as any other, consistent with rules of stare decisis. That’s not an area in which I have any particular view. I’ve argued both sides of that issue. On behalf of plaintiffs, I argued in favor of it, and on behalf of defendants, against it.
Again, the issue is not the enforceability, as in Gonzaga. The issue was should individuals be allowed to bring suit as opposed to action by, in that case, the Department of Education.
Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you for your answers, Judge Roberts. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feingold. Senator Graham? Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I imagine the reason that you argue different positions is because people paid you, is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. That’s how I made my living, Senator. Senator GRAHAM. I can relate to that. [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. I imagine it must be very hard to figure out what Congress intends. Do you agree with that? Judge ROBERTS. Sometimes it’s easier than others. Senator GRAHAM. Yes. Judge ROBERTS. And sometimes it’s hard to read the tea leaves. Senator GRAHAM. I can relate to that also. I want to read an excerpt from the National Association of Women Lawyers and their evaluation of you, 8–30–05. ‘‘As a lawyer and judge, based on interviews the Committee conducted, Judge Roberts has treated individual women lawyers fairly and with respect, has fostered careers of women lawyers, has been helpful in enabling women to address worklife balance issues while advancing professionally, and has been consistently described as respectful to female colleagues, female lawyers appearing before him, and female employees.’’ You have been asked about every case I think ever written by anyone. I would like to talk to you a little bit about life. The idea of judging you based on this section of the Commerce Clause and that section of the Commerce Clause is important, but I think most Americans want to know a little bit about you. From what I can tell, the people who have worked with you and against you generally like you, and that you have been described as brilliant, one of the best legal minds of your time, well-qualified, the adjectives go on and on, and I want the record to reflect that comes from people who know you the best. The best indication of a good lawyer is how people on the other side think of you, and we will get some excerpts from the record to put that into the record.

Apparently, from what I can tell, you conduct your life in a noble, honorable manner, that you have been a good litigant, and that you have fought for your causes, and you have done so to earn respect of those on both sides of the aisle.
But there is a greater issue here about who you are. Justice Rehnquist was your mentor; is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. He is certainly someone from whom I learned a great deal, yes.
Senator GRAHAM. So if I was trying to figure out who John Roberts is, and a little bit about him, I will ask this question. Write the legacy of Justice Rehnquist for a minute or two. What would you say if given that task?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, I think if you were able to ask him, he would talk about being a grandfather, being a father, being a husband.
Senator GRAHAM. I am asking you. Judge ROBERTS. But the important point is that those were important things in his life, and he appreciated the need to recognize that those are the most important things. With respect to the law, to which he devoted his professional life, I think a big part of the legacy that he leaves is a Supreme Court in which all of the members respected and admired him because of his fairness in administering the Court and conducting the important responsibilities like managing the Conference, and assigning opinions. You can go back in history and look at what other Chief Justices did. Some were, in terms of that administrative responsibility, some were disasters. You look at Harlan Stone. His idea of running the Conference, he said what he thought, then the next senior Justice said what he thought, then Justice Stone critiqued that. Then the next Justice, and then Justice Stone critiqued that. And the result was the conferences went on for days, and everybody ended up hating each other. Senator GRAHAM. So he ran a good ship. I think we all agree with that. And his colleagues respected him whether they disagreed with him or not. But the basic question is, when you write about the legacy of a Supreme Court Justice, you write more than about being a grandfather and more about running a tight ship, especially Chief Justice. Would you agree with the idea that from a conservative point of view, he was the gold standard? Judge ROBERTS. I think he was a very effective advocate on the bench for a view of the Constitution that is one of limited and separated powers— Senator GRAHAM. Do you share that view? Judge ROBERTS. I do. I think that the—now, I have to tell you that whether as a judge on the court of appeals, or if I am confirmed on the Supreme Court, I will certainly be my own man, and there are— Senator GRAHAM. No one is doubting that. No one is doubting that you will not try to be fair. But the big theme, 30,000-foot view of you, is that when you look at Judge Roberts, you are looking at someone in the mold of a Rehnquist. Is that a fair assessment? Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, I admire the late Chief Justice very much, but I will have to insist that I will be my own man,

and I hesitate to be put in anybody’s mold, and I would certainly approach the cases according to the judicial philosophy that I have developed over the years. In many respects it’s similar to his, in its recognition I think of the limited role that judges should have, and of sufficient and appropriate modesty and humility, a recognition that—
Senator GRAHAM. The idea of a dramatic departure under your watch from the Rehnquist era is probably not going to happen, is that true?
Judge ROBERTS. Given my view of the role of a judge, which focuses on the appropriate modesty and humility, the notion of dramatic departures is not one that I would hold out much hope for.
Senator GRAHAM. I know people do not like being labeled, put me in that category, but I am in a business where people label me all the time. But I ask for it, I run for office. But we do tend in our business of politics to try to label people, particularly when we are talking about judges. When the President introduced you to the United States, to the people of the United States, he said you were a strict constructionist. Do you know what he meant by that and why he chose to use those words?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’d hope what he meant by that is somebody who’s going to be faithful to the text of the Constitution, to the intent of those who drafted it, while appreciating that sometimes the phrases they used, they were drafting a Constitution for the ages to secure the blessings of liberty for their posterity, they were looking ahead, and so they often used phrases that they intended to have a—
Senator GRAHAM. Does that term make you feel uncomfortable? Judge ROBERTS. No. Senator GRAHAM. Now, from a 30,000-foot view of things, it seems to be that we are going to have a referendum on the Reagan era here, which I welcome. I sort of enjoyed it. He won 49 States. He did pretty good. You were a part of the Reagan era as a young lawyer. When I use the word, term, ‘‘Reagan revolution,’’ what does it mean to you? Judge ROBERTS. Well, it means to me generally a change in attitude. President Reagan always presented an optimistic view. He always told us that the best days of our country were ahead of us, and he reasserted basic fundamental truths in areas like foreign relations. We were going to stand up to the Soviet Union. We’re proud of our system of Government. That’s the right approach, not the Soviet approach. And people who have come of age after the Berlin Wall has fallen sometimes don’t understand what it meant at that time. Senator GRAHAM. When it comes to the law, what does the term ‘‘Reagan revolution’’ mean to you? Judge ROBERTS. I think it means a belief that we should interpret the Constitution according to its terms, that judges don’t shape policy, that judges interpret the law, and that legislators shape policy. The executive branch executes the law. Senator GRAHAM. Does it also mean that when you talk about affirmative action and you set up a quota system, that is not right? Judge ROBERTS. President Reagan’s policy was opposed to quotas, which were much more rigid at the time. People need to ap-

252
preciate, 24 years ago the idea of a quota was a rigid set aside. We now have the recent Supreme Court decisions talking about consideration of particular factors as one factor in an affirmative action program. President Reagan was in favor of affirmative action, and he was opposed to quotas.
Senator GRAHAM. When it comes to voting rights, as I understand—and we have talked a lot about it, and we probably know more than all of us ever dreamed we would know about the Voting Rights Act—the you were implementing a policy of President Reagan that wanted to pass the Voting Rights Act in its form that you received it; is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. The proposal was to extend it for the longest period in history without change.
Senator GRAHAM. And we have been through a long discourse about the effect and intent test. I think you have explained yourself very well, that the Supreme Court in the Mobile case said the intent test applies to Section 2; is that right?
Judge ROBERTS. Section 2. Senator GRAHAM. Politics took over after that, did it not? Because the effect test no longer—that is not the test. Is it not some compromise between Senator Kennedy and Senator Dole? Judge ROBERTS. There was a compromise in the test under Section 2, which is articulated in a paragraph describing what the criteria are and including a caution that this should not be read to promote proportional representation which was some of the concern that the Attorney General and President Reagan had. Senator GRAHAM. So between Dole, Senator Kennedy and President Reagan, a new test was called the ‘‘Totality of the Circumstances?’’ Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator GRAHAM. When you said that you—Senator Kennedy said something I thought was very important, that courts should not stand in the way of elected officials who are trying to right wrongs. The point I am trying to make here is that you were picked by a conservative President because you have associated yourself with conservative administrations in the past, advising conservative Presidents about conservative policies. And there is another selection to be made, and you are going to get the same type person. You can—I am not even talking to you now. [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. To expect anything else, is just unfair. I do not expect, I did not expect President Clinton to pick you, not because you are not well-qualified, not because you are a good person, just a different political, legal philosophy. That is what we are going to have to come to grips with here. Justice Scalia—do you consider him conservative? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator GRAHAM. Do you think you are more conservative than he is? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t know. I mean I wouldn’t— Senator GRAHAM. He got 98 votes. I think you are conservative, but I think you are one of the great minds of our generation, of our time, and I am dying to find out if you get any votes on the other side. Time will tell.

Let us talk about righting wrongs here. I think it stinks that somebody can burn the flag and that is called speech. What do you think about that?
Judge ROBERTS. Well— [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. We had the Flag Protection Act after the Supreme Court concluded that it was protected speech. Senator GRAHAM. Show me where the term ‘‘symbolic speech’’ is in the Constitution. Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s not, and— Senator GRAHAM. It is not. They just made it up, did they not? I think it stinks that a kid cannot go to school and say a prayer if he wants to voluntarily. What do you think about that? Judge ROBERTS. That’s something it’s probably inappropriate for me to comment on. Senator GRAHAM. What do you think Ronald Reagan thought about that? Judge ROBERTS. His view was that voluntary school prayer was appropriate. Senator GRAHAM. I think it is not right for elected officials to be unable to talk about or protect the unborn. What do you think about that? Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, Senator, these are issues that are likely to come before the Court, and I cannot comment on those particulars because— Senator GRAHAM. Why are judges more capable of protecting or talking about the unborn than elected officials? Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, those are issues that come before the Court on a regular basis in particular cases, and whether on my current court or the future court, I need to be able to approach those cases with an open mind and not on the basis of statements I make during a confirmation hearing. Senator GRAHAM. The point is that righting wrongs is a very subjective thing, and you will be asked to decide the fate of people, with individual needs and individual desires, based on particular fact patterns and legal briefs. I am confident you can do that, and that you will do that, and I do not think you need to make a bargain with me to right all the wrongs that I see in life to sit on the Supreme Court. What is it like to go through the nominating process in 2005 from a personal point of view? I have been watching television, channel flipping, and I see some awful things said about you. Have you seen those things? Judge ROBERTS. I have seen some things, yes. Senator GRAHAM. How does that make you feel? Judge ROBERTS. Well, some of the mischaracterizations, you know, you get annoyed at them. I don’t like them. Some of the things you see, you get pretty upset about. Senator GRAHAM. How does it make your family feel? Judge ROBERTS. They’re—I would say they get upset about some of the things, as well— Senator GRAHAM. But you know it is a free country and that is just the way it is, right?

Judge ROBERTS. It is and it’s an expression I’ve been using a lot lately. It is a free country and it’s a good thing that it is.
Senator GRAHAM. Let’s not talk about you now, but I would like you to comment to us, give us some advice here. We are always trying to advise the President through you. What is the long-term effect on the quality of candidates that we will be able to recruit for jobs like the Supreme Court if the current process continues and grows over time?
Judge ROBERTS. I think it is a very serious threat to the independence and integrity of the courts to politicize them. I think that is not a good development, to regard the courts as simply an extension of the political process. That’s not what they are.
I’ve been fortunate for the past 2 years to serve on a court in which all of the judges, and they come—in the D.C. Circuit, they come from very active careers and public life, sometimes very identified politically, but it’s a court where those judges put aside those ties and those views and become judges all focused on the same mission of vindicating the rule of law.
And if you look at the decisions on the D.C. Circuit, you’ll see that we are almost always unanimous. We almost always come out the same way. And to the extent there are disagreements, they don’t shape up along political lines. That is an ideal. But the more and more that the process becomes politicized, the less likely that that’s going to happen.
Senator GRAHAM. Another line of inquiry that’s been disturbing to me is that we talk about the clients you represent, whether it be the Ronald Reagan Administration or some private sector client, and we tend to hold that maybe unpopular position against the lawyer. There is more and more of that happening. We have had court of appeals nominees that were accused of being insensitive to the disabled population when they won their case nine-to-nothing in the Supreme Court defending a university from the idea that they were not covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
I really do worry that in the future, that if we up here start holding who you represent against you, that young lawyers in the future will pass on the hard cases. What are your thoughts about that?
Judge ROBERTS. You know, it’s a tradition of the American Bar that goes back before the founding of the country that lawyers are not identified with the positions of their clients. The most famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.
Our Founders thought that they were not being given their rights under the British system to which they were entitled, and by representing the British soldiers, he helped show that what they were about was defending the rule of law, not undermining it, and that principle, that you don’t identify the lawyer with the particular views of the client, or the views that the lawyer advances on behalf of the client, is critical to the fair administration of justice.
Senator GRAHAM. Do you believe it is being eroded?

Judge ROBERTS. I do think there is an unfortunate tendency to attack lawyers because of the positions they press on behalf of clients and I think that’s unfortunate.
Senator GRAHAM. I am going to give you some examples of a sitting Supreme Court Justice and her positions and basically take us back to the good old days where you could have what I think are extreme positions and still make it.
Are you familiar with the ACLU? Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator GRAHAM. In the conservative world, how does that rank on the food chain? [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I don’t know that I could comment on that, but it’s—they have a consistent position of promoting civil liberties and a particular view on that. Senator GRAHAM. If you came to the Reagan administration and the top thing on your resume was the General Counsel for the ACLU, do you think they would hire you? Judge ROBERTS. It might make it a little harder. [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. I think that is a good observation. Well, we have on the sitting Supreme Court now the former General Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, who is a very nice lady, extremely qualified. I don’t agree with her hardly at all, but a great lawyer. She has written that the age of consent for women should be 12, that all prisons, to have gender equality, men and women should be in the same prison because when you separate them, women prisoners somehow are discriminated against. She wanted to do away, or argued the idea that Mother’s and Father’s Day should be done away with because it stereotypes men and women, that there is a constitutional right to prostitution. I can give you, and I will introduce into the record, writings from her point of view that most conservatives would find totally unacceptable. But this person, this lady, the former ACLU Executive Counsel, is sitting on the Supreme Court and she got 96 votes. She said that there should be Federal funding for abortion. Ninety percent of our caucus is pro-life, is that about right? Pretty close? I can assure you that if a Republican was going to make their vote based on abortion thinking, she would have gotten no votes. Most Americans don’t want Federal funding of abortion even though they are divided on the issue of a woman’s right to choose. She has argued that the Equal Protection Clause guarantees a right to abortion. Now, I completely differ with that, and I am sure the conservatives in the Senate at the time of her confirmation completely differed with that, the idea that the age of consent should be 12, that bigamy statutes are discriminatory to women. I can go on and on and on. The point I am trying to make is that all of that was put aside, who she represented and what she believed and the positions she took, and somehow back then they were able to see in Justice Ginsburg a well-qualified, brilliant legal mind, and they deferred to President Clinton because he won the election. Whether that happens to you, I don’t know, but for the sake of the country and the

rule of law, I hope it does. I hope you can be in the ballpark of where she wound up.
My last two questions. In your opening statement, you articulated the rule of law in a way that I thought was just outstanding. It was emotional. It made sense. Average people could understand it, that the courtroom is a quiet place, Judge Roberts, where you park your political ideology and you call the balls and you call the strikes and you try to give every American a fair shake and you put politics in its perspective.
What is your biggest concern, if any, about the rule of law as it exists in America, and what are the biggest threats to the rule of law as we know it today?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, the rule of law is always vulnerable because the Supreme Court, as has been pointed out often in history, has only the persuasive power of its opinions to command respect. There have been famous episodes in the past, you know, President Jackson, Chief Justice Marshall has given his opinion, let’s see him enforce it, other episodes of that sort. But over time, the legitimacy of the Supreme Court has been established and it’s generally recognized across the political spectrum that it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is and that the other branches have the obligation to obey what the Supreme Court says the law is.
The one threat, I think, to the rule of law is a tendency on behalf of some judges to take that legitimacy and that authority and extend it into areas where they’re going beyond the interpretation of the Constitution, where they’re making the law. And because it’s the Supreme Court, people are going to follow it even though they’re making the law. The judges have to recognize that their role is a limited one. That is the basis of their legitimacy.
I have said it before and I will just repeat myself. The Framers were not the sort of people, having fought a revolution to get the right of self-government, to sit down and say, let’s take all the difficult issues before us and let’s have the judges decide them. That would have been the farthest thing from their mind. The judges had the obligation to decide cases and the authority to interpret the Constitution because they had to decide cases and they were going to decide those cases according to the law, not according to their personal preferences.
Judges have to have the courage to make the unpopular decisions when they have to. That sometimes involves striking down Acts of Congress. That sometimes involves ruling that acts of the Executive are unconstitutional. That is a requirement of the judicial oath. You have to have that courage. But you also have to have the self-restraint to recognize that your role is limited to interpreting the law and doesn’t include making the law.
Senator GRAHAM. What would you like history to say about you when it is all said and done?
Judge ROBERTS. I’d like them to start by saying he was confirmed.
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Whether they say that or not, I would like it— the answer is the same. I would like them to say I was a good judge.

Senator GRAHAM. Thank you very much. I have no further questions.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Graham. Senator Schumer? Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Judge. It has been a long day, and I guess we have a little bit longer to go. But you have been talking something about baseball. We have been talking about it this morning. I will start out by pitching you something of a softball, an issue, I think, on which reasonable Americans can agree, and those are the recent and abhorrent attacks on the Federal judiciary. Many Americans have become concerned that the judiciary has come under escalating and, many would say, inappropriate and unjustified criticism from certain quarters, not just criticism of the legal reasoning, it goes way beyond that. The rhetoric gets pretty hot. And as you know, one of your mentors and our late Chief Justice Rehnquist was a passionate defender of the independence of the judiciary. I did not agree with him on a whole lot of things, but I sure respected that. And he did a good job, both with our Committee and everywhere else, making sure that the independence of the judiciary was defended. So you will be Chief Justice. We have not talked much here about your role as Chief Justice. The Chief is the leader of the courts, the head of the judiciary, and I think one of your important roles is to defend the independence of the judiciary. So I am going to read you a few statements that were made about Federal judges in recent months. Televangelist Pat Robertson has claimed that ‘‘an out-of-control judiciary is the single greatest threat to democracy,’’ that judges are creating a ‘‘tyranny of oligarchy,’’ and that the threat posed by the Federal judiciary is ‘‘probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings.’’ Do you find that—do you disagree with that statement? Judge ROBERTS. I do disagree with that conclusion, Senator. I think it’s perfectly appropriate for people to criticize decisions of judges. That comes with the territory. It’s a healthy thing. That type of criticism and analysis, saying the judge got it wrong, the court got it wrong, is healthy and good. And the only thing I would say is I’m not sure whether that criticism is along that line or— but personal attacks on judges for doing their best to live up to the judicial oath, that is something that I don’t think is appropriate. Senator SCHUMER. Well, isn’t this language—I am asking about this language. This does not seem to be a legal didaction about a court case. When somebody says— Judge ROBERTS. Oh, it’s not an analysis— Senator SCHUMER.—judges are probably more serious—the threat posed by Federal judges is ‘‘probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into buildings,’’ isn’t that kind of quote abhorrent and inimical to our system? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t agree with that, and all I’m saying is that I think people have a right to be critical of judges, but attacks on judicial independence are not appropriate because judges—and certainly even judges with whom I disagree on the results or particular merits, they should not be attacked for their decisions. The

258
decisions can be criticized, but attacking the judges I think is not appropriate.
Senator SCHUMER. Would you be a little stronger than that in terms of language like this? I mean, ‘‘not appropriate’’ is kind of mild in these kinds of inflammatory statements about the judiciary that you may soon be entrusted with protecting.
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I said yesterday that, if confirmed, I would be vigilant to protect the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court and the judicial branch, and that is true. An independent judiciary is one of the keys to safeguarding the rule of law. Again, I said that yesterday, and I believe that. And to the extent the judiciary is attacked, I will be vigilant to respond and defend it.
Senator SCHUMER. Let me read you two more and just tell me how you would characterize them. Conservative lawyer and author Edwin Vieira suggested that Justice Kennedy, an appointee of Ronald Reagan, ought to be impeached for his decisions and quoted Stalin’s infamous problem-solving solution of ‘‘no man, no problem.’’ And Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council said, ‘‘The Court has become increasingly hostile to Christianity, and it poses a greater threat to representative government more than anything, more than budget deficits, more than terrorist groups.’’
Do you strongly disagree? Don’t those statements turn your insides a little bit?
Judge ROBERTS. You know, again, I don’t agree with them, but it’s a free country. They’re free to say what they wish. But the issue of impeachment was resolved in the Salmon Chase hearings. The basic principle was established. You don’t impeach judges if you disagree with their decisions. That’s not what the impeachment provision is.
Senator SCHUMER. I take it—and just answer. If you became Chief Justice, you would do whatever you could to dispel these kinds of notions and oppose people who said things like this when they say these things?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I would do what I can, Senator, to make it clear to people—and I do think it’s an important educating function that what judges do promotes the rule of law and that the rule of law preserves liberties for all Americans. I’m obviously not going to infringe anybody’s First Amendment rights. People are free to say what they—
Senator SCHUMER. I am not asking that. I am asking just your First Amendment opinion of these kinds of things, and the most I guess you said is you disagree.
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, people from all across the political spectrum have attacked judges. They do it now. I’ve seen some very virulent attacks from all over the political spectrum, and certainly throughout history. Again, judges can stand the criticism of their opinions, but personal attacks I think are beyond the pale.
Senator SCHUMER. Okay. I would like to go over some other things here. I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by some of your answers today. As you know from our private meetings and my opening statement yesterday, my principal concern is ensuring that we do not have people on our Court who will dismantle the structural protections that have guaranteed our most fundamental

259
constitutional rights. And what troubles me and why I think many people are bothered by this right now is that the President has openly stated that nominees will be chosen in the mold of Justices who have stated repeatedly their desire to roll back the clock on some of these basic protections.
In my view, over the past 60 or 70 years, maybe longer, three legs have sustained our constitutional rights: the 14th Amendment’s guarantees of equal protection and substantive due process, the right to privacy, and a broad delegation of authority to Congress to pass legislation, usually under the Commerce Clause, necessary to protect our Nation’s security, the environment, Americans’ health, and workers’ civil rights.
On these first two, you have given answers that I think show that you want to protect those rights, and I just want to repeat them and just make sure that you are on the record for them. To Senator Biden, he asked, ‘‘Do you agree there is a right to privacy to be found in the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment?’’ And you responded, ‘‘I do, Senator. Liberty is not limited to freedom from physical restraint. It does cover areas, as you said, such as privacy, and it’s not protected only in procedural terms, but it’s protected substantively as well.’’ That accurately states your view.
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. And on the Griswold case and the right to privacy there, you said in reference to Senator Kohl’s question, ‘‘I agree with the Griswold Court’s conclusion that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that. The Court since Griswold has grounded the privacy right discussed in that case in the liberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause.’’ That is your accurate view. Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Just one question. I know this could take the rest of our time, but if you could answer it succinctly, just tell me how—I am interested in how you will divine what that right to privacy means. I mean, this is going to be an issue in the 21st century that is before us in many, many different ways, and there are no words in the Constitution. Judge ROBERTS. Well, the Court, for example, I think most recently in the Glucksberg case, talked about the necessity of considering our Nation’s history, traditions, and practices. As Justice Harlan always explained in his opinions, you need to do that with an appropriate sensitivity to the limitations on the judicial role. Again, you need to recognize that it is not your job to make policy, either under the Constitution or under the statutes. You are interpreting the Constitution. And the appropriate judicial role focuses on those considerations, tradition and history and practice, as developed in the Court’s precedents. And that’s where I would start. In any case where the issue came up as to whether or not a particular issue was presented under the Due Process Clause, you begin with the precedents. You analyze them under principles of stare decisis, the precedents in this area, just like precedents in any other area, and analyze them in light of those different factors. All the Justices recognize that in this area they are—you need to be especially careful about the source of the content that you’re giving to the right at issue, because it is an area in which the dan-

260
ger of judges going beyond their appropriately limited authority is presented because of the nature of the sources of authority. You’re not construing the text narrowly. You’re not looking at a particular statute with legislative history.
All of the Justices recognize that it presents particular challenges.
Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Thank you. Now, as I said, there are a few things that I think many of us were pleasantly surprised about. There are some that we are troubled about. I think you have answered some questions, but not answered a whole lot of others. And I am going to get into that at another point. But I do find it very perplexing—and I am not going to ask you to comment on this—your use of the so-called Ginsburg precedent. It seems you cite it when you don’t want to answer something, but a few times here, when Ginsburg had actually answered those specific questions, you didn’t want to answer them, and you ignored the precedent. And I don’t think that is what precedents are, even in this more unique role. So I hope you will think about that overnight because I will get back to that tomorrow. The other thing that has troubled me is the issue of civil rights. Many of us consider racism the Nation’s poison. De Toqueville wrote about that in 1832. And we know you wrote these series of memos 20 to 25 years ago. Some of them are written in a tone that suggests you may have been insensitive to discrimination and hostile to equal rights. And I have talked to people who might have felt just that. People have said that. So my question is not the substance, but do you regret the tone of some of these memos? Do you regret some of the inartful phrases you used in those memos or reference to ‘‘illegal amigos’’ in one memo? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, in that particular memo, for example, it was a play on the standard practice of many politicians, including President Reagan, when he was talking to a Hispanic audience, he would throw in some language in Spanish. Again, the memos were from me to Fred Fielding. I think Mr. Fielding always found the tone— Senator SCHUMER. You don’t regret using that term? Could you think that some people might find it offensive? Judge ROBERTS. It was meant to convey the notion—again, as I’ve described—that when politicians speak to a particular audience in that language, is that offensive to the audience? It was meant to convey that. It was an issue concerning a particular radio interview. You know, the tone was, I think, generally appropriate for a memo from me to Mr. Fielding, and I know that he never suggested that it was anything other than appropriate. Senator SCHUMER. I would have to disagree with you, but we will leave it at that. On a more substantive level, in light of where we are in 2005— admittedly we have progressed in civil rights since 1982—can you identify any policy or piece of legislation you argued for or supported in the Reagan era that you now believe went too far, that you now believe would not be good enough for America? I am not

challenging that you were representing somebody else than, as you have said to us before, but I am asking in hindsight—it is now 2005, you are almost double the years on this Earth. Any of those policies that you think now, using hindsight, shouldn’t have been done?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I think some 80,000 pages have been released of memoranda that I wrote—
Senator SCHUMER. You can just pick one or two. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t—you know, I have not gone back and re-evaluated all those policies, no. I do know, though, for example, in the area of civil rights, people have talked about memos I wrote about the administration’s policy against busing or the administration’s policy against quotas. Being against busing and being against quotas is not the same as being against civil rights. President Reagan was against busing. President Reagan was against quotas. But he was in favor of civil rights, and that was the administration position that I was advancing in those memoranda. Senator SCHUMER. I understand you were advancing someone else’s position. I was asking your own view, if there were any regrets or changes in viewpoint of you personally. But we will leave it at that if you don’t want to mention any. Okay. I would like to go to the third leg of protection now and probably spend the rest of my time on this, constitutional rights, the Commerce Clause. Now, just to briefly encapsulate—you have said this—you agree that the Constitution gives the Supreme Court the power to review and invalidate Acts of Congress as was held two centuries ago in Marbury v. Madison. Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. And you also said in questions, I guess, with Senator Kennedy that you agree with the Court’s conclusion that segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race was unconstitutional, as in Brown. There is a third case that I would like to bring up, and it is the third leg of the framework in a lot of ways, and that is Wickard v. Filburn. Do you agree with the principle that the Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate activities that are purely local so long as Congress finds that the activities ‘‘exert a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce? ’’ In other words, can Congress regulate commerce that does not involve an article traveling across State lines? Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s obviously the Court’s holding in Wickard v. Filburn, and reaffirmed recently to a large extent in the Raich case. But I would say that because it has come up again so recently in the Raich case that it’s an area where I think it’s inappropriate for me to comment on my personal view about whether it’s correct or not. That’s unlike an issue under Marbury v. Madison or Brown v. Board of Education, which I don’t think is likely to come up again before the Court. This was just before the Court last year, and so I should, I think, avoid commenting on whether I think it’s correct or not. Senator SCHUMER. This is not a recent case. This is Wickard v. Filburn. It is from 1942, I guess it was. It is a basic bedrock of our constitutional law, law after law, the civil rights laws of 1982 and

262
1965 and 1964 that you talked about previously, are based on the Commerce Clause, not necessarily on Wickard.
Judge ROBERTS. No, not on Wickard. Senator SCHUMER. And I understand that, but so much of what we do is based on the Commerce Clause, and you know that there is a movement to greatly cut back on the Commerce Clause, led by Professor Epstein. One of the Justices that the President said he wanted to appoint more Justices like, Justice Thomas, doesn’t really believe in the holding of Wickard. And at a time with Hurricane Katrina, in the midst of the war on terror, where we need a strong national Government, I find it— I am not asking you—there has been a holding that has been accepted, and it was accepted in Raich, as well, but just about everybody with a few exceptions I mentioned that says you don’t need the article to cross State lines to be regulatable under the Commerce Clause by the Federal Government. That seems to me to be as little in dispute as Griswold, as Brown, in terms of its broad acceptance, in terms of a term that you have used, in terms of the stability of our Government. I am really surprised that you are unwilling to simply say—I am not asking you for all the variations on the theme, but a fundamental bedrock, which is that Congress can regulate under the Commerce Clause things that don’t cross State lines is something that is in some doubt. Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator— Senator SCHUMER. You know, you said that—excuse me. You said that there would be unanimity, just about, or close to it, on issue after issue. Obviously, there are dissents. I think Learned Hand in 1958 said he didn’t agree with Marbury, but you said you had no problems going along with Marbury. In Brown, I suppose there are still some people who don’t believe in Brown here and there. And here is a bedrock principle, admittedly under attack by what I would call an extreme few, that if we didn’t unequivocally back it, not the variations on the theme but the fundamental, the fundamental principle that Congress can regulate if the article doesn’t actually cross, the Congress can regulate manufacturing because of its dramatic effect on interstate commerce. And you are unwilling to give Wickard the same status that you give Griswold, which was decided 22 years later, or Brown, which was decided 12 years later. I mean, I know about Morrison and Lopez, but they don’t challenge the fundamental precept. I didn’t ask you if you fully support Wickard. I asked you if you support the proposition that under the Commerce Clause, you don’t need the actual article crossing the State line, and you are not willing to say that is settled law, that that is a part of our established way of law? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, all you have to do is look at the arguments, the briefs in the Raich case where that was the issue that was argued, whether or not Wickard v. Filburn was still good law, whether or not Wickard v. Filburn should be applied in that situation. Nobody in recent years has been arguing whether Marbury v. Madison is good law. Nobody has been arguing whether Brown v.

263
Board of Education was good law. They have been arguing whether Wickard v. Filburn is good law. Now, it was reaffirmed in the Raich case and that is a precedent of the Court, just like Wickard, that I would apply like any other precedent. I have no agenda to overturn it. I have no agenda to revisit it. It’s a precedent of the Court.
But I do think it’s a bit much to say it’s on the same plane as a precedent as Marbury v. Madison and Brown v. Board of Education—
Senator SCHUMER. Or Griswold? Judge ROBERTS. Or Griswold. The fact that it was just reconsidered and reargued last year in the Raich case suggests that it’s not that same type of case, and that’s why I’m uncomfortable commenting on it. I have gone farther than many other nominees in talking about cases like Marbury, like Brown, like Griswold, because I thought it was appropriate given the fact that those issues are not, in my view, likely to come before the Court again. Here’s an issue that was just before the Court last year, so I can’t say that it’s unlikely to come before the Court again and, therefore, I think it falls in the category of cases in which I should tell you I recognize it as a precedent of the Court. I have no agenda to overturn it or revisit it. But beyond that, I think it’s inappropriate to comment. Senator SCHUMER. Well, I would say that—well, let us go to a few more Commerce Clause issues. Again, I think Wickard is as accepted, is as part—not Wickard per se, but the idea that crossing State lines is not the only thing that you need for the Commerce Clause, that you don’t have to have the article cross State lines to be able to regulate it is a bedrock of law after law after law that the Federal Government has passed. Your inability to concede that— Judge ROBERTS. And I’m not expressing— Senator SCHUMER. I understand, but— Judge ROBERTS. I’m not expressing any hostility to the proposition at all. All I’m telling you is that this is a case that was challenged, the application, in the Raich case last year. And to say that it’s in the same category as Marbury or Brown, I think is inaccurate. Senator SCHUMER. But sir, Griswold came up in Lawrence. I don’t known how many years ago that was. You can make the argument that even, somehow or other, somebody challenged precepts that flow from Marbury. I certainly— Judge ROBERTS. And so perhaps I should have taken the approach Justice Scalia took. He wouldn’t tell this Committee whether Marbury was correctly decided. Senator SCHUMER. I am glad you didn’t do that. Judge ROBERTS. Well, and then the reward for not doing that is to have additional cases that are very current in terms of the litigation before the Court, and the idea, as well, you said what you thought about Marbury. What do you think about the Raich case, which just reaffirmed Wickard v. Filburn? There are two very different parameters. My approach has been a practical one, not an ideological one, but a practical one, but saying—

264
Senator SCHUMER. I am sorry. Just explain to me why you can say it about Griswold, which I am glad you did, but not about Wickard. Both of them have been litigated, tangentially, at least, in the last five or six years.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Wickard was litigated directly in the Raich case. I don’t think the issue in Griswold is likely to come before the Court. It was unlikely—
Senator SCHUMER. Wasn’t Lawrence an outgrowth of Griswold in terms of what the right of privacy is to consenting adults in their bedroom?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s one of the issues, but the difference between the issue that was presented in Griswold and its ramifications of the analysis, those are two very different issues.
Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Let me ask you just a little bit about— a little more on the Commerce Clause. We have all talked about the hapless toad and the need—the fact that the toad didn’t cross State lines didn’t lead you to reject the Endangered Species Act under the Commerce Clause but to go seek another possibility. So let me give you a couple of hypotheticals.
Let us say we figured out that somebody could make botulism, or a lot of people could make botulism, a deadly, deadly poison— I think it is one of the seven poisons that the FBI looks for in terms of doing danger to us—that they could make it with materials completely within the State. There was no material that crossed State lines. It is a little bit like the toad. Would you think that the Federal Government, if Congress ordained, would have the ability to regulate that activity?
Judge ROBERTS. I think that sounds a lot like the Raich case, where the Court determined the medical marijuana issue even though the regulation of marijuana as an illicit drug—it had interstate impact even if the medical provision of it did not, and so they were willing to look beyond and apply the Wickard case, which they reaffirmed the suitability, and conclude that that had a significant effect on commerce, the regulation in general. You didn’t have to look at the specific regulation.
It would seem to me that that— Senator SCHUMER. Would you different that from Viejo? Judge ROBERTS. Well, in Viejo, you’re dealing with particular species, and the difficulty—and again, it was what another court had looked at, not the activity that was regulated, the interference with the species, but the activity that was taking place and having that impact, the building of a housing development. Other courts, the Fifth Circuit in the GDF case, had argued that the approach of looking at the housing development rather than the particular activity was inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions, and what I said is that if there’s another basis on which to evaluate it, and there was, and the panel opinion noted, we don’t have to reach these other grounds because of our conclusion, that we should focus on those other alternative grounds and see if we could base and uphold the Act on those. Senator SCHUMER. I understand, and my time is getting close to the end, so—I’m not sure I agree with the large difference between Raich Viejo, and the hypothetical that I gave. I think the Viejo case

265
and the hypothetical I gave were limited, but let me just conclude with this.
You know, people wonder, what is all the fuss about? The answer is very simple, and that is that, if certain viewpoints became majority viewpoints on the Supreme Court, we could see the dismantling of the entire apparatus to protect our rights through the narrowing of the Commerce Clause, which I said Justice Thomas already agrees should be narrow, and we have a President who may have— he at least has one more nomination—who said he wants to appoint people in the mold of Thomas.
Not only would the Endangered Species Act go, Title VII would go. OSHA would be gone. The Controlled Substances Act and prohibitions against personal possessions of biological weapons could all be unconstitutional.
Justice Thomas’s views on this issue are similar to others. He is against any substantive due process right under the 14th Amendment. He believes that the Establishment Clause would allow the establishment of State religions—of religions in the States. And so this is a—these are serious, serious things. He would invalidate campaign finance laws. He would eliminate affirmative action.
Now, he is just one Justice, but I think it is our job here in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, if we feel that that kind of judicial philosophy, that kind of legal reasoning does not belong in the Court, to find out if nominees ascribe to it, and if they do, look at them warily.
I am not saying you do. As I said, some of the things you have said, I found pleasantly surprising today. But I do think it is our job and I think we are going to continue to do it.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Schumer. Senator Cornyn? Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, I appreciate your stamina. I particularly appreciate your responding to the call to public service and I want to say that I would be remiss if we didn’t express—if I didn’t express what I know all members of the Committee and the Senate feel is the appreciation for your family and their support— Chairman SPECTER. Senator Cornyn, before you proceed, there has been a request for a short break, so let us take one, 5 minutes. [Recess 6:43 p.m. to 6:52 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will resume. The clock has been reset at the full 30 minutes, Senator Cornyn. Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, let me start on a couple of items that I think will be relatively noncontroversial. Believe it or not—and maybe people watching this proceeding will not believe it—but members of this Committee and Members of the Senate actually do try to work together in a bipartisan basis to pass legislation that we believe is in the best interest of the people who sent us here and the American people. One area of bipartisan agreement, I just want to reiterate Senator Feingold’s comments about cameras in the courtroom. I am a strong supporter of cameras in the courtroom as long as they are unobtrusive and they do not disturb the proceedings or prejudice the rights of the litigants, but I do agree with him that it is impor-

tant. And Senator Grassley, I know is—each Congress introduces legislation on this. I do believe it is important to let the people of the United States know what happens in courtrooms. I think they could learn a lot about their Government. I think it would make them more sensitive to the nature of the decisions that are made there, give them confidence that there are dedicated public servants who serve in the judiciary, who are doing the job of a judge day in and day out in a dignified and distinguished and professional manner.
Along the lines of what Senator Kyl mentioned earlier, there is another area that I think is noncontroversial and bipartisan, but it is something, frankly, that we need your help with if you are confirmed as Chief Justice, and that has to do with the bar to the courtroom presented by excessive cost and time delays inherent in modern litigation. These impediments to access to justice are just as effective as if you had an armed guard at the door of the courthouse or had somebody put a padlock on the front door, because frankly, not many people can afford access to the courthouse, to justice, to jury trials because the costs are just so prohibitive. I remember that Chief Justice Burger, when he was Chief, took on the cause of alternative dispute resolution, and this cause of excessive delay and cost as being an impediment to access to justice with quite a bit of success.
But it is a cause that needs a lot of work. It needs the attention of the Chief Justice of the United States and the prestige that you would bring to that, because frankly, it worries me a great deal. Just like it concerns me that we see with the length of time of modern jury trials—of course when many people think about jury trials, they think about the O.J. Simpson trial where the jury was empaneled for months on end, and wonder how in the world can a jury still represent the conscience of the community and be a cross section of the community when so many people are precluded from serving because of the economic or other hardship associated with that. So these are hard issues that I hope you will take a look at and work with the Judiciary Committee and the Congress if necessary, or where necessary, I should say, to try to address, because I think that would be a great service to the American people.
As a good lawyer, you know the danger of analogies, and yesterday we started talking about judges as umpires. And you were quite eloquent in saying that you wanted to be an umpire, you did not want to bat or pitch, and I think it was a very succinct and appropriate way to describe exactly the role that you thought judges ought to play, not as partisans, but as impartial and disinterested in the outcome, but nevertheless, interested in providing access to justice.
I happened to be looking at my computer last night, one of the blogs, and it is always frightening to put your name in search and look at the ways it is mentioned. I suggest you do not do that, if you have not, until this hearing is over, because this hearing is the subject of a lot of activity and interest in the blogosphere. But one of these blogs said that your comparison of a judge to a baseball umpire reminded him of an old story about three different modes of judicial reasoning built on the same analogy.

First was the umpire that says, ‘‘Some are balls, and some are strikes, and I call them the way they are.’’ The second umpire says, ‘‘Some are balls and some are strikes, and I call them the way I see them.’’ The third said, ‘‘Some are balls and some are strikes, but they ain’t nothing till I call them.’’
Well, I do not know whether it is a fair question to ask you, which of those three types of umpires represents your preferred mode of judicial reasoning, but I wonder if you have any comment about that.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think I agree with your point about the danger of analogies in some situations. It’s not the last, because they are balls and strikes regardless, and if I call them one and they are the other, that doesn’t change what they are. It just means that I got it wrong. I guess I like the one in the middle because I do think there are right answers. I know that it’s fashionable in some places to suggest that there are no right answers and that the judges are motivated by a constellation of different considerations, and because of that it should affect how we approach certain other issues. That’s not the view of the law that I subscribe to.
I think when you folks legislate, you do have something in mind in particular, and you put it into words, and you expect judges not to put in their own preference, not to substitute their judgment for you, but to implement your view of what you are accomplishing in that statute.
I think when the Framers framed the Constitution it was the same thing, and the judges are not to put in their own personal views about what the Constitution should say, but they are supposed to interpret it and apply the meaning that is in the Constitution, and I think there is meaning there, and I think there is meaning in your legislation, and the job of a good judge is to do as good a job as possible to get the right answer.
Again, I know there are those theorists who think that is futile, or because it is hard in particular cases, we should just throw up our hands and not try in any case, and I do not subscribe to that. I believe that there are right answers, and judges, if they work hard enough, are likely to come up with them.
Senator CORNYN. Well, as a good lawyer you also know the danger of an analogy is that people will take it and run away with it, perhaps use it against you, and I heard today that yesterday we were talking about baseball, but today we are talking about dodge ball. Some have suggested that you have been less than forthcoming about your answers to the questions, and I just could not disagree with that more, and I want to go over this just a minute because I think it bears some repetition.
First of all, you were confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent just a little over 2 years ago to the District of Columbia court of appeals, what some have called the second most important or powerful court in the Nation. So you have been before the Committee before. You have been thoroughly investigated, examined and scrutinized, perhaps more than anyone else in history. The reason I say that is because since your nomination first as Associate Justice and now as Chief Justice, there have been more than 100,000 documents produced about your background and

record, some in the Government sector, some in the private sector. Of course, we have heard today how perhaps a line or a word or a choice of phrase can be used perhaps out of context to try to create an impression that may or may not be borne out by looking at the entire context of your record or even the document.
But I do believe you have been forthcoming. I know before we had the last two rounds of questions, you had answered 35 questions on civil rights, 10 on following precedents. You answered 40 questions about the role of a judge, 25 on abortion and privacy rights, and 11 on Presidential powers. So I would just disagree with the characterization that someone might make. I do not think it is fair or accurate that you have been anything less than completely forthcoming, and that we frankly know an awful lot about you. And that has not been a bad thing. I think from my point of view, the more that we have learned about you, the more confidence many of us have in the judgment of the President in your selection.
But of course, you are not there yet. We still have a lot of questions to ask before voting. I want to also talk to you a little bit about one area of questioning. I believe it was Senator Biden who was asking you about Justice Ginsburg and the fact that she answered some questions, but declined others. And we have talked about the Ginsburg standard. I think Senator Schumer referred to that as well. What I understand that to mean, what I mean by that when I say it is that she has recognized that there is a line that a nominee cannot step over in terms of prejudging cases or issues that may come back before the Supreme Court, and that is the line I understand you to have drawn.
But to Justice Ginsburg, as I believe Senator Graham pointed out, had an extensive paper trail and record, and she did feel at some liberty to talk about issues where her views were already public or where she had already written. Is that the distinction? Could you explain your understanding of the distinction she was making or how she handled questions, perhaps in a way that is different from the way you are handling questions?
Judge ROBERTS. My understanding, based on reading the transcript, not just of Justice Ginsburg’s hearing but of the hearings for every one of the Justices on the Court, is that that was her approach, that she would generally decline to comment on whether she viewed particular cases as correctly decided or not. She at one point said that that was the Court’s precedent, she had no agenda to reconsider it, and that was all she was going to say. And in areas where she had written, she thought it was appropriate to discuss more fully because it was an area that she had already publicly commented on, and I understand that to be the distinction as to why she commented on particular areas but not others.
Senator CORNYN. To your knowledge, is the line that you have attempted to walk in these proceedings about being as forthcoming as you can, but recognizing that you have a responsibility not to jeopardize your impartiality, either the perception or the reality, or the impartiality and independence of the judiciary; has that been the line that you have attempted to walk and as you understand previous nominees have attempted to walk?

269
Judge ROBERTS. It is, Senator, with an exception, and the exception is that I have tried to be—to share more of my views with respect to particular cases. I know other nominees have declined, for example, to comment on even a case like Marbury v. Madison because they thought as a theoretical matter it could come before the Court. I tend to take a more practical and pragmatic approach to things, rather than a theoretical or ideological approach. I think as a practical matter, an issue about Marbury v. Madison is not likely to come before the Court, the same with Brown v. Board of Education, so I have gone farther than many nominees and have been willing to talk about my views on those particular cases.
But I do think when it gets into an area where the correctness or incorrectness or my agreement or disagreement with a particular precedent is an area that is likely to come before the Court or could well come before the Court, I do have to draw the line there, and it is not out of any interest to dodge questions or anything. My views on cases that I think are not likely to come before the Court, I’m perfectly willing to discuss. It’s based on the concern that the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court depends upon Justices who go there and will decide the issues there with an open mind based on the judicial decisional process, not based on prior commitments they made during the nomination hearing.
All of the Justices have adhered to that approach for that reason, and if I am to join their number, I need to be able to look them in the eye in the conference room and say, ‘‘I kept the same faith with the independence and integrity of this Court.’’
Senator CORNYN. I think it also may reflect the fact that you seem to be quite comfortable responding to questions from the Committee. You have had a lot of experience responding to questions from the bench and having to distinguish cases, answer hypothetical questions and the like, and I think we have gained an appreciation, a greater appreciation for the skills that you have acquired and your ability, but I understand the line you are walking, and I think it is really a constitutional standard that you are trying to observe, and I applaud you for it.
A couple other areas I want to ask you about, but first let me ask you this. Judges are not in the business of picking winners and losers before they have actually heard the case, of course. I mean that is fundamental to our concept of justice, that a judge be openminded, be willing to listen to the facts and arguments of counsel, and then make a decision.
And the process that you use is by applying neutral principles. In other words, when you make a decision based on the Commerce Clause or even based on stare decisis, does that really have anything to do with the ultimate result? In other words, do you start with the results you want to reach first and then go back and try to rationalize it or justify it by the way you read the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, or apply the legal doctrine of stare decisis?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator. It’s saying a judge is result oriented, that type of judge. That’s about the worst thing you can say about a judge.
Senator CORNYN. Those are almost fighting words.

270
Judge ROBERTS. It’s about the worst thing you can say because what you’re saying is, you don’t apply the law to tell you what the results should be. You don’t go through the judicial decisional process. You don’t look to the principles that are established in the Constitution or the law. You look to what you think the result should be, and then you go back and try to rationalize it, and that’s not the way the system is supposed to work.
Senator CORNYN. Well, I know that we have heard today about a number of terms from stare decisis to pro hac vice, to pro forma, to—the only one we have not heard is res ipsa loquitur and a number of other Latin phrases that we learned in law school.
Let me ask you about stare decisis. I have heard fascinating discussion back and forth about precedent and how you would deal with a case, let’s say for example, Roe v. Wade, and some have suggested, law professors and maybe others, that somehow that is a super precedent, or in the words of our inimitable Chairman, a super-duper precedent. I think we are introducing new words to the legal lexicon as this hearing goes on. But in all seriousness, if— well, let me ask you this. Is stare decisis an insurmountable obstacle to revisiting a decision based on an interpretation of the Constitution?
Judge ROBERTS. What the Supreme Court has said, in the Casey decision, for example, is that it is not an inexorable command. In other words, it’s not an absolute rule, and that’s why they have these various cases that explain the circumstances under which you should revisit a prior precedent that you think may be flawed and when you shouldn’t, and—
Senator CORNYN. I can—excuse me. I did not mean to interrupt you.
Judge ROBERTS. I was just going to say there are significant cases in the Court’s history, in the Nation’s history, where the Court has revisited precedents like Brown v. Board of Education, like the cases that overruled the decisions of the Lochner era.
Senator CORNYN. You started to make the point I was going to try to make next, and that is, stare decisis did not prevent the United States Supreme Court from revisiting Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the separate but equal doctrine, or otherwise Brown v. Board of Education would never be the law of the land. Stare decisis did not prevent the Supreme Court from overruling Bowers v. Hardwick in Lawrence v. Texas or Stanford v. Kentucky in this recent term of the Court, where they said the death penalty for 17-year-old murderers was unconstitutional in Roper v. Simmons.
So would you agree with me, Judge, that this is a neutral principle? In other words, it is not a result-oriented principle, if there is such a thing, and you have pledged to apply neutral principles, not result-oriented processes in arriving at your decisions if confirmed.
Judge ROBERTS. That’s right. It is a neutral principle. The factors that the Court looks at in deciding whether to overrule prior precedent or not do not depend upon what the decision is or what area it’s in, other than some areas, things we’ve talked about, for example, a statutory decision is much more likely to be overturned than

a constitutional decision just because Congress can address those issues themselves.
But the principles of stare decisis are neutral and should be applied in a neutral way to cases without regard to the substance of the decisions being considered.
Senator CORNYN. When you said this morning in response to questions about Roe v. Wade that it is settled as a precedent of the Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis, you were saying that—just that. In other words, that it is a precedent of the Court. There has to be a strong case made for why that issue should be revisited, if at all, but you were not making any commitment one way or another about the outcome of any challenge brought under that or any other legal doctrine, were you?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, and I’ve tried as scrupulously as possible today to avoid making any commitments about cases that might come before the Court.
Senator CORNYN. I agree you have, and I just wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page in that understanding.
Senator Schumer asked about the Commerce Clause, and I have just been fascinated by this debate about the Commerce Clause. Of course, you know, when this Nation got started, of course first we had the Articles of Confederation, where the States were supreme and they could not—the Nation could not function unless all States agreed. And so the Federal Government was essentially impotent, which led of course to the Constitutional Convention and a Federal form of Government, where States and the Federal Government shared powers.
And now it is interesting to hear—of course we have seen a growth of national power over the years through a series of court decisions, and Congress, frankly, has pushed the envelope and tried to argue that Congress has virtually unlimited power to legislate, and can crowd out State governments completely out of any field it wants to.
Isn’t it true that there are specific jurisdictional bases upon which the Congress can legislate? In other words, under the 14th Amendment, Section 5, under the Commerce Clause? In other words, the Constitution of the United States was supposed to be a Constitution of delegated or enumerated powers, and interstate commerce being one of those enumerated powers. Of course, there are other provisions like the Necessary and Proper Clause. There have been a lot of decisions over the years about whether it is only powers expressed or implied and the like.
But isn’t it true that the Supreme Court in the last decade has finally said, in Lopez and in Morrison, for example, that Federal power is not unlimited, that there is some limit and the fight is really over where those limits are? Would you agree with that?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator, and I do think that a proper consideration of Lopez and Morrison has to take into account the more recent Supreme Court decision in Raich, where the Court made the point that, yes, we have these decisions in Lopez and Morrison, but they are part of a 218-year history of decisions applying the Commerce Clause, and they need to be taken into account in the broad scope. It’s an appreciation, again, the first one in 65, 70 years that recognized a limitation on what was within the Congress’s power.

272
But they’re not sort of—they didn’t junk all the cases that came before. They didn’t set a new standard. That’s what the Court said in Raich. It said, yes, we have those two cases, don’t over-read them. Put them in the context and, you know, move on from there. And as the Court in Raich concluded, they upheld the exercise of Congress’s authority.
Senator CORNYN. Well, I don’t think it would come as any surprise to anyone who’s listening to these proceedings outside of the Beltway that our Government was premised in part on the notion that all wisdom does not emanate from Washington, D.C., and that the States do have areas of competence and authority to the exclusion of the Federal Government. And one of the great things, I think, about this hearing is that a lot of people, I think, are learning and hearing about concepts that perhaps they had never heard about before, but really, these are debates that have occurred since the beginning of America itself and since the formation of our Government.
So I hope that this is an educational experience or maybe even a refresher course for many of us about some basic principles upon which our Government was founded. And, of course, the most important principle from my standpoint is that articulated in the Declaration of Independence itself that says that our laws are based on consent of the governed, which means that most of the debates we have about the laws and the policies that govern us and affect our families and our jobs are going to be decided in the political realm, where people can muster majorities and vote and have laws signed and people who are in the minority may live to fight another day and turn that law over in the political forum, and that very few cases, very few issues will be completely removed from that political forum. And those are the cases where the Constitution precludes legislative activity.
But I very much appreciate your expression of the role of a judge is one having a sense of humility and modesty. That is not to say from the way I look at it, or I am sure the way you look at it, that the job of a judge is unimportant. Being a judge is not easy all the time because you have to make tough decisions which may not be politically popular, but that is what goes along with the territory. But I appreciate the distinction that you have made and articulated for us here in preserving the vast majority of the debates and issues that affect each of us in America and our families and our jobs as one where we can govern ourselves through our elected representatives, and if we don’t like the way that our elected officials are deciding things, we can throw the rascals out. But we can’t do that when it comes to an appointed, lifetime-tenure Justice on the Supreme Court. And so I appreciate very much the distinction that you are drawing.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I will surrender back two and a half minutes. Thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Cornyn. Senator Durbin? Senator LEAHY. I thank you, too. [Laughter.] Senator DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

273
Judge Roberts, Mrs. Roberts, family and friends, the end is near—at least for this leg of the race. Welcome to night court.
[Laughter.] Senator DURBIN. I was struck by a question by Senator Grassley and your answer earlier today. The question was this: ‘‘Well, is there any room in constitutional interpretation for the judge’s own values or beliefs?’’ And your response: ‘‘No, I don’t think there is. Sometimes it’s hard to give meaning to a constitutional term in a particular case. But you don’t look to your own values and beliefs. You look outside yourself to other sources.’’ Judge Roberts, I recently finished a book about Justice Blackmun and his service on the Supreme Court, and it was a fascinating book about his life on the Court and his life on the Federal judiciary. And I found it interesting that near the end of his term on the Court, a couple cases occurred which really spoke to the heart of the man. One was DeShaney v. Winnebago County, involving a poor little boy who had been beaten and abused, and left retarded, by dereliction of duty by many of the county officials or State officials in Wisconsin, and an effort by his mother to hold them accountable. They failed in the Supreme Court. But Justice Blackmun wrote a dissent, in which he made reference to ‘‘Poor Joshua.’’ And he said at one point, in response to someone who wrote him afterwards, about the Court, ‘‘Sometimes we overlook the individual’s concern, the fact that these are live human beings that are so deeply and terribly affected by our decisions.’’ The other thing that occurred in Blackmun’s judicial career was a real change in his view on the death penalty, and I think most of us are aware of the famous statement which he made: ‘‘From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.’’ The last case in which he participated involving the death penalty was a case that you were involved in, the Herrera case. You were Deputy Solicitor General at that time. It involved the case of an individual in Texas who had been accused of killing two police officers, and who tried to reopen his case offering evidence that his brother, who had since died, had actually been the killer. He turned to the Federal court because he had lost his time for reconsideration of the case by Texas law, and he argued a claim of actual innocence. Justice Blackmun, in his statement at the end of this case, said, ‘‘Of one thing, however, I am certain. Just as an execution without adequate safeguards is unacceptable, so too is an execution when the condemned prisoner can prove that he is innocent. The execution of a person who can show that he is innocent comes perilously close to simple murder.’’ That was a dissent—that addressed your position that you had espoused as Deputy Solicitor General. Did you read that Blackmun dissent? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator, I did. Senator DURBIN. Were you struck by the language there? And the reason I ask that question is it has been 11 years since we have had a Supreme Court nominee before us, and a lot of things have happened in relation to the death penalty in America. We have looked closely at defendants who were young, those who were

not mentally sufficient to stand trial, and we also now have the issue of DNA.
In my State of Illinois, we found 13 people on death row who were innocent people, and a Republican Governor pardoned them after the evidence came out.
Tell me in that context, as you look at this and talk about this, what appeared to be a very sterile and bloodless process as you answered Senator Grassley, tell me what goes through your mind and your heart when you think about addressing the death penalty, what happened in the Herrera case and what we should look to from the Court in the future when it comes to the Eighth Amendment and to the death penalty.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think it’s important, first of all, to appreciate that the issue in the Herrera case I think was misportrayed as an issue of actual innocence. The issue in the Herrera case is at what point should new claims—in this case, the claim after his brother died, well, guess what, I didn’t do it, my brother did it, and he’s dead now. That is to some extent a claim of innocence, but it’s the sort of claim that did not have, as the courts determined there, sufficient factual support to be taken seriously. That’s quite different from a claim, for example, of DNA evidence. Now, that’s an issue that’s working its way up, and I don’t want to comment on it, other than to say that it seems to me that that type of claim— that somebody who just died was the actual murderer is different from the scientific issue. They’re just different cases. So I don’t think that one should be taken as suggesting a view on the other.
Obviously, any case involving the death penalty is different. The Court has recognized that. The irrevocability calls for the most careful scrutiny. It is not an area in which I’ve had to consider cases as a judge up to this point, and I certainly know the magnitude of the concern and the scrutiny that all the Justices bring to that question. It’s just different than other cases. There’s no doubt about that. And DNA evidence obviously I think is a very important and critical issue. No one wants an innocent person executed, period. And the availability of that type of evidence, that opportunity in some cases, I think is something that’s a very significant development in the law.
Now, as I said, there are cases coming up in there, so I don’t want to say anything further.
Senator DURBIN. I understand that. It is unfortunate that the decision was made by the White House not to provide the memos and writings on the 16 cases when you served as Deputy Solicitor General. Herrera was one of the cases. And so we might have learned a little more about the thinking at that time that led to your conclusion.
Let me ask you, I have been here most of the day, and you have been here all day. And I have noted how often you have distanced yourself from the memos written as a 26-year-old staff attorney. And I understand that. That is a long time ago. When we met in my office, that is, I think, exactly what you said when I referred to one of those memos. But I would like to ask you this: When you were serving in the Reagan Administration and the first Bush administration, was there ever a time when you stood up to your con-

servative colleagues and advocated a position that was more favorable to victims of discrimination or the disadvantaged?
Judge ROBERTS. There certainly were internal disagreements and internal disputes about which approach to take, and in many cases, I’d be on one side; in other cases, I’d be on the other side, certainly.
Now, again, those are internal deliberations, but there was debate and disagreement on a regular basis. That’s part of the nature of the job.
Senator DURBIN. But there was one case in particular that hasn’t been mentioned today that I would like to ask you about, and that was the case involving Bob Jones University. That was one of the most troubling decisions of the Reagan Administration. It was a decision to argue before the Supreme Court that Bob Jones University should keep its tax-exempt status with the IRS even though it had an official policy that banned interracial dating, and denied admission to any applicants who engaged in interracial marriage, or were known to advocate interracial marriage or dating.
When the Reagan Administration took that position, it reversed the position of three previous administrations, including two Republicans, all of whom argued that Bob Jones was not eligible for this tax-exempt status. This sudden reversal by the Reagan Justice Department, which you were part of at the time, led to the unusual step of the Supreme Court appointing a special counsel, William Coleman, as a friend of the Court, to argue in support of the IRS. In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 against the Reagan Administration and against Bob Jones University.
Judge Roberts, there was a heated debate within the Justice Department about whether or not to defend Bob Jones University and its racist policies. More than 200 lawyers and employees of the Civil Rights Division, representing half of all the employees in that division, signed a letter of protest. William Bradford Reynolds, the head of the Civil Rights Division, strongly supported defending Bob Jones. Ted Olson, another person well known in Washington, opposed this defense of Bob Jones.
Which side were you on? What role did you play in the decision to defend Bob Jones University policy?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I was ethically barred from taking a position on that case. I was just coming off of my clerkship on the Supreme Court, which ended in the summer of 1981. Supreme Court rules said that you could not participate in any way in a matter before the Supreme Court for a certain period of time—I think it was 2 years, or whatever it was—and it was within that period. This involved an issue before the Supreme Court. So I was ethically barred from participating in that in any way.
Senator DURBIN. The memo of December 5, 1983, that you wrote about the Bob Jones University leads one to believe in reading it that you were present during deliberations on this policy. Is that true?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator. Senator DURBIN. You were not? Judge ROBERTS. I was not involved in the policy because of the bar on the participation. Senator DURBIN. There appears to be another memo which I am going to send to you dated September 29, 1982, with your hand-

writing on it relative to this same issue, and I don’t want to surprise you with it. I will send it to you and if tomorrow we get a chance, we can revisit it.
Let me ask you this. When— Chairman SPECTER. Senator Durbin, may we have the numbers there? The staff needs those in order to put the document into the record. Senator DURBIN. Sure. I would be happy to. This is dated September 29, 1982. Chairman SPECTER. And it has a number on it? Senator DURBIN. No number, but we will give you a copy. Chairman SPECTER. Okay. Thank you. Senator DURBIN. We will share it with the Judge. I want you to have it; this is not a surprise. Judge ROBERTS. Sure. Senator DURBIN. I just want you to take a look at it. We had a nominee for the Ninth Circuit court of appeals, Carolyn Kuhl. Do you know her personally? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator DURBIN. You served in the Justice Department with her? Judge ROBERTS. Right. Senator DURBIN. When she came before this committee, Senator Leahy asked her several questions and she said when she testified, quote, ‘‘I regret having taken the position that I did in support of the Government’s change of position [on Bob Jones]. The nondiscrimination principle and the importance of enforcement of the civil rights laws by the executive branch should have taken sway and should have been primary in making that decision.’’ I appreciated her candor on that. What is your belief? Was the Reagan administration position on Bob Jones University the right position to take? Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator. In retrospect, I think it’s clear. The people who were involved in it, as you say, themselves think that it was the incorrect position. I certainly don’t disagree with that. Senator DURBIN. Thank you. Let me move to another topic— Senator LEAHY. I am sorry, Senator. I didn’t hear the answer. Judge ROBERTS. The answer is, no, I don’t think it was the correct position to take. Senator DURBIN. Thank you. Earlier, Senator Feinstein asked you about the separation of church and state and I would like to follow up on this. She asked whether you believed the separation of church-state was absolute, and I have your answer here relative to the two recent cases on the Ten Commandments. It appears now that there is debate within the Court as to whether or not they will stand behind the Lemon v. Kurtzman standards under the Establishment Clause, the three-part test, which I won’t go through in detail. As Deputy Solicitor General of the Bush administration, you coauthored two legal briefs in which you urged the Supreme Court to overrule the Lemon standard, Board of Education v. Mergens and Lee v. Weisman. You argued instead for what has been characterized in shorthand as the legal coercion test. So I would like to ask you, what is your view on the Establishment Clause and the Lemon standard at this point in time?

277
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the Lemon test is a survivor. There’s no other way to put it. When we wrote the brief in Lee v. Weisman, we had a long footnote explaining that, I think it was six different members of the current Court had expressed their criticisms of the Lemon test. They never got together at the same time and the test has endured.
The approach that we were advocating in Lee v. Weisman did focus on the question of coercion and argued that in certain circumstances, a recognition of ceremonial religious practices—an invocation at a graduation was the one at issue there—were permissible, and again, that, I think, lost five-to-four.
And the Lemon test to this day is the test that the Court applies. I think one of the Justices recently explained, you know, it’s not so much how good the Lemon test is, it’s that nobody can agree on an alternative to take its place, and there may be something to that. There are cases where the Court doesn’t apply the Lemon test. It seems to follow a different approach.
The great benefit of the Lemon test, the three-part test that everybody’s familiar with, of course, is that it’s very sensitive to factual nuances. The disadvantage of the Lemon test, I think, is that it’s very sensitive to factual nuances and you get a situation like with the Ten Commandments case, and again, I’m not commenting on the correctness or not, but those are two decisions and there is exactly one Justice that thinks they’re both right.
Nobody would suggest that this is an area of the law where the Court’s precedents are crystal clear, and I think there may be some inevitability to that. There is a tension of sorts between the Establishment Clause, on the one hand, and the Free Exercise Clause on the other, and the Court’s cases in recent years have tried to consider when is an accommodation for religious belief—when does that go too far and become an establishment of religion? The Court has a case on its docket coming up.
I think the animating principle of the Framers that’s reflected in both of the religion clauses is that no one should be denied rights of full citizenship because of their religious belief or their lack of religious belief. That is the underlying principle. That is, I think, what the Framers were trying to accomplish.
The jurisprudence, again, it’s an area where the Court has adhered through thick and thin to the Lemon test, probably because they can’t come up with anything better, but the results sometimes, I think, are a little difficult to comprehend.
Senator DURBIN. Now, of course, Justice Rehnquist had a different point of view, or at least he alluded to one when he appeared before this Committee in 1986. Senator Simon asked him a question. He replied as follows. ‘‘I have in my opinions read the Establishment Clause more narrowly than some of my colleagues. . . . But I also think, Senator Simon, that these are almost questions of degree and that there is not a tremendous amount of difference there as to the broad principles of the Establishment Clause are uncontroverted, and those kinds of cases do not get up to us because they are pretty well settled. It is these kinds of frontier-type cases that come up and reflect divisions among us and I certainly have read the Establishment Clause more narrowly than some of my colleagues.’’

278
Do you feel that you are reading the Establishment Clause from a narrow point of view or from the traditional Lemon point of view?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t think I’ve had an Establishment Clause case. The cases where I have argued, I obviously was representing the position of the administration, which was that the Lemon test was regarded by the administration as too manipulable, not determinative, and in some senses inconsistent. So those—with the understanding of the Framers. So that was the position that we were advocating there. I haven’t expressed my personal views on the Establishment Clause in any context.
Senator DURBIN. Well, let me read what you wrote in a memo on June 4, 1985, to Fred Fielding when you were serving as a staff attorney, related to Wallace v. Jaffree. Here is what you wrote in reference to Establishment Clause and the Lemon test:
‘‘Thus, as I see it, Rehnquist took a tenuous five-person majority and tried to revolutionize Establishment Clause jurisprudence, and ended up losing the majority. Which is not to say the effort was misguided. In the larger scheme of things what is important is not whether this law is upheld or struck down, but what test is applied.’’
I know you have said over and over again that you were just doing what you were paid to do, to tell the administration what they wanted to hear. Is that what happened here?
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t think I’ve said that. Seenator DURBIN. Well, that’s correct. Strike that from the record. Let me just say you were a staff attorney reflecting the views of the administration you worked for. Is that a correct characterization? Judge ROBERTS. It’s a correct view. The views of the administration were quite clear with respect to the moment of silence, which was the issue in Wallace v. Jaffree. It was the President’s view that it was constitutional, through the Attorney General, that it was constitutional to observe a moment of silence. Now, what the Court held in Wallace, of course, was that you couldn’t look at just the moment of silence. There was a history there about school-led prayer, and to substitute it and suddenly say, well, now it is a moment of silence, they didn’t look at it in those terms but looked at it in the long history and the issue of whether a real moment of silence without that kind of background and history, whether that would prevail or not was one that the Court didn’t address in Wallace. Senator DURBIN. Let me just wrap this up by asking, and I think you have alluded to this, is it your belief that what we are trying to establish in the constitutional protection on the exercise of religion is not only to protect minorities, religious minorities, but also non-believers? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. The Court’s decisions in that area are quite clear, and I think the Framers’ intent was, as well, that it was not their intent to just have a protection for denominational discrimination. It was their intent to leave this as an area of privacy apart—a conscience from which the Government would not intrude. Senator DURBIN. Thank you. The next topic I would like to talk about for a moment is Executive power, which has been addressed earlier. It has not been a major focus in previous hearings, but ob-

viously is now that we are at war. You have been asked a lot of questions about it because I think there is so much at stake. We will probably be involved in this war effort, as Senator Leahy said early this morning, for some time.
Throughout American history, even some of our greatest Presidents, including one from Illinois named Lincoln, tried to restrict liberty in an effort to provide more safety and security in our Nation. This administration is no exception. It has claimed the right to seize an American citizen in the United States and hold him indefinitely without charging him with a crime. It has claimed that the courts have no right to intervene. I think that threatens all of our freedoms.
Just last week, Judge Luttig of the Fourth Circuit court of appeals authored an opinion upholding the administration’s position. If you are confirmed, you may have the final word on this question. You and others have compared the role of a judge to an umpire, and I promised I wouldn’t get into the baseball analogy, so that is one thing I will spare you from.
But let me ask you this. When it comes to the use of Executive power, you have referred time and again to Justice Jackson in the Youngstown case. Here is what he said: ‘‘A judge, like an Executive advisor, may be surprised at the poverty of really useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of Executive powers as they actually present themselves.’’
So if you are confirmed, you will play a significant role in determining what limits, if any, the Constitution places on a President during times of war. That is why the American people have the right to know what you think about Executive power.
There was an exchange earlier today between you and Senator Kyl about a statement I made yesterday about whether, as a Justice, you will expand freedom in America, and Senator Kyl seemed to suggest it was a zero-sum approach, that you couldn’t enlarge the freedom of one person or group in America without taking away the freedom of another group.
It is a curious point of view. It is the same point of view that Robert Bork had that he tried to defend unsuccessfully before this Committee many years ago.
But my point to you is this. What is in your background or experience that can convince the members of this Committee and the American people that you are willing to stand up to this President if he oversteps his authority in this time of war, even if it is an unpopular thing to do?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I would just say that my demonstrated commitment to the rule of law, you can see that, I think, in my opinions over the past 2 years, you can see it in how I approach my job as a lawyer, arguing, and what types of arguments I make and how I make those arguments and how faithful they are to the precedents, and you can see it in my history of public service.
The idea that the rule of law—that’s the only client I have as a judge. The Constitution is the only interest I have as a judge. The notion that I would compromise my commitment to that principle that has been the lodestar of my professional life since I became a lawyer because of views toward a particular administration is one

280
that I reject entirely. That would be inconsistent with the judicial oath, and Justice Jackson is a perfect example of that. He is someone who was a strong advocate for Executive power when he was FDR’s Attorney General, one of the strongest, and yet he could issue a decision like the Youngstown decision not only concluding that President Truman lacked the authority, even in times of war, to seize the steel mills, but also setting forth the framework with the language of the sort that you just quoted, setting forth the framework about how to analyze these decisions in a way that is particularly sensitive to the role of Congress, as well. That is the key feature of his framework, the examination of where Congress is on the spectrum in determining whether the Executive has that authority.
Senator DURBIN. I hate to keep referring back to these ancient memos, but it is said that if a hammer is the only tool you have, every problem looks like a nail. And in this case, this is the only tool we have to try to find out what is going on in your mind and in your heart. And so in a memo of 1983 to White House Counsel Fred Fielding, you wrote about ‘‘the independent prerogative of the Chief Executive to determine that a given law is unconstitutional.’’ You talked about the power of the Executive to determine that a law is unconstitutional.
We are going through this debate that Senator Leahy alluded to earlier about this torture memo and the idea that the administration would walk away from commitments that have been made under Geneva Conventions and under the Convention on Torture, and would instead establish a new standard. So my question to you is this: Would the anti-torture statute be unconstitutional simply because it conflicts with an order issued by the President as Commander in Chief?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, not simply because of the conflict, and I have to say I don’t know—that’s one of the 80,000 memos I don’t know about, so I’d have to understand what the point was, what the issue was, and the language you read in context before I could respond to that.
But, no, the President has an obligation. He takes an oath, as we all do, to uphold the Constitution and to make a determination, and his determination that certain things are either constitutional or unconstitutional can, of course, in an appropriate case be tested in court. And the ultimate arbiter of that under our system is the Federal judiciary.
Senator DURBIN. Justice Jackson thought the bottom line on Executive power was clear in Youngstown. He said, ‘‘No penance would ever expiate the sin against free government of holding that a President can escape control of Executive powers by law through assuming his military role.’’ I assume you agree with that statement by Justice Jackson?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, I do. It simply reflects the basic principle that no man is above the law, not the President and not the Congress. And that’s why courts have the obligation and have had since Marbury v. Madison to say what the law is. And if that means that Congress has acted unconstitutionally, they strike down the law. And if it means that the Executive has acted unconstitutionally, they have the obligation to block the Executive action.

281
Senator DURBIN. We can imagine a hypothetical statute that would clearly intrude on a President’s power as Commander in Chief, ordering the movement of troops and that sort of thing. On the other hand, the anti-torture statute is clearly within the area, I believe, where Congress can legislate. As you noted this morning, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution enumerates Congress’s powers. Speaking clearly, it says Congress shall have the power ‘‘To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.’’
I think we have exhausted this topic, and I think we are in common feeling and agreement about it. I hope we are at least close.
Let me ask you one last question in the few minutes remaining here. I have listened to some of the questions asked about gender and sex discrimination. They have come up repeatedly during the course of this. And as you look at the standards that are applied to equal protection for a variety of different circumstances, there are different standards. I think you started to explain them at one point today. Maybe you got through the explanation, I am not sure. But under strict scrutiny, the suspect classifications include race and national origin, religion, alienage, and the like. Then there is, of course, the other standard of what is characterized as middletier scrutiny, which includes quasi-suspect classifications of gender and illegitimacy.
As you look back at the sweep of history that created these different standards, can you rationalize the difference between discrimination based on race and based on gender?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I can tell you what the Court has done. There are Justices who aren’t comfortable with the different tiers. They say there’s one Equal Protection Clause. But the different tiers are fairly well establish as an approach to the different areas in discrimination. And the rationale for it is that there are areas in which you think it is almost never the case that distinctions that are drawn can be legitimate, distinctions based on race or ethnicity. And so they’re subject to the most heightened scrutiny.
The rational relation test which applies across the board to any type of law, there it’s quite often the case that distinctions drawn on whatever basis Congress wants are likely to reflect the different sorts of policy judgments.
Gender issues are in the middle tier because the Court thinks that there are situations where distinctions can be justified, and there are other situations—but it’s more than just the rational relation, but not as suspect as the most heightened level because there may be other justifications. Cases throughout the Court’s history where they have upheld distinctions under that analysis, like the all-male draft, for example, that was upheld.
Now, if you had applied strict scrutiny to that type of classification, perhaps the result would have been different and the all-male draft would have been struck down. It reflects the Court’s determination that these are not sort of almost always inherently irrational and discrimination rather than legitimate governmental distinctions, but that it’s entitled to a heightened degree of scrutiny beyond the rational relation test. Justice Ginsburg, I think, in her opinion in the VMI case said that the intermediate scrutiny had to be applied with—I forget the exact phrase—‘‘exacting rigor’’ or

282 something along those lines, to indicate that it is well beyond the rational relation test, but it’s not as inherently suspect as racial classifications.
Senator DURBIN. Judge Roberts, thank you today for your patience with the Committee and your responses to my questions.
Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Senator DURBIN. I think we all understand the gravity of this hearing, as you do, and we thank you very much for bringing your family and friends to be with you. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Durbin, and thank you all for sitting through a very long proceeding today. We are in our 11th hour. Thank you, Judge Roberts, thank you, Senator Leahy. You were here all day. And I thank all my colleagues, most of whom have been here practically all day. Senators have other responsibilities, and when we set the time and stick to it, they know when to come in to find the time. There has been, I think, a spirit of good will generally, dignified generally, contentious at times, but I think productive. We will begin tomorrow morning at 9 o’clock, 9:00 a.m. instead of 9:30, begin at 9:00 a.m., and we will start with the questioning, 30 minutes to Senator Brownback. That concludes our day’s session.

NOMINATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., OF MARYLAND, TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2005
UNITED STATES SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:02 a.m., in room SH–216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman SPECTER. The Committee will now proceed with the confirmation hearing of Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. One preliminary statement. I noted after the session yesterday that there was some comment about my statement when I asked Senator Biden to allow you to continue to respond or to respond at all, and he then interjected that you were misleading the Committee. My statement was, ‘‘While they may be misleading, they are his answers.’’ It was in the subjunctive, and I was not suggesting that your answers were misleading. But in that moment, the object was to let you answer. If somebody wants to characterize them one way or another, they can do that, and you can respond. And I was not suggesting in any way, shape, or form that they were misleading. And you picked it right up and said that they were not misleading. There are sometimes differences of opinion between the person asking the question and the person answering the question, but there was no doubt in my mind as to the fact that they were not misleading. We now proceed with the final two Senators on the opening 30minute round, and I recognize Senator Brownback. Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I welcome you, Judge Roberts, Mrs. Roberts. Judge ROBERTS. Good morning. Senator BROWNBACK. Glad to have you here this morning. You are only two away from the end of this round, and we will see how much further it goes. I hope you had a good night’s sleep, and I thought you had a great presentation yesterday. I want to compliment you on the number of areas that you answered. My colleague from Texas went through the number of areas and com-

mented about that yesterday, and I was very impressed with the breadth, obviously, of your knowledge and your forthcomingness, how many of these areas you answered where prior nominees had not put answers forth. And so I think you have revealed a great deal, and yet not gone into those areas of active judicial action where there could be a lot of things coming forward.
I also want to compliment the Chairman, Chairman Specter, who originates from my home State, on his stamina. He has been going through a lot lately, the Chairman has, and yet you have pressed this Committee so that many of us have difficulty keeping up with you. And I want to compliment you on that stamina and the ability that you show. You always set a fast pace.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, Senator Brownback, being a Kansan yourself, you know where that stamina came from, because I am a Kansan myself.
Senator BROWNBACK. It comes from standing in the wind all day long. You just have to lean into it. It strengthens you quite a bit.
I want to go to a few areas that you have not answered questions on yet. It may be a surprise to some watching that there are any areas left, but actually there are quite a few. And with your service on the Court, you are going to get such a range of issues and topics that are going to come up. It is noteworthy to me that a majority of Committee members have asked you about privacy and leading up to questions on Roe, which I think only strengthens the point that this is an issue that should be left into the political system and not into the judicial system where it is today. That is something you will have to resolve as issues like partial-birth abortion come up to you, but the very dominance of the question bespeaks of its interest within the political system and why it is best resolved within the political system and not the judicial one on a constitutional basis. But I will get to that later.
I want to take you first to the Takings Clause issue. There was a recent case that came up that really shocked the system, and you talked about shocks to the system when the judiciary acts. This is one that did it in the Kelo v. City of New London case. In perhaps no other area of the law is stability more important than in the area of private property and property rights. Even before the existence of the United States, William Blackstone, that famous English legal authority, stated this: ‘‘The law of the land postpones even public necessity to the sacred and inviolable rights of private property.’’
Mindful of the sentiment and the excesses of the King, yet aware of the needs of a new and growing country, the Framers of our Constitution established a strict limitation on the Government’s ability to take private property. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution provides that private property may not ‘‘be taken for public use, without just compensation.’’ We all know those famous words.
Traditionally, this has meant that the Government had to pay fair value when it sought to confiscate a homeowner’s property in order to build a road or other public good. But now the notion of public use has taken on a different hue to it. In the Kelo case, the Supreme Court decided whether a private economic development plan, which the city government believed would yield greater eco-

285
nomic benefits, qualified as a public use. So you had private property taken by the State and given back to private individuals, but it was having a greater economic use, and whether that was sufficient under the Takings Clause.
In the words of the Court, this economic development plan ‘‘was projected’’ not resulted, but projected ‘‘to create in excess of a thousand jobs to increase taxes and other revenues.’’ On this basis, the Court upheld the Government confiscation as a public use, and there was an uproar across the country. We thought that private property rights were established and set. And now it appears as if it is not, that the system is different. You can take private property under the Government’s eminent domain power and give it back to a private individual.
Justice O’Connor in her eloquent dissent said this: ‘‘Nothing is to prevent the State now from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.’’
It is remarkable how this issue has stirred, as I mentioned, great criticism. I am pleased the Chairman is going to hold a hearing on it this next week. Judge Roberts, what is your understanding of the state of the Takings Clause jurisprudence now after Kelo? Isn’t it now the case that it is much easier for one man’s home to become another man’s castle?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, under the Kelo decision, which, as you explained, was interpreting the public use requirement in the Constitution, the majority—and, of course, as you mentioned, it was a closely divided case. The majority explained its reasoning by noting the difficulty in drawing the line. Everybody would agree, as you suggest, to build a road or to build a railroad, to situate a military base, if that is the only suitable place, that the power of eminent domain is appropriate in those instances. And I think people agree further that when you’re talking about a hospital or something like that, that satisfies public use. And I think the reason the Court gave, really, in the majority opinion was that it’s kind of hard to draw the line.
The dissent, Justice O’Connor’s dissent, didn’t think it was that hard. She focused on the question of whether it was going to be a use open to the public as, you know, a road, a hospital, use for the public like in a military base, or private. And she would have drawn the line there and said even public benefits that derive from different private uses don’t justify that aspect of it.
There was a caveat in the Kelo majority. They said they were only deciding this in the context of an urban redevelopment plan. They reserved the question—if it’s just taking one parcel and giving it to everybody else, not part of a broader plan, that question was still open. And as you say, there’s been a lot of reaction to it. I understand some States have even legislated restricting their power.
Senator BROWNBACK. And we are considering it here in the Congress.
Judge ROBERTS. And I think that’s a very appropriate approach to consider. In other words, the Court was not saying you have to have this power, you have to exercise this power. What the Court was saying is there is this power, and then it’s up to the legislature

286
to determine whether it wants that to be available, whether it wants it to be available in limited circumstances, or whether it wants to go back to an understanding as reflected in the dissent, that this is not an appropriate public use.
That leaves the ball in the court of the legislature, and I think it’s reflective of what is often the case and people sometimes lose sight of, that this body and legislative bodies in the States are protectors of the people’s rights as well. It’s not simply a question of legislating to address particular needs, but you obviously have to also be cognizant of the people’s rights and you can protect them in situations where the Court has determined, as it did 5–4 in Kelo, that they are not going to draw that line. You still have the authority to draw—
Senator BROWNBACK. I understand the authority we maintain. What I’m curious about is your view on whether that right exists. I would not think Blackstone would agree that that right exists for the public to take private property for private use.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, the first year in law school we all read the decision in Calder v. Bull, which has the famous statement that the Government may not take the property of A and give it to B. And that certainly was quoted in the dissent, in Justice O’Connor’s dissent. The Kelo majority, though, said if a legislature wants to exercise that power, basically that the Court’s not going to second-guess the judgment that this is a public use. And I do think that imposes a heavy responsibility on the legislature to determine what they’re doing and whether it is a public use or if it’s simply transferring from one private party to the next. But—
Senator BROWNBACK. I take it you are not going to respond whether or not that right exists under the Constitution.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the Kelo decision obviously was just decided last year, and I don’t think I should comment whether it was correct or not. It stands as a precedent of the Court. It did leave open the question of whether it applied in the situation that was not a broader redevelopment plan. And if the issue does come back before the Court, I need to be able to address it without having previously commented on it.
Senator BROWNBACK. Let me take you to another area that is stewing here in legislative bodies, certainly across the United States and certainly in Congress, and that is the issue of checks and balances of the Court. Any civics student can talk about checks and balances within the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branch, and we all know that Congress, when it passes a bill, can be checked by a veto of the President. And we know the President’s power can be checked by the power of the purse in the Congress. And when popular elected branches of Government enact bills contrary to the Constitution, the courts can strike the law down by exercising judicial review.
One curiosity, though, especially given the broad sweep of judicial power in America today and the angst that that stirs among so many people, is what check there is on the Court. And it seems to me critical that we have this discussion at this point in time.
The first check on the judiciary, of course, is the President’s ability to populate the bench, to which you are a nominee, and our ability to offer advice and consent. A greater problem arises once

a Federal judge is on the bench and what is in Article III, section 1—and this is getting a lot of discussion now here in this body, where judges hold office during good behavior, which I know you will have, effectively have life tenure. But that is not really an effective check in the system.
There is also another area that you wrote about when you were working within the Reagan administration and that was the ability of Congress to limit the authority and the review of the courts, of what you would have, and I want to look at that in particular. It is the power to define jurisdiction that we would have. It is in Article III, section 2, and I just want to read this because I do not think it is well understood as the check and balance, and I want to get your reaction to it. This is Article III, section 2, ‘‘In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction.’’ No question there.
It goes on: ‘‘In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.’’
That phrase, you know, is known as the Exceptions Clause. You wrote about this when you were in the Reagan White House, about this Exceptions Clause, and you stated this: ‘‘It stands as a plenary grant of power to Congress to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The clause, by its terms, contains no limit’’—these are your words, and ‘‘this clear and unequivocal language is the strongest argument in favor of congressional power and the inevitable stumbling block for those who would read the clause in a more restrictive fashion.’’
Now, I also understand that you also argued on policy grounds this is not a good idea for the Congress to do, but would you agree with those earlier statements that you made about the nature of this power being a plenary power of the Congress, which stands as a clear standard in favor of the Congress ability to be able to limit the jurisdiction of the Courts?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, Senator, that that writing was done at the request of the Attorney General, and he asked me specifically to present the arguments in favor of that power. He was receiving from elsewhere in the Department a memorandum saying that this was unconstitutional, the exercise of that authority. He wanted to see the other view before making up his mind for the Department, so I was tasked to present the arguments in favor of constitutionality. And as you say, they focus and start with the language in the Constitution, the Exceptions Clause, which is as you read it, and I went on to explain that it had been interpreted in the famous case of Ex parte McCardle around the time of the Civil War, which seemed to suggest that the Framers meant what that language says on its face. Also though, a later case, United States v. Klein suggested that there were limits on the power of Congress in this area.
It is a central debate among legal scholars, the scope of that authority. The argument on the other side, the one that the Attorney General adopted, rather than the argument he asked me to present, is that it is the essential function of the Supreme Court

288
to provide uniformity and consistency in Federal law, and that if you carve out exceptions in its constitutional area, that you deprive it of that ability and that that itself violates the constitutional scheme. It’s an area in which most distinguished scholars line up on either side because it does call into question basic relationships between the Congress and the Courts.
Senator BROWNBACK. Could that language be any clearer though in the Exceptions Clause? I mean I understand how legal scholars maybe can debate what a single word means, but that language is pretty clear, is it not?
Judge ROBERTS. The argument on the other side says that it’s intended to apply to—well, for example, we have clear situations in the lower Federal Courts like the amount-in-controversy, those cases are excluded. You can have rules about timing. The question is whether it was intended to address for constitutional areas or simply more administrative matters.
The argument on the other side says if you get into the core constitutional areas, that undermines the Supreme Court’s authority that the Framers didn’t intend that.
Senator BROWNBACK. Then what check is there on the Court’s power?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think the primary check is the same one that Alexander Hamilton talked about in the Federalist Papers, because the exact argument was raising in the debates about the Constitution. People were concerned about a new judiciary, what was it going to do? They were concerned that it might deprive them of their rights. And of course, Hamilton’s famous answer was that judiciary was going to be the least dangerous branch because it had no power. It didn’t have the sword. It didn’t have the purse. And the judges were not going to be able to deprive people of their liberty because they were going to be bound down by rules and precedents. They were going to just interpret the law. And if judges just interpreted the law, there was no threat to liberty from the judicial branch.
So I would say the primary check on the courts has always been judicial self-restraint, and a recognition on the part of judges that they have a limited task, that they are insulated from the people. They’re given life tenure, as you mentioned, precisely because they’re not shaping policy. They’re not supposed to be responsive. They’re supposed to just interpret the law.
Senator BROWNBACK. I guess that is the area that has so many people concerned: it is that the judiciary does not show restraint and if you do not restrain yourselves, then who does within this system? Obviously there are restraints on the Congress, there are restraints on the President. We like that system. We want that check and balance system. I think the Framers put that Exceptions Clause and other things in there for a clear purpose, for a clear reason.
Let me take you on to another area because that one I think you are going to see a lot of action as you get pushing back and forth between the three branches of Government, and a number of people feeling like the judiciary has not show judicial restraint in recent years.

289
I want to take you to the now probably most contentious social issues of our day, and you have been debating and discussing it a great deal here already, the issue of abortion. It is at the root of much of the debate taking place in the country today. It has inflamed people. It has gotten them involved in the political process, folks that probably would not have been previously, because the only way they aware that they could affect the system was get involved and try to elect a President and Senate. It was the President’s lead applause line the last election cycle, was ‘‘I will appoint judges who will be judges, not legislators.’’ That it is an applause line at a political rally should say something about people’s angst towards what the courts have done, and particularly when it comes to this issue of abortion.
The very root of the issue is the legal status of the unborn child. This is an old debate, and whether that child is a person or is a piece of property, is at the root of that debate. Our legal system says you are one of the two, you are either a person or you are a piece of property. If you are a person, you have rights. If you are a piece of property you can be done with as your master chooses.
I believe everyone agrees that the unborn child is alive, and most agree that biologically it is a life, it is a separate genetic entity. But many will dispute whether it is a person. These may be legal definitions, but that is the way people would define it.
Could you state your view as to whether the unborn child is a person or is a piece of property?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, because cases are going to come up in this area, and that could be the focus of legal argument in those cases, I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to comment on that one way or another.
I will confront issues in this area as I would confront issues in any area that come before the Court, and that would be to fully and fairly consider the arguments presented and decide them according to the rule of law. And I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to express views in an area that could come before the Court.
Senator BROWNBACK. I would hope that you would agree with me that this is at the core of the issue, obviously the competition between the woman’s right to choose and the legal status of the unborn, and it permeates so much of our debate, and that is why a lot of us believe it should be within the political system to discuss.
I want to point out one thing to you, and I do not think this probably needs to be addressed, but I want to point it out. My State is the proud home State of Brown v. Board of Education, and I personally knew two of the lawyers that practiced in that case, and they were noble, noble gentlemen.
In Brown, the Supreme Court overturned Plessy, as you knew and as you know, which was an 1896 case, so Plessy had stood for nearly 60 years. We had a discussion about this super stare decisis issue, and I just want to hold up a quick chart, if I could. If the notion is that because Roe has not been overturned in 30 some cases makes it a super precedent, well Plessy had not been overturned in a series of cases over a period of 60 years, where the Court at each time looked at it, discussed it, and decided against overturning it. Yet I do not think anybody would agree that Plessy

290
should not have been overturned, and certainly not anybody from my State. But the notion that by tenure it becomes a super precedent or by number of times that it has been looked at it becomes a super precedent, I do not think finds a basis in law, nor in practicality, as you noted. And some of these decisions up there, I would point out to you, are pretty onerous statements that the Court put forward itself in how they upheld Plessy for a number of years, and yet, thank goodness, that the Court overruled it in the Brown v. Board of Education case that it eventually decided.
I want to also point out to you something you talked a lot about yesterday, and I really appreciate this, that judges decide cases and cases are built on facts, so that while you have the facts and you have the law, the facts matter. There is no one in my State that would not be honored to show you the school building where Brown v. Board of Education was decided. We just dedicated it last year. The President was there, 50th year anniversary. You can see the path where the little girl walked to the school and had to walk by the all-white school to get there. You look at that set of facts and you say, ‘‘That’s wrong,’’ and you’re ennobled that we no longer do that.
I held a hearing earlier this year on the factual setting of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, the factual setting of these two cases. The two plaintiffs in those cases testified in front of the Judiciary Subcommittee. I was there and so was Senator Feingold. Both of the plaintiffs talked about the false statements of record that those cases were built upon. Listen to this statement by Sandra Cano. She’s of Doe v. Bolton. This is what she said, June 23rd, 2005 in the Judiciary Subcommittee that I chaired. Quote: ‘‘Doe v. Bolton falsely created the health exception that led to abortion on demand and partial birth abortion.’’ This is her statement now. ‘‘I, Sandra Cano, only sought legal assistance to get a divorce from my husband and to get my children from foster care. Abortion never crossed my mind, although apparently was on the mind of the attorney from whom I sought help.’’
Further quote: ‘‘At no time did I ever have an abortion, I did not seek an abortion, nor do I believe in abortion.’’ This is Sandra Cano, of Doe v. Bolton.
And then she goes on to say, ‘‘Doe v. Bolton is based on lies and deceit. It needs to be retried or overturned,’’ which she is trying to get it retried. ‘‘It is against my wishes. Abortion is wrong.’’ That is Doe of Doe v. Bolton.
Here is Norma McCorvey, of Roe v. Wade. This is just the factual setting. ‘‘I believe I was used and abused by the court system in America. Instead of helping women in Roe v. Wade, I brought destruction to me and millions of women throughout the Nation.’’ Norma McCorvey.
Quote: ‘‘This is really troubling too. I made up the story that I had been raped to help justify my abortion.’’ Norma McCorvey.
Facts, facts, in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, falsified statements. And upon this we have based this constitutional right that has been found, that we now have 40 million fewer children in the country to bless us with?
I want to take another point on that to you. We have talked a lot about the disability community, and well we should, and the
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00302 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

291
protection needed for the disability community. That is important, because I think it helps people that need help, but it also helps the rest of us to be much more human and caring.
Senator Kennedy is helping me with a bill because a number of children never get here that have disabilities. Unborn children prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome and other disabilities—I do not know if you know this, but there was a recent analysis, and 80 to 90 percent of children prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome never get here. Never get here. They are aborted, and people just say, ‘‘look, this child has difficulties.’’ And we even have waiting lists in America of people today willing to adopt children with Down syndrome.
We will protect that child, as well we should under Americans with Disabilities Act and other issues when they get here. But so much of the time, and with our increased ability of genetic testing, they don’t get here. Diagnosis in the womb, a system that encourages this child to be destroyed at that stage, and this is all in the records. We are the poorer for it as a society.
All the members of this body know a young man with Down syndrome named Jimmy. Maybe you have met him, even. He runs the elevator that takes the Senators up and down on the Senate floors. His warm smile welcomes us every day. We are a better body for him. He frequently gives me a hug in the elevators. I know he does Senator Hatch often, too, who kindly gives him ties, some of which I question the taste of, Orrin, but—
[Laughter.] Senator BROWNBACK.—but he kindly gives ties. Senator HATCH. This doesn’t have to get personal. [Laughter.] Senator BROWNBACK. Jimmy said to me the other day after he hugged me, he said, ‘‘Shhh, don’t tell my supervisor. They’re telling me I’m hugging too many people.’’ And yet we are ennobled by him and what he does and how he lifts up our humanity, and 80 to 90 percent of the kids in this country like Jimmy never get here. What does that do to us? What does that say about us? I would just ask you, Judge Roberts, to consider, and probably you can’t answer here today, whether the individuals with disabilities have the same constitutional rights that you and I share while they are in the womb. Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I appreciate your thoughts on the subject very much. I do think, though, since those precise questions could come before the Court that that is in the area that I have to refrain from answering. Senator BROWNBACK. I hope one thinks about people like Jimmy and a system now that scientifically can figure out the nature of this child’s physical or mental state at an early point and is having many of them destroyed at that point in time. That is taking place in our country today. I have little time left. I want to say one final thing to you, and I appreciate you and I appreciate your inability to answer some of these questions. They are tough questions and they are questions that are live in front of us as a society.

I would just ask you really about your mentor, one of your mentors, Chief Justice Rehnquist, who I admired greatly, admired for his demeanor. As you go on, and I anticipate you will be approved to be the Chief Justice of the United States, I would ask you just if you could briefly respond, how do you view his mentorship of you and your taking over, if you are confirmed, as Chief Justice? What does that mean personally to you and how will it impact you as Chief Justice?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, it makes the opportunity a very special one, as I’ve said before. The Chief was a mentor to many people, and like many great mentors, of course, he led by example, not by precept. His example of how he dealt with other people, not just other Justices but everybody in the courthouse, including the law clerks, in an open, friendly, balanced way was an example for everybody there.
Substantively, his approach to the role of a judge and the appropriate role of the Court is, I think, a very important example. He was somebody who appreciated the limits, the appropriate limits on the judicial role and the judicial power, and he was always careful and conscious of that. He was always asking whether or not this was something that it was appropriate for the courts to do.
I do think it’s important for judges at every level to always ask that question, because as we had talked earlier, judicial self-restraint is the key check on the authority of the court, and if you’re not asking yourself that question at every stage, is this an appropriate thing for me to do as a judge, then there’s a great danger that you’ll lose sight of that important judicial self-restraint.
Senator BROWNBACK. God bless you, your service to the country, and your family.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Brownback. Senator Leahy has a doctor’s appointment this morning but will be joining us shortly. We now turn to Senator Coburn for his 30 minutes. Senator COBURN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and again, welcome. Good morning. Judge ROBERTS. Good morning. Senator COBURN. There were so many legal terms yesterday bandied around that I was having trouble grabbing hold of, I thought I would start out with medical terms this morning and see if you could keep up. [Laughter.] Senator COBURN. I also thought it was interesting, since you have been prophesied to have 35 years, that is 12,675 days, that the Chairman prophesies that you will be there. You have passed three of them, and congratulations on number three. I want to go to something that Senator Kyl talked with you about, and I was very pleased with your answer. He asked you about referencing and using preference to select and pick precedents from foreign law yesterday. I thought you gave a very reassuring answer to the American public. You based your answer on two points. One is that the democratic theory is that in this country, with our law, the people are involved in that, both through the Senate, the House, and the President who
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00304 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

293
appoints you. The other point you made is that relying on foreign precedent does not confine judges.
I just want to kind of ask a couple of questions. Number one, the oath that you took for your appellate position and the oath that you will take states the following, that I, John Roberts, do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me, John Roberts, under the Constitution and the laws of the United States, so help me, God.
My question relates to the Constitution and what is said in Article III, that judges both of the Supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices during good behavior. My question to you is, relying on foreign precedent and selecting and choosing a foreign precedent to create a bias outside of the laws of this country, is that good behavior?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I—for the reasons I stated yesterday, I don’t think it’s a good approach. I wouldn’t accuse judges or Justices who disagree with that, though, of violating their oath. I’d accuse them of getting it wrong on that point, and I’d hope to sit down with them and debate it and reason about it.
I think that Justices who reach a contrary result on those questions are operating in good faith and trying, as I do on the court I am on now, to live up to that oath that you read. I wouldn’t want to suggest that they’re not doing that. Again, I would think they’re not getting it right in that particular case and with that particular approach and would hope to be able to sit down and argue with it, as I suspect they’d like to sit down and debate with me. But I wouldn’t suggest they’re not operating in good faith to comply with—
Senator COBURN. Can the American people count on you to not use foreign precedent in your decision making on the Supreme Court?
Judge ROBERTS. You know, I will follow the Supreme Court’s precedents consistent with the principles of stare decisis, and there are cases in this area, of course. That’s why we’re having the debate. The Court has looked at those. I think it’s fair to say, in the prior opinions, those are not determinative in the sense that the precedent turned entirely on foreign law, so it’s not a question of whether or not you’d be departing from these cases if you decided not to use foreign law. For the reasons I gave yesterday, I’m going to be looking—
Senator COBURN. I understand that, and I respect that and I know that you can’t be in a position to make a judgment on that. But again, for the record, I want to read what the Constitution says, that judges both of the Supreme and inferior courts shall hold their offices during good behavior and that the oath that they take references only the Constitution and the laws of this country. If anything, I would like to send a message that that is what their oath says and this judicial restraint that you have spoken of, I believe includes that oath and the definition that our Founders believed when they said, here is what you should base your decisions on, is the Constitution of the United States and the laws.

The other thing, yesterday, you had an exchange with Senator Feingold on a case, and I think it was the Gonzaga case. You talked about congressional intent. I would like you for a moment to spend a minute giving us your opinion, and you may refuse to do so if you care to, that would be your privilege, but one of my observations is that oftentimes, we don’t do a very good job with the laws that we write because we are not very clear. Sometimes we are lazy. Sometimes we are politically expedient. But oftentimes, the very problems that you as a Court make controversial decisions over are because we have not done a good job.
I would just like your thoughts as to if you were to critique things that we could do better to make your job easier and clearer, what would you have to say to that?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, sitting where I am, I am not terribly inclined to be critical of the Congress—
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS.—and wouldn’t be in any event. But a lot of what judges spend their time doing, not always in the momentous constitutional cases that we’ve been talking about, but sometimes in very mundane cases, is the effort to discern congressional intent, trying to figure out what Congress meant when it used specific words that were passed by both Houses and signed by the President into law. Now, some of that is entirely unavoidable. The complexity of human endeavor is such that situations are going to arise that are not clearly answered by even the most specific language, and that’s to be expected and judges have to address those situations. But as you suggest yourself in your question, there are situations where sometimes Congress punts the issue to the courts. They can’t come to an agreement about how a particular provision should be applied, and so folks who wanted to go one way and folks who wanted to go the other way just sort of leave it ambiguous or leave it out and take their chances in court. Obviously, that’s a different situation. I think all judges would tell you that to the extent Congress can address the issues and resolve the issues that are the policy questions entrusted to them, it makes it a lot easier for the courts to decide the cases that do come up because then it’s just a question of looking at the facts and the law is clear and you apply the facts to the law. If the law is unclear, that makes it that much more difficult. As I said, obviously, a lot of these situations are unavoidable, but there are certainly—and the Supreme Court has addressed many of these, the issue of implied rights of action in the past, and they were doing case after case after case and they finally adopted an approach in the early 1980s that said, look, we’re not going to imply rights of action anymore. Congress, if you want somebody to have a right of action, just say so. But this is not a good thing for the courts to be doing, deciding whether a particular right of action should be implied or not. And after the Court developed that jurisprudence in the early 1980s, the hope was, and I think it has been realized to a large extent, that there will be more addressing of that question in Congress, which is where it should be addressed. Senator COBURN. And you would agree, we could do a better job?

Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’m sure everyone is doing as good a job as they can—
Senator COBURN. That is the first answer I worry about that you given through the whole testimony.
[Laughter.] Senator COBURN. Let me go to another area. As I mentioned in my opening statement, I am a practicing physician, kind of an oldtime GP. I have delivered 4,000 babies. I take care of people at the end of life, at the beginning of life. In all 50 States, death is recognized and defined as the irreversible cessation of the brain and heart activity. Do you have any reason to dispute that? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t know the medical terms or definitions, but no. I mean, if that’s the law in the States—that’s not to say that it has any particular legal significance in cases— Senator COBURN. Right. I am not asking you about legal significance. Would you agree that the opposite of being dead is being alive? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Again— [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I don’t mean to be overly cautious in answering— Senator COBURN. You know I am going somewhere. [Laughter.] Senator COBURN. One of the problems I have is coming up with just the common sense and logic that if brain waves and heartbeat signifies life, the absence of them signifies death, then the presence of them certainly signifies life. And to say otherwise logically is schizophrenic, and that is how I view a lot of the decisions that have come from the Supreme Court on the issue of abortion. I won’t press you on this issue. I know you can’t. But for the listeners of this hearing, if, in fact, life is the presence of a heartbeat and brain waves, it is important for everybody in the country to know that at 16 days post-conception, a heartbeat is present, and that at 41 days, right now, we can assure ourselves that brain activity and brain waves are present. And as the technology improves, we are going to see that come earlier and earlier. I make that point because so many of the decisions of the Supreme Court have been made in a vacuum of the scientific knowledge of what life is, when personhood is, when it begins, when it doesn’t, when it exists, when it doesn’t, and it belies the scientific facts and medical facts that are out there today, and so that was for your information and my ability to put forth a philosophy that I believe would solve a lot of the controversy in this country. I want to cover one area that was discussed yesterday where the implication was made that you might have ruled on a case violating a judicial ethic, and that was the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld case. Senator Feingold asked you questions about the case. You invoked the cannon, the code of conduct of U.S. judges that prohibits you from talking about a pending case. I would like, Mr. Chairman, a copy of that canon to be placed in the record. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, so ordered. Senator COBURN. Canon 3 provides that a judge should perform the duties of the office impartially and diligently. The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all other activities. In per-
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00307 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

296
forming the duties prescribed by law, the judge should adhere to the following standards.
Adjudicative responsibilities—there is another one of those legal words I am having trouble getting my hands around. A judge should avoid public comment on the merits of a pending or impending action requiring similar restraint by court personnel subject to the judge’s direction and control. The official commentary to Canon 3(a)(6) provides the admonition against public comment about the merits of a pending or impending action until completion of the appellate process.
I would also note that any criticism of your participation in this case is unwarranted. Numerous law professors who specialize in legal ethics have stated that you in no way have violated any ethics rules simply because you were considered for another judgeship. The opinion was finalized well before you met with the President— I believe that is correct—or was offered this nomination. Is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator COBURN. The argument, the initial vote, and the drafting of the opinion all took place before there was a Supreme Court vacancy at all, is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator COBURN. You did not write an opinion on that case, is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. I joined Judge Randolph’s opinion. Senator COBURN. Right, but you did not write a separate opinion on that case? Judge ROBERTS. No. Senator COBURN. And I would like to also enter into the record the nonpartisan ethicists who agree that Judge Roberts did not violate any ethics rules— Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Senator COBURN. I want to go to one other area that I have some concern about. I know my concerns are opposite from some of those who have a different philosophy of life. Many of the questions posed to you have focused on our concerns about an activist judiciary. My opening statement expressed some of those concerns. However, I am equally concerned about an activist Congress that goes beyond its bounds, a Congress that routinely ignores its own constitutional boundaries. Historically the debate about the role and scope of Congress has focused on the General Welfare clause. As we all know, Article I, section 8, clause 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. The Tenth Amendment also spells out limitations on congressional power. We had the discussion yesterday on the toad, I believe. The Tenth Amendment states the power not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people. I want to give you a quote that James Madison said, because in his wisdom he anticipated that we would try to stretch the definition of the Founders. And he wrote with respect to the words ‘‘General Welfare:’’ I have always regarded them as qualified by the de-

tail of powers connected with them. To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character in which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its Creators.
In Federalist Paper 45, Madison writes: ‘‘The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the Federal Government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments are numerous and infinite.’’
Do you agree with James Madison’s interpretation of the General Welfare Clause, that the powers of the Congress should be fundamentally limited, or do you agree with the modern prevailing wisdom of both political parties, particularly appropriators, who believe Congress’s role is fundamentally unlimited?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I agree with Madison’s view in general that the Constitution does contain limitations on the Federal authority. The General Welfare Clause, and in particular the necessary and proper clause, of course, would have been interpreted in many of Chief Justice John Marshall’s early opinions to recognize though that the scope of authority given to Congress is broad, and broad enough to confront the problems that in Chief Justice John Marshall’s case were confronted by a young Nation and helped to bind it together as a Nation and broad enough today to confront the problems that Congress addresses. But the notion that the Constitution was one of limited powers, albeit broad, under the Necessary and Proper Clause and even the General Welfare Clause is interpreted by Chief Justice John Marshall in these early opinions, that recognition doesn’t undermine the Framers’ essential vision that we are dealing with a Federal system in which vast powers reside with the States, and that the Federal Government is one of limited powers, broad in obviously particular areas and broad under the Necessary and Proper Clause, but limited powers nonetheless.
Senator COBURN. Thank you. I just have one other comment. As you have been before our Committee, I have tried to use my medical skills of observation of body language to ascertain your uncomfortableness and ill at ease with questions and responses. And I have honed that over about 23, 24 years. And the other thing that I believe is, is integrity is at the basis of what we want in judges.
I will tell you that I am very pleased, both in my observational capabilities as a physician to know that your answers have been honest and forthright, as I watch the rest of your body respond to the stress that you are under. But I am also pleased with our President, that he has had the wisdom to pick somebody of such stature and such integrity. Without integrity, what you say here means nothing, and that is the very foundation at which I believe you have based your life, and I am pleased to have you before us, and I thank you.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. Judge Roberts, before taking up the subject of the confrontation—we now proceed to the 20-minute round for each Senator. Before taking up the issue of the confrontation and clash between the

Congress and the Supreme Court, I want to pick up a few strands from yesterday’s testimony.
Near the end of my questioning I had commented on the case of United States v. Dickerson where the Chief Justice had made a modification of his earlier objections to Miranda and said that the Miranda warnings ought to be upheld, contrasting his view in 1974 in a Supreme Court decision with his view in the year 2000, saying that Miranda should not be overruled because it has been embedded in routine police practices and become a part of our national culture, and that has all of the earmarks of a doctrine of a living Constitution.
Dissenting in Poe v. Ullman, Justice John Marshall Harlan made one of the famous statements on this issue, saying that the—commenting on liberty, quote, ‘‘The traditions from which it is developed,’’ that tradition is a living thing. My question to you is, do you regard the evolution of various interpretations on liberty as a living thing, as Justice Harlan did and as Justice Rehnquist appeared to on the Miranda issue?
Judge ROBERTS. I think the Framers, when they used broad language like ‘‘liberty,’’ like ‘‘due process,’’ like ‘‘unreasonable’’ with respect to searches and seizures, they were crafting a document that they intended to apply in a meaningful way down the ages. As they said in the preamble, it was designed to secure the blessings of liberty for their posterity, they intended it to apply to changing conditions, and I think that in that sense it is a concept that is alive in the sense that it applies and they intended it to apply in a particular way, but they intended it to apply down through the ages.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, when you talk about intent, I think that is a pretty tough interpretation. When the Equal Protection Clause was passed by the Senate in 1868, the Senate galleries were segregated, blacks on one side and whites on the other. So that could not have been their intent. The interpretation which occurs later really is captured by Justice Cardozo in the case of Palco v. Connecticut, a case which impressed me enormously back in the law school days, when talking about the constitutional evolution referred to it as expressing values which are, ‘‘the very essence of a scheme of order to liberty,’’ ‘‘principles of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.’’ Would you agree with the Cardozo statement of jurisprudence which I just quoted?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the general approach of recognizing the values that inform the interpretation of the Constitution, it applies to modern times. But just to take the example that you gave of the Equal Protection Clause. The Framers choose broad terms of broad applicability, and they state a broad principle, and the fact that it may have been inconsistent with their practice may have meant that they were adopting a broad principle that was inconsistent with their practice, and their practices would have to change, as they did, with respect to segregation in the Senate galleries, with respect to segregation in other areas.
But when they adopt broad terms and broad principles, we should hold them to their word, and imply them consistent with those terms and those principles. And that means when they have adopted principles like liberty, that doesn’t get a crabbed or narrow

299
construction. It is a broad principle that should be applied consistent with their intent, which was to adopt a broad principle.
I depart from some views of original intent in the sense that those folks, some people view it as meaning just the conditions at that time, just the particular problem. I think you need to look at the words they used, and if the words adopt a broader principle, it applies more broadly.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, I will accept that as an indication of your view not to have a ‘‘crabbed interpretation’’ and applying the broad principles.
Let me refer you to a statement by Chief Justice Rehnquist in dissent in the Casey case, which surprises me. I ask you whether you agree with this. He said, ‘‘A woman’s interest in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.’’ Do you agree with that?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that does get into an area where cases are coming up. The Chief in that position was referencing of course the holding in Roe v. Wade, and that was what the issue was in Casey. But I don’t think I should opine on the correctness or incorrectness of particular views in areas that are likely to come before the Court.
Chairman SPECTER. I am going to move now to the confrontation between Congress and the Court, and what I consider to be denigrating comments about the Congress. In the Morrison case, in the face of a overwhelming factual record, the Court, 5–4 decision, said that parts of the legislation to protect women against violence unconstitutional because of the congressional ‘‘method of reasoning.’’ And then the dissent picked up the conclusion that the majority’s view was ‘‘dependent upon a uniquely judicial competence’’ with the other side of the coin being congressional incompetence. And then in the dissent in Tennessee v. Lane Justice Scalia says that the Court engaged in ill-advised proceedings to make itself the ‘‘task master’’ to see if the Congress has done its homework. You commented a few minutes ago that you would be respectful of Congress. Do we have your commitment that you won’t characterize your method of reasoning as superior to ours?
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t think it’s appropriate— Chairman SPECTER. In your particular case, maybe yours is, but— Judge ROBERTS. No, no. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. As a generalization—we have gone around this with other nominees, and after they have gone to the Court, they have not been mindful as to what they have said here. But I take umbrage at what the Court has said and so do my colleagues. There isn’t a method of reasoning which changes when you move across the green from the Senate columns to the Supreme Court columns. And we do our homework, evidenced by what has gone on in this hearing, and we do not like being treated as schoolchildren, requiring, as Justice Scalia says, a task master. Will you do better on this subject, Judge Roberts? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t think the Court should be the task master of Congress. I think the Constitution is the Court’s task master, and it’s Congress’s task master as well. And we each have

responsibilities under the Constitution. And I appreciate very much the differences in institutional competence between the judiciary and the Congress when it comes to basic questions of fact finding, development of a record, and also the authority to make the policy decisions about how to act on the basis of a particular record. It’s not just disagreement over a record. It’s a question of whose job it is to make a determination based on the record. Now—
Chairman SPECTER. On the record. In U.S. v. Morrison, the legislation to protect women against violence, the record showed that there were reporters on gender bias from the task force in 21 States and eight separate reports issued by Congress and its committees over a long course of time leading to the enactment and the characterization by the dissenters that there was a mountain of evidence.
What more does the Congress have to do to establish a record that will be respected by the Court? And this is where the five-person majority threw it over, not because of the record but because of the method of reasoning. Isn’t that record palpably sufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the Act?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don’t want to comment on the correctness of incorrectness of a particular decision. What I will say—
Chairman SPECTER. Well, Judge Roberts, let me interrupt you there for a minute. Why not? The case is over. This isn’t a case which is likely to come before you again. These are the specific facts based on the rape of the woman—alleged rape by the three VMI students. I liked your answers yesterday. You were willing to answer more questions about cases on the differentiation that they are not likely to come before the Court. This is not likely to come before the Court again. Isn’t this record sufficient in Morrison to—
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I must respectfully disagree. I have been willing to comment on cases that I think are not likely to come before the Court again. I think the particular question you ask about the adequacy of findings, make a determination of the impact on interstate commerce, is likely to come before the Court again. And expressing an opinion on whether the Morrison case was correct or incorrect would be prejudging those cases that are likely to come before the Court again. And that is the line— it’s not just a line that I’m drawing. It’s a line that, as I’ve read the transcripts, every nominee who’s sitting on the Court today drew. Some of them drew the line far more aggressively and wouldn’t even comment on cases like Marbury v. Madison.
What I can tell you is that with respect to review of congressional findings, that my view of the appropriate role of a judge is a limited role and that you do not make the law, and that it seems to me that one of the warning flags that should suggest to you as a judge that you may be beginning to transgress into the area of making a law is when you are in a position of re-evaluating legislative findings, because that doesn’t look like a judicial function. It’s not an application of analysis under the Constitution. It’s just another look at findings.
Now, again, I don’t feel it’s appropriate to comment on Morrison. I do feel it’s appropriate to tell you that I appreciate the differences between Congress and the courts with respect to findings, both

301
with respect to the issue of the capability and competence to undertake that enterprise, and also with respect to the issue of authority to make a decision based on the findings.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Roberts, we will have to agree to disagree about that. I don’t think the facts of Morrison are likely to come before the Court, but I ask the questions, you answer them.
Let me come now to the Americans with Disabilities Act, and you have 5–4 decisions going opposite ways. Ms. Garrett had breast cancer. The Court in 2001 said that the title of the Disabilities Act was unconstitutional, 5–4, on employment discrimination. Then 3 years later, you have the case coming up of Lane, the paraplegic crawling up the steps, accommodations, 5–4, and the Act is upheld. The record in the case was very extensive—13 congressional hearings, a task force that held hearings in every State, attended by more than 30,000 people, including thousands who had experienced discrimination. And in the Garrett case, the Supreme Court of the United States used a doctrine which had been in vogue only since 1997 in the Boerne case. You and I discussed this in my office. They came up with a standard of what is congruent and proportionate. Congruence and proportionality.
I was interested in your statement when we talked informally that you did not find those in the 14th Amendment. I did not either. Now, they plucked congruence and proportionality right out of thin air, and when Scalia dissented, he said that the congruence and proportionality test was a ‘‘flabby test,’’ which is a ‘‘invitation to judicial arbitrariness by policy-driven decisionmaking.’’
Now, you said yesterday that you did not think that there was judicial activism when the Court overruled an Act of Congress. Isn’t this congruence and proportionality test, which comes out of thin air, a classic example of judicial activism where the view of congruence—hard to find a definition for congruence. Proportionality, hard to find a definition for proportionality. I have searched and cannot find any.
Isn’t that the very essence of what is in the eye of the beholder where the Court takes carte blanche to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, these questions arise, of course, under, as you know, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, where the issue is Congress’s power to address violations of the 14th Amendment. And it’s an extraordinary grant of power, and the Court has always recognized it as such. And their decisions in recent years—it’s not just, as you point out, the Garrett case on the one hand and the Lane case on the other. You have the Hibbs case recently, which upheld Congress’s exercise of authority. The most recent cases— Lane and Hibbs—uphold Congress’s exercise of authority to abrogate—
Chairman SPECTER. But, Judge Roberts, they uphold it at the pleasure of the Court. Congress can’t figure that out. There is no way we can tell what is congruent and proportional in the eyes of the Court.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, and that was Justice Scalia’s position in dissent. He had originally—
Chairman SPECTER. Do you agree with Scalia?

302
Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, the congruent and proportional test—
Chairman SPECTER. Do you disagree with Justice Scalia? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t think it’s appropriate in an area—and there are cases coming up, as you know, Mr. Chairman. There’s a case on the docket right now that considers the congruence and proportionality test. Chairman SPECTER. That is why I am raising it with you. I would like to see a sensible interpretation of the Court in that case. Judge ROBERTS. Well, and if I am confirmed and I do have to sit on that case, I would approach that with an open mind and consider the arguments. I can’t give you a commitment here today about how I will approach an issue that is going to be on the docket within a matter of months. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Roberts, I am not talking about an issue. I am talking about the essence of jurisprudence. I am talking about the essence of a man/woman-made test in the Supreme Court which has no grounding in the Constitution, no grounding in the Federalist Papers, no grounding in the history of the country, comes out of thin air in 1997, and it is used in Lane and Garrett, two 5–4 decisions on identical records, on an identical Act, and the country and the Congress are supposed to figure out what the Court means. So I am really talking about jurisprudence. Judge Roberts, let me move to one other subject in the 2 minutes that I have remaining, and that is, on the ability which you would have, if confirmed as Chief Justice, to try to bring a consensus to the Court. We have 5–4 decisions as the hallmark of the Courts. Not unusual. You commented yesterday about what Chief Justice Warren did on Brown v. Board of Education, taking a very disparate Court and pulling the Court together. As you and I discussed in my office, there are an overwhelming number of cases where there are multiple concurrences. A writes of concurring opinion in which B joins; then B writes a concurring opinion in which A joins and C joins. In reading the trilogy of cases on detainees from June of 2004 to figure out what we ought to do about Guantanamo, it was a patchwork of confusion. I was intrigued by the comment which you made in our meeting about a dialogue among equals, and you characterized that as a dialogue among equals when you appear before the Court, and they are on a little different level over there. I am way behind you on Supreme Court arguments. It is 39–3. But I would have been an equal of theirs in any event. Perhaps you are. But I am intrigued by your concept, and I asked you how you would be able to be the Chief with Justice Scalia, who is 18 years older than you, and even Justice Thomas, who is 7 years older than you. Tell us what you think you can do on this dialogue among equals to try to bring some consensus to the Court to try to avoid this proliferation of opinions and avoid all these 5–4 decisions. My time is up. Senator LEAHY. I would like to hear the answer because that is a question I was going to ask, too. Chairman SPECTER. Well, now we are on Senator Leahy’s time. Go ahead. Senator LEAHY. Oh, no, we are not on my time.

303
[Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. We are not on my time. We are still on yours, Mr. Chairman. But I would like to hear this answer. Chairman SPECTER. It is permissible to have the answer on the red light, just not the question. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t want to be presumptuous about if I am confirmed, what I would do. I do think, though, it’s a responsibility of all of the Justices, not just the Chief Justice, to try to work toward an opinion of the Court. The Supreme Court speaks only as a Court. Individually, the Justices have no authority. And I do think it should be a priority to have an opinion of the Court. You don’t obviously compromise strongly held views, but you do have to be open to the considered views of your colleagues, particularly when it gets to a concurring opinion. I do think you do need to ask yourself, what benefit is this serving? Why is it necessary for me to state this separate reason? Can I go take another look at what the four of them think or the three of them think to see if I can subscribe to that or get them to modify it in a way that would allow me to subscribe to that, because an important function of the Supreme Court is to provide guidance. As a lower court judge, I appreciate clear guidance from the Supreme Court. I know the last thing Chief Justice Rehnquist said in Court, on the last day of the term he was reading the disposition in a case and said, you know, A reaches this conclusion, is joined by B, and then C has a separate concurrence joined by D and E, and he ended up by saying, ‘‘I didn’t know we had that many Judges on the Court.’’ That undermines the importance of providing guidance. I do think the Chief Justice has a particular obligation to try to achieve consensus consistent with everyone’s individual oath to uphold the Constitution, and that would certainly be a priority for me if I were confirmed. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Roberts. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for asking that question because it was one I wanted to ask, too. Last night, we welcomed you to night court. Welcome to daytime court. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Senator LEAHY. It will probably become night court before we get done. [Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. We talked just briefly about the First Amendment yesterday. It is written primarily in terms of speech, but in a free and democratic nation, access to information, I think, is extraordinarily important. Our Framers, surely understood the ancient maxim, ‘‘knowledge is power.’’ Actually, that was the maxim the administration used as the model for what was a somewhat Orwellian Total Information Awareness program until a Republican Congress, and I supported this, shut it down. It was asking too much knowledge about individual Americans. I also spoke about ‘‘we the people.’’ If ‘‘we the people’’ know what our government is doing and why it is doing it, we can hold the government accountable, and should. So while I am not going to go

into a specific case, I worry about an administration that spreads misinformation and declares more things secret, spending billions of dollars doing so, far more than any administration in history— probably than all administrations put together. It punishes the whistleblowers. It bars the press and cameras from so many different events.
And I believe very strongly that if the people want to know what is going on, the courts are, if at all possible, supposed to take their side in making sure they know what is going on, because our government should not be able to hide things unnecessarily from the people. No matter who is in power, the people should know what is going on.
So I would like to know how you would approach such a case. Let me give you a few examples in the last couple of years. The administration fought to prevent the media from covering coffins returning from Iraq. It fought to keep disturbing images of U.S.run prisons in Iraq from the media. And just last weekend, actually after a loss in court, the administration abandoned its zero-access policy regarding the scenes of devastation in New Orleans. As you know, most of America found out what was going on in New Orleans from the press, not from our government, at least in the first few days.
There have been a number of reasons, excuses, which seem to change day by day for why these things are being blocked. I am not going to ask you to evaluate them, but my question is this.
If the government seeks broadly to exclude media from access to images or events of public interest or concern, does the First Amendment require the government to justify that denial of access, and if so, applying what kind of standards? Not any particular case, but what kind of standards does the Court have to apply?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I haven’t dealt with a lot of First Amendment access cases. I know I studied one about media access to prisons, for example, the issue about whether the media had a right of access to prisons if they wanted to report on it. So I am not terribly familiar with the precise levels of scrutiny that apply.
There is, obviously, a balancing of sorts between particular interests when you are dealing with governmental operations and there are some perfectly valid reasons for excluding media. On the other hand, simply disagreement about whether it’s an appropriate issue for the public to see would not strike me as a very compelling governmental interest, and I think the courts regularly balance these sorts of things when they get an issue about a challenge by the media saying their First Amendment rights are being violated because of a particular exclusion.
Again, I’m not terribly familiar with the precise legal standards or how they’ve developed since the prison access case that I’m familiar with, but it does require a consideration and weighing, and the values of the First Amendment obviously are something that have to be given careful weight by the court for the very reasons that you have discussed, because the First Amendment is—it serves a purpose. It’s not there just because the Framers thought this was in general a good idea. It serves a purpose with respect to the government. It provides access to information and allows

305
people in a free society to make a judgment about what their government is up to.
Senator LEAHY. Like the Chairman, I was a prosecutor, and if we move a little bit out of the prison situation, which raises all other kinds of questions related to the ability to limit access, let’s just go to something that the public might easily have access to if they could just walk in there.
Suppose the government—I will use something like Katrina. Suppose they felt that the rescue operations of the government, whether it is State, local, or Federal, was being handled in an inept way or evacuees were being mistreated. Does that give the government a right to bar the media who may want to expose that?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think as a general— Senator LEAHY. How would you analyze the claim, without citing a particular case, how would you analyze it? The media comes and says, look, the government screwed up and we are trying to get in there to take pictures to show how they screwed up and they say we can’t come in. How would you analyze a claim like that? Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, I do start with a general principle in this area, and I think it was Justice Brandeis who talked about sunlight being the best disinfectant— Senator LEAHY. Disinfectant. Judge ROBERTS.—and I think that’s a lot of what the Framers had in mind in guaranteeing freedom of speech and the other rights that go along with it. They appreciated the benefits that would come from public awareness. That’s an important principle. I also, and again, this is not an area that I feel completely up to speed on the precedents, and I obviously, if I were in a position as a judge and had to decide a particular case, would study them and become aware, but my recollection is that there is great difficulty whenever you try to distinguish between public rights and media rights and that if it’s a situation in which the public is being given access, you can’t discriminate against the media and say, as a general matter, that the media don’t have access because their access rights, of course, correspond with those of the public. And as you said, they’re in a position—if there are a handful of people who might be able to have access, the media is in a position to make that information or knowledge, whatever, available on a broader basis and— Senator LEAHY. I raise this not because I am trying to pin you down on a particular case. I think we are going to see more and more of this. We are in the digital age. A lot of information is readily available. At the same time, the bad part about that is our government can acquire more and more and more information on us, just as your credit card company or anybody else does on you. Some of us want to be in a position to be able to go in and find out what is being collected on us. To what extent are we giving up our privacy? Usually, far more than the Congress or anybody else, it has been the media that has exposed when this has been overdone, when mistakes or violations have been made, and I would hope that you would be committed to protecting just as much access as possible rather than the other way around.

Let me go to an issue we discussed yesterday, or others did, the issue of capital punishment. We have held in this Committee a number of hearings that show some real flaws in the administration of capital punishment; sleeping lawyers, drunk lawyers, lawyers who didn’t bother even to investigate or didn’t have the funds to do it. More than 100 death row inmates have been exonerated, including some, though, who spent years on death row in the most horrible conditions for a crime they never committed.
I think Senator Durbin mentioned the situation out in Illinois where a Republican Governor had to, and did, courageously, I thought, extend clemency to a whole lot of people who had been on death row. Some say, and I think you have even said this, when people are exonerated, it shows the system works. Well, let me tell you about the system in that case.
One of the people was Anthony Porter. He spent 16 years on death row. He came within 2 days of being executed. The system didn’t work on his behalf. A bunch of kids from Northwestern University had taken an elective course on journalism, and the teacher said, why don’t you look into this case, and these kids went out and did it. The kids dug up the information that was there, available to the police, available to the prosecutor, available to the Feds. Nobody before had dug it up. They found it, and the State’s Attorney dropped the case. They got somebody else to confess.
You said 2 years ago, and I remember being at that hearing, you said about the startling number of innocent men sentenced to death who were later exonerated, that it somehow showed the system worked in exonerating them.
I worry about that statement. I really do. It has bothered me— and, you know, I voted for you for the circuit court and it was a split vote in our party. But that one really bothered me, that statement. I found it almost mechanical, and I will tell you why.
While people may say the fact that innocent people have been freed after years on death row shows the system is working, it doesn’t. I think Sandra Day O’Connor said a few years ago, if statistics are any indication, the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed. If that is the case, the system is not working.
Herrera, we discussed that. The court grappled with, but didn’t ultimately decide, whether the Constitution permits the execution of a person who is innocent. As principal Deputy Solicitor General, you co-authored the amicus brief for the U.S. in the Herrera case. You said the claim of innocence does not state a ground for Federal habeas. Actually, you said, quote, ‘‘Does the Constitution require that a prisoner have the right to seek judicial review of a claim of newly discovered evidence instead of being required to seek relief in the clemency process? In our view, the Constitution does not guarantee the prisoner such a right.’’
So let me ask you this. Without going into the facts of Herrera, is it your current personal view that the death row inmate who can prove his innocence has no constitutional right to do so before a court before he is executed?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, and this is the basis of the disagreement in Herrera. Herrera was not a case about actual inno-

cence. It’s a question of whether you’re entitled to bring a new claim—
Senator LEAHY. But listen to my question. Is a death row inmate who can prove his innocence, they have no constitutional right to do so in a court of law before they are executed?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, prove his innocence. The issue arrives before you get to the question of proof and the question is, do you allow someone who has raised several claims over the years to suddenly say at the last minute, somebody who just died was the person who committed the murder, and does that mean you start the trial all over again simply on the basis of that last-minute claim, or do you require more of a showing at that stage? That’s what Herrera was about.
Now, I don’t think, of course, that anybody who is innocent should be—suffer as a result of a false conviction. If they’ve been falsely convicted and they’re innocent, they shouldn’t be—
Senator LEAHY. Well, does the— Judge ROBERTS.—in prison, let alone executed. Senator LEAHY. But does the Constitution permit the execution of an innocent person? Judge ROBERTS. I would think not, but the question is never do you allow the execution of an innocent person. The question is, do you allow particular claimants to raise different claims a fourth or fifth or sixth time, to say at the last minute, somebody who just died was actually the person who committed the murder. Let’s have a new trial. Or do you take into account the proceedings that have already gone on. Senator LEAHY. I am looking for broad principles here. You said—let me read it again—‘‘does the Constitution require that a prisoner have the right to seek judicial review of a claim of newly discovered evidence instead of being required to seek relief in the clemency process? In our view, the Constitution does not guarantee the prisoner such a right.’’ Is that your view today? Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s what the Court held in Herrera— Senator LEAHY. Is that your view today? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’m not in a position to comment on the correctness or incorrectness of particular Court decisions. That’s the Court’s precedent in Herrera. It agreed with the administration position, which was not that innocent people should be subject to imprisonment or execution— Senator LEAHY. That is the position you took. The Supreme Court is going to revisit this issue in House v. Bell. Because you stated a position on that, does that require you to recuse yourself in House v. Bell? Judge ROBERTS. No, because the position was stated in a brief filed on behalf of the administration and we talked yesterday about the established principle that lawyers do not subscribe as a personal matter to the views they present on behalf of clients. Senator LEAHY. Well, in this case, the client is the United States. I mean, you are stating the position as sort of the, what do they call it, the Tenth Justice. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I was the Deputy Solicitor General on the brief. I didn’t argue the case. The Solicitor General was the counsel

308
of record in the case. But the position presented in the brief as an advocate is not necessarily the position of every lawyer on the brief.
Senator LEAHY. I think you were more than just a lawyer on a brief. You were in one of the most sought-after jobs, picked because of your positions. I was very impressed when I talked with you about your use of Latin, for example, and French, and I am always impressed by somebody with that facility. There is a Latin phrase—and this is not a ‘‘gotcha.’’ I will translate it: ‘‘Qui facit per alium facit per se.’’ He who acts through another acts for himself. And that is not the case in Herrera?
Judge ROBERTS. He who acts for another acts for himself? Well, it’s the client acting through the lawyer. And it’s the client who’s acting for themselves.
Senator LEAHY. You are the client in this case—the Solicitor General is the client, in effect.
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, I disagree with that. Senator LEAHY. Okay. Judge ROBERTS. The Solicitor General represents the interests of the United States, and those positions represent that client’s position. In the Herrera case, again, it was the Solicitor General who was responsible for the position that was advanced. I’m not suggesting in any way that I disagree with it or agree with it. I’m just saying that it is a basic principle in our system that lawyers represent clients, and you do not ascribe the position of the client to the lawyer. It’s a position that goes back to John Adams and the Revolution. Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you this, then. Let me ask you something that can be ascribed to a Justice of the Supreme Court, and it is something that both the Chairman and I have talked a lot about, and that goes to some of the mechanics. If you will let me take a moment to explain for the audience the so-called rule of four. It takes only four Justices to grant cert, but it takes five to grant a stay of execution. Usually the courtesy is that if you get four, a fifth one will sign on. That has not always been followed of late. Of course, we are dealing with life or death, and Senator Specter has called it a bizarre and unacceptable outcome and once introduced legislation to change it. How would you feel, if you were Chief, and you had four—four of the Justices now voted for a stay of execution, do you feel as Chief you would do the courtesy of kicking in the fifth one? Judge ROBERTS. It’s an issue that I’m familiar with. I do know it arose. And I thought the common practice, the current practice was that if there are four votes to grant cert that the Court would grant the stay, even though that does require the fifth vote, so that you don’t have a situation— Senator LEAHY. Yes, but that is because one more says, okay, we got four— Judge ROBERTS. Right. Senator LEAHY.—we will put somebody else’s name on here. But that hasn’t been followed all the time recently. It usually was, and that is why both Senator Specter and I have raised concern. Do you feel the earlier practice of once you have four— Judge ROBERTS. I think that practice makes a lot of sense. I don’t want to commit to pursue a particular practice in an area that I’ll

309
obviously have to look at in the future, but it obviously makes great sense that if you have four to grant and that’s the rule that you will consider an issue if there are four to grant. You don’t want to moot the case by not staying the sentence.
Senator LEAHY. And I appreciate that because I know we find a lot of cases where they are perfectly willing to grant cert on monetary damages, but here you can’t get it right, it doesn’t make much difference on appeal after the execution.
You wrote a memo back in 1983, as a White House lawyer, regarding proposals by then-Chief Justice Warren Burger to reduce the Supreme Court’s caseload. In that memo, you volunteered the following: ‘‘If the Justices truly think they are overworked, the cure lies close at hand. For example, giving coherence to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence by adopting the good-faith standard and advocating the role of fourth or fifth guesser in death penalty cases would eliminate about a half dozen argued cases from the Court’s docket each term.’’
Are you saying that judges are just too busy to pay attention to death cases?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator. Senator LEAHY. What are you saying? How do you feel today? That was 1983. How do you feel now 22 years later? Judge ROBERTS. Well, in 1983, of course, they were hearing about 150 cases a year. They hear about half that now. Again, I don’t want to prejudge questions or even be presumptuous to look down the road, but it seems to me that there’s the capability there to hear more cases today, not fewer. And I’m sure there are reasons for the reduction in the caseload that I’m not familiar with that I might become more familiar with, but they handled twice as many cases 20 years ago than they do today. And I think the capability to address more issues is there in the Court. Senator LEAHY. My time is up, but I think you will find both the Chairman and the Ranking Member of this Committee believe they could handle more. Thank you, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. I think you have really acquitted yourself as well as anybody I have seen in the ten nominations for the Supreme Court that I have been part of. And I just have to—I want to correct the record a little bit. It isn’t the Ginsburg rule, although that has been referred to by almost all of us, including me. It is the Thurgood Marshall rule, the Rehnquist rule, the Kennedy-SouterThomas-Ginsburg-Breyer, just to name a few, rule because in every case, as I stated in my original remarks, the individual nominee has to draw a line as to what they can discuss and what they cannot. And you have drawn, I think, a fair line here throughout these proceedings, and I commend you for it. And there is just no excuse for being pushed to try and answer questions about cases that are likely to come before the Court or presently are before the Court. And I think the American people are starting to really fully realize that now as a result of these hearings. Now, Judge Roberts, as you know, the war on terror is a unique challenge in American history. As a consequence, many novel

issues regarding Presidential authority to prosecute the war on terror will doubtless come before the Supreme Court. I think we all recognize the need to be careful in our questioning so you are not placed in the position of pre-committing yourself to any particular viewpoints on Executive power that would compromise your ability to render a fair judgment as cases come before the Court.
But let me ask you a general question on terrorism. It is a question that many in Congress and the administration and the public have had to struggle with, particularly in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. The question is this: What is the best way for our society to protect ourselves against terrorists not affiliated with a nation state, wear no uniforms, and really secrete themselves in ways that have never been done before? On the one hand, there are very specific international rules embodied in the Geneva Conventions that specify how enemies captured during traditional warfare are to be treated. On the other hand, we have the traditional criminal law protections contained in Title 18 of the United States Code that define the rights accorded to criminals such as the famous Miranda warnings—warning, I should say, and the right to obtain counsel.
What everyone is struggling with is how do we apply these two traditional methods against nontraditional enemies who clearly are nontraditional? Let us make no mistake. Their goal is to destroy our society and way of life, and they will use weapons of mass destruction if they can. I don’t think anybody doubts that.
Now, let me just ask you this general question. Will you give us assurance that you will keep an open mind as the administration and Congress adopt and implement new policies and legal procedures that govern the apprehension, interrogation, and detention of suspected terrorists?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator, I will. I certainly am not qualified to comment on the best approaches in the war on terror or the most effective approaches. That is the responsibility, obviously, of the other branches. The responsibility of the judicial branch is to decide particular cases that are presented to them in this area according to the rule of law, and that is what I have tried to do, and that is what I will continue to do, either on the court of appeals or another court.
Senator HATCH. Well, thank you. Now, also yesterday the Democratic staff of the Committee released a press release stating that you failed to distance yourself from what it called your ‘‘earlier cramped positions on Title IX and women’s rights.’’ And after listening to you yesterday, I did not find your earlier positions cramped at all. In fact, as you explained here to the Committee, many of the documents that questioners relied upon reflected the positions of the Reagan administration for which you worked.
Now, what assurance can you give the Committee that you will fairly interpret the civil rights laws, including critical statutes such as Title IX, fully and fairly, consistent with the purposes Congress intended in passing these laws?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I can give the commitment that I appreciate that my role as a judge is different than my role as a staff lawyer for an administration. As a judge, I have no agenda. I have a guide in the Constitution and the laws and the precedents of the
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00322 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

311
Court, and those are what I would apply with an open mind, after fully and fairly considering the arguments and assessing the considered views of my colleagues on the bench. That’s the way I would approach cases in that area, as in any other area.
The approach of someone who is obviously a staff lawyer in an administration is very different. The approach of someone who is an advocate for a client before the Court is obviously very different. Those are positions that I have held in the past. I am now a judge, and I have had the experience and I think my record will establish that that is how I approach cases across the spectrum of issues that are raised before the courts.
Senator HATCH. And reasonable people can differ on some of these issues.
Judge ROBERTS. Oh, certainly. Senator HATCH. And the Grove City case, you won that case, didn’t you? Judge ROBERTS. The administration’s position prevailed before the Court. Senator HATCH. That is right. In other words, the position that you had advocated prevailed. Then we did not like it up here on Capitol Hill, so we passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act and we changed it, right? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, which, of course, is always the prerogative of Congress when you’re dealing with a question of statutory interpretation, and that’s part of a regular interchange between the Court and the Congress. Sometimes if the Court gets something wrong, Congress can fix it. Even if the Court gets it right but Congress thinks the approach ought to be changed, Congress is free to legislate for a different result. Senator HATCH. So I find it strange to criticize you because you won a case in the Supreme Court and have not advocated against women’s rights in any way, shape, or form ever in your career, as far as I can understand. Is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. That’s correct, Senator. Senator HATCH. And, in fact, you are a strong supporter of women’s rights and gender equality? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator. Senator HATCH. Okay. Now, let me just ask you a question that relates to some of the answers you gave yesterday regarding the voting rights. Even as the hearing was unfolding, again, Democratic staffers of the Committee issued a press release that said that you had missed an opportunity to distance yourself from what the release called your ‘‘earlier narrow positions on the reach of the Voting Rights Act.’’ Now, that is not what I heard you say, nor do I believe that is what the public heard. A Democratic press release said that you had resorted to vague generalities about the importance of voting. Now, as I heard you, I heard you explain the vigorous debate that took place regarding reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act in the 1980s. By the way, I was part of that debate. I felt very deeply that the effects test should apply to section 5 to those States that had a history of discrimination. But I also felt very deeply at the time that the intent test should apply to all the other States in section 2, which was the position I think the administration took
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00323 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

312
that you had to do some research on and within the administration.
Now, I lost in Committee. I was arguing that all of the States that did not have a history of discrimination should not have—be burdened by the effects test, which basically says that the effects of what happens looks like discrimination, it therefore is, even if there was never an intent to commit discrimination. Now, I lost, but I fell that the Voting Rights Act is the most important civil rights bill in history, and I felt it then. I voted for the amended bill with the effects test language in section 2, and have been a strong supporter ever since.
Would that be fair to describe your feelings about that? Judge ROBERTS. Well, yes, Senator. The debate as you remember was over whether or not Section 2 should be extended without change as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Mobile v. Bolden, or whether it should be changed to incorporate the effects test and later the totality of the circumstances test. The administration position at the time was to extend the Voting Rights Act for the longest period in history without change, and that was the position that I was working on at the time, and Congress eventually decided, with—Senator Dole and some of the other Senators developed a compromise position on Section 2, and that was enacted with the support of the administration. The one thing that was clear to me throughout those extended debates was that the people on both sides of the issue, in good faith, supported extension of the Voting Rights Act, and recognized the importance of the Voting Rights Act in securing civil liberties for all Americans. It wasn’t a dispute about the goal. It wasn’t a dispute about the objective. It wasn’t a dispute about the importance. It was a dispute about whether to extend the Act without change or whether to make changes in the Act, and that was what the debate was about. Senator HATCH. And the difference was, is that the administration vehemently wanted to pass the Voting Rights Act as it existed that was somewhat difficult to pass originally when it was originally passed, and that was a decent, honorable position. But when it was changed through our democratic process up here on Capitol Hill, I felt for the worse at the time, but I feel like I was wrong at the time. Then we voted for it. In fact, it was my friend, Senator Kennedy, who insisted that I come down to the White House as part of the bill signing team because he knew how deeply I felt about this. But there was a legitimate reason to take the administration’s position, and the administration, once the compromise was reached with Senators Dole and Kennedy, the administration accepted that as well, and so did you. That was a point I just kind of wanted to make because I think it is important to realize that we can sometimes get to a point where we misconstrue the intentions of decent, honorable people, and I count myself one of those. Even though I lost in Committee, I voted for this bill because to me it is the most important civil rights bill in history, albeit, others are very important as well. Now, I just want to tell you that, like I say, I have been here for 29 years, and I have been through 10 of these. I think 10 if I recall correctly. And in all of that time we have seen some really

sterling, brilliant, wonderful people before this Committee, but I have never seen anybody who has done a better job of explaining himself than you have. If people cannot vote for you, then I doubt that they can vote for any Republican nominee. You have made a very, very strong presentation here, and I hope the American people realize that, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle realize that, and I look forward to seeing you as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and will do everything in my power to see that you are confirmed.
With that, I have eight and a half minutes left, I reserve the balance of my time.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Good morning, Senator. Senator KENNEDY. I would like to, if we could, come back, and perhaps in a follow-up round, to the issue of civil rights, because as has been mentioned here by others, it is the overarching issue, I think, for our country and our society. I think our Founders did not get it right at the time of the drafting of the Constitution. We have had a Civil War. This country went through an extraordinary period of time led by Dr. King in the 1950s, and then we had that extraordinary moment of Dr. King here at the Lincoln Memorial, which I think touched the conscience of the Nation, people from all over the country. We were stuck for months on the 1964 Act, as you probably remember. Everett Dirksen opened up the possibility for reaching a compromise on the public accommodations provision. We spent 8 hours, a number of us in the Judiciary Committee, with Nick Katzenbach over in the Capitol Office, and had an agreement at that time there would be no amendments on the public accommodations; we could amend other provisions. And the legislation went forward, and was monumental in its importance and consequence. Then we came back and realized that the most important legislation that we could probably address—we still had a way to go on housing and employment, but although employment was included in the ‘64 Act, but not to a great extent—was in the Voting Rights Act. And we had extensive hearings. During the course of those hearings by this Committee, other Committees as well, we listened to Attorney General Katzenbach, who had been working with Senator Dirksen, really the architect, under the leadership of President Johnson, certainly, but the architect of the ‘64 Act. And he testified before this Committee about the Section 2 provisions, and in his testimony on the Section 2 provisions, he said, Section 2 applies to any voting practice or procedure if its purpose or effect was to deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race or color. So many of us, including the civil rights community, believed that the effects test was operative at that time. That bill passed the House by 333–85, 77–19 in the Senate. The next thing that happened is we had the series of cases, as you recall, and the overarching test case was the Zimmer case, but we had a number of other cases. It was the Fifth Circuit that dealt for the most part with the whole range of southern States where
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00325 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

314
many of these voting challenges had existed, although I certainly recognize we have a long way to go in my own State of Massachusetts. But the Fifth Circuit en banc, effectively in the Zimmer v. McKeithen case—issued the lead case on the effects test—and that was followed by a series of cases, for a long period of time.
You are aware of this history? Judge ROBERTS. I am remembering it from when we addressed this debate 23 years ago, yes. Senator KENNEDY. But it sounds familiar. Then we went up to 1980 and we had the Mobile case, which effectively put the intent test in. And after the Mobile case, as you well remember, the Justice Department dropped a whole series of cases that had been prepared under the effects test because they did not believe that they could make the case on the intent test, on the whole series. This sent a very powerful message to individuals across the South, and other parts of the country, that the additional kind of a burden to demonstrate intention was going to be so substantial in terms of resources. To try and determine the intent of individuals that lived many years ago would be virtually impossible. That happened. The Justice Department dropped scores of cases. It was one of the important reasons that the civil rights community and many of us believed that it was so important at the time of the extension of the Voting Rights case in 1982, that we put the effects test in. You believed, as I remember, and as we have gone over, that it should have been a restatement of the existing law, as you correctly stated yesterday, which was the intent test. Am I correct so far? Judge ROBERTS. That was the administration position. Senator KENNEDY. The administration’s position. I remember William French Smith testifying before this Committee to that effect at that particular time. Every civil rights group in 1982 supported the effects test. Groups like the NAACP Legal Defense, National Urban League, Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights Under Law, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, National Council of La Raza, League of United Latin American Voters, League of Women Voters, and Congressional Black Caucus, the list goes on. And the House went ahead and passed the legislation with the effects test by 389–24, 389–24. The legislation included language which reflected the concern of the Administration about whether the intent test was going to lead to either proportional representation or to quotas. That language was included in the House legislation that passed, and it included the fact that members of a minority group have not been elected in numbers equal to the group’s proportion of the population, should not in and of itself constitute a violation of this section. I thought this addressed, for all intents and purposes, the concerns that the Administration, and most of in the civil rights community had with regard to the issue of proportional representation. You roughly remember that or are aware— Judge ROBERTS. I certainly remember the provision in the House bill at the time.

315
Senator KENNEDY. So we also now included that language in the Senate bill. Now, the House bill passed. The Senate bill had 61 cosponsors prior to the time that we adopted the Dole amendment. That legislation was on its way. That legislation was good as done, quite frankly. The Dole amendment was effectively a restatement of what was in the House bill, and it had been included. But the Administration after that said, ‘‘Well, if they are going to include that as the Dole amendment, we will let up in our opposition and we will eventually support it.’’
Now, during the time after the passage of the House bill and prior to the passage of the Senate bill, even though the House had passed it, you still strongly maintained the Administration’s position, did you not?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I was still working for the administration, Senator. President Reagan’s position was to extend the Act without change. As you mentioned, that was the Attorney General’s position. I was a Special Assistant to the Attorney General, and I was doing my best to implement their views and support their views.
Senator KENNEDY. History shows that after the House bill, the Administration thought it should alter its position. Your memorandum to Attorney General Reynolds said, ‘‘Brad Reynolds has expressed some reservation about circulating any written statement on the question to the Hill. My own view is that something must be done.’’ Maybe that is a staffer, but it is separating yourself from Brad Reynolds, who was the leader on this issue at the time. Then you—
Judge ROBERTS. Well, with respect, Senator, my understanding— and I looked at that memorandum recently—is that the issue was whether or not to circulate something explaining the administration position, and I didn’t think Mr. Reynolds’s view was, you shouldn’t do that because you didn’t support the position. It was a question whether or not to circulate something at that time.
And my view was whether or not—I thought if the administration was advocating its position, it ought to get the position out.
Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think that is good. You are a good advocate and a strong believer in this.
The reason in this memorandum that you circle—and I have it right here, and I submit it into the Committee record, in the last paragraph you said: On the issue of the effects standard nationwide on the strength of the record will be constitutionally suspect, but also contrary to the most fundamental tenets of the legislative process on which the laws of this country are based.
The reason that I bring this up is to find out what you believed then and what you believe today, because you have a phrase in your memorandum that this provision, the effects test, is constitutionally suspect. Is that still your position? Because if it is your position on an issue as important as the Voting Rights Act that and moved the whole democratic process forward, resulted in the elections of hundreds and thousands of local leaders of color in all parts of the country, and Representatives in the House of Representatives, then I think the American people are entitled to know.
So specifically, specifically, do you believe that the effects test in the Voting Rights Act, which is currently the law, is constitutional?

316
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I don’t know what the analysis— you read a clause of a sentence and I would have to look at the whole memorandum to see exactly what the suggestion or the issue was in that case.
Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kennedy, would you make the memo available to him, please?
Senator KENNEDY. Sure. What I am interested in doing is asking now whether you believe that the effects test is constitutionally suspect. I am interested in today, quite frankly, more than what you had—
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator KENNEDY.—written before, whether you believe that it is suspect today or whether you find that it is settled law. It is fine if you want to, obviously, refer to it, but I am interested in what is your view today. Judge ROBERTS. What we’re referring to—what I’m referring to in this paragraph is the Court’s determination, if I’m looking at this correctly, under Section 5, its determination—the language you read notes the Supreme Court’s conclusion under Section 5, which is the pre-clearance provision that applies to jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, and what the Court had said in that case was that requirement of pre-clearance was acceptable given the record that the Congress had established in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 of the practices in those jurisdictions. And the concern was that if you extend the effects test nationwide, that the record which had been established only with respect to particular jurisdictions in the South wouldn’t apply nationwide, and that would be the basis for a constitutional challenge. The application of the test under Section 2, which is, as you know, if we use the shorthand effects test, it’s actually the totality of the circumstances test and it lays forth a number of considerations. I think there is some argument about how it closely attracts the effects test under Section 5 or if it’s a different totality of the circumstances approach. I’m not aware of any case that has questioned the constitutionality of the application of the totality of the circumstances case under Section 2 and if an issue on that were to be presented to me on the Supreme Court, which it may be, given the pending extension of the Voting Rights Act, I would, of course, confront that issue as a judge and not as a staff attorney for an administration with a position, and as a judge, I would come to the issue with an open mind and I would fully and fairly consider any arguments that might be presented. I don’t know if an argument is going to be presented about the application of the totality of the circumstances test nationwide. Again, I’m not aware of any challenges that have been presented to it since it was enacted. I don’t know if any will be if or when the Voting Rights Act is extended again, but if it is, I would confront that as a judge and not as a staff attorney for an administration with a particular position on that issue. Senator KENNEDY. Well, Judge, to my knowledge there hasn’t been, in legal circles suspicion about the unconstitutionality of the effects test as it applies to Section 5. That is as grounded as it can be. I am asking the specific question that was the really at issue

with the extension, and really the most important part historically about the Voting Rights Act, whether you think that that provision is constitutionally suspect today.
This is the backbone of effective voting in our country and our society and I think the American people are entitled to know whether you believe or suspect that that particular provision, which has passed just overwhelmingly by the House and the Senate, signed by President Reagan, and has resulted in this historic march to progress, is constitutionally sound. That is what I am interested in.
Judge ROBERTS. I have no basis. I am not aware of any constitutional challenge that has been brought to Section 2 since it was enacted. I’ve not—I have no basis for viewing it as constitutionally suspect and I don’t. If an issue were to arise before the Supreme Court or before the Court of Appeals, if I head back there, I would consider that issue with an open mind in light of the arguments. I’ve got no basis for viewing it as constitutionally suspect today and I’m not aware that it’s been challenged in that respect since it was enacted. It may have been, but as I say, I’m not aware of it.
Senator KENNEDY. I gather—you’ve had an extensive answer— that from that answer, I did hear that it is not constitutionally suspect as far as your view today.
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. Could I move on to the issue of affirmative action? Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator KENNEDY. In the Grutter v. Bollinger case, the Supreme Court decided very close, in a five-four decision, with Sandra Day O’Connor the deciding Justice, the Supreme Court upheld the university practices that considered race as one factor in its admission decisions. No one is talking today about quotas. We are talking about affirmative action as defined in this Grutter decision. The Court found that there was a constitutional affirmative action program aimed at achieving a racially diverse student body. In this decision, the Court expressly gave great weight to the representation by military leaders—military leaders—that said a highly qualified, racially diverse officer corps is essential to the military’s ability to fulfill its principal mission and to provide national security. What weight would you give to that kind of a comment or statement or testimony by the military in considering any issue dealing with affirmative action? Judge ROBERTS. Well, the weight it was given was to help satisfy the test, because the Court, as you know, in Grutter applied strict scrutiny because it was dealing with considerations on the basis of race and that required a showing of a compelling governmental interest to support that legislative action. The testimony of the military officers, as the Court explained, helped substantiate the compelling nature of the interest in having a diverse United student body. That was the weight that the Court gave it. There was, of course, the other case. There were two Michigan cases, the law school case and the university case, the Gratz case, where the Court did say that it looked too much like a quota in

318
that case because it was given determinative consideration as opposed to being one of a variety of factors that is considered.
The two cases together kind of show where the Court is coming out, at least in the area of higher education. The Court permits consideration of race or ethnic background so long as it is not sort of a make-or-break test.
Senator KENNEDY. Do you agree, then, with Justice O’Connor writing for the majority that gave great weight to the real-world impact of affirmative policies in universities? The reason—I have got 35 seconds left—you might say, well, this may eventually come on up before the Court, but the fact is, we know how every other Justice has voted because they have all voted and the American people would like to know where you stand on this very important public policy issue, particularly since Sandra Day O’Connor wrote such a compelling decision that was, I think, in the cause of fairness and justice.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I think I can answer the specific questions you asked because as you phrased the question, do you agree with her that it’s important to look at the real-world significance and impact, and I can certainly say that I do think that that is the appropriate approach without commenting on the outcome or the judgment in a particular case, that you do need to look at the real-world impact in this area, and I think in other areas, as well.
Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. My time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. We will now take a 15-minute break. We will reconvene at 11:25. [Recess 11:09 a.m. to 11:31 a.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will resume the hearings. We are just a few minutes tardy because we just finished a vote, and we now turn to Senator Grassley for his 20-minute second round. Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you. Once again, I compliment you on how you have handled yourself at these hearings. You have done very well. It is going to be very hard for people to cast a no vote against you. Judge Roberts, do you believe that every citizen who meets the qualifications set forth in the Constitution and our laws should have the opportunity to cast a free and unfettered vote? And as a follow-up, will you on the Court fairly apply the Voting Rights Act? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I certainly agree that every citizen who meets the qualifications not only has the right to vote but should vote. I think it’s a problem that we don’t have more people voting. And any issues that come before me under the Voting Rights Act, I will confront those with an open mind and decide them after full and fair consideration of the arguments, in light of the precedents of the Court, and in light of a recognition of the critical role that the right to vote plays as preservative of all other rights. Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the legislative history of a particular bill is critical to interpretation of the statute. Of course, Justice Scalia is of the opinion that most expressions of legislative history, like Committee reports or statements by the Senators on the floor, or in the House, are not entitled to great weight because they are unreliable indicators of legislative intent.

319
Presumably, Justice Scalia believes that if the members don’t actually write a report or don’t actually vote on a report, then there is no need to defer to this expression of congressional intent.
Now, obviously, I have great regard for Justice Scalia, his intellect and legal reasoning. But, of course, as I told you in my office, I don’t really agree with his position.
So I would like to ask you five questions. They are relatively short, so I will ask them all at once. What is your opinion, how important is legislative history to you? How have you utilized it? And will it be any different from your use on the circuit court versus what you might do on the Supreme Court? And did you refer to any Committee reports or congressional debate in any of your 39 briefs before the Supreme Court? And to what extent do you—and don’t start out with this last one. To what extent do you share Justice Scalia’s view on unreliability of legislative history? Although that is important, I would like—and I can repeat those, if you forget what I have asked.
Judge ROBERTS. Sure. Well, if I leave one out, you can remind me at the end. But obviously when you are dealing with interpreting a statute, the most important part is the text. You begin with the text, and as the Supreme Court has said, in many cases, perhaps most cases, that’s also where you end. The answer is clear.
I have, though, as a judge, relied on legislative history to help clarify ambiguity in the text. The Supreme Court stated once—and I think it’s a very important principle—you look to legislative history to clarify ambiguity. You don’t look to legislative history to create ambiguity. In other words, if the text is clear, that is what you follow, and that’s binding. And you don’t look beyond it to say, well, if you look here, though, maybe this clear word should be interpreted a different way.
On the other hand, we confront situations where the text is not clear, and the legislative history can be helpful in resolving that ambiguity. It requires a certain sensitivity to what you’re dealing with. All legislative history is not created equal. There’s a difference between the weight that you give a conference report and the weight you give a statement of one legislator on the floor. You have to, I think, have some degree of sensitivity in understanding exactly what you’re looking at, appreciate where those comments were made in the legislative process, be careful to make sure that they’re dealing with the same language that was eventually adopted. You have to, for example, be very skeptical about statements by opponents of the bill. It’s quite a common thing saying, well, this bill would do this, this, and this, and so we shouldn’t pass it. That’s not always the best guide as to what the sponsors really intended in the language. So it does require a certain sensitivity to what you’re dealing with.
But I have quoted and looked to legislative history in the past to help determine the meaning of ambiguous terms, and I would expect to follow that same approach on the Supreme Court. I don’t think there’s a difference there in terms of what things you think it is appropriate to look to, to help you do your job, which is to figure out what Congress intended.
Senator GRASSLEY. And you didn’t address Justice Scalia, but let me put it another way so I don’t put you in a bad position. You

320
would see, at least in some instances, where it needs to be used, reliability in legislative history.
Judge ROBERTS. In some instances, I think if you look at it carefully, you can make an assessment that this is a reliable guide. And one area I didn’t touch on in my arguments, I’ve certainly relied on legislative history in presenting arguments because, of course, in the Supreme Court you need five votes and not just the one. So you tend to cast your net as widely as possible. And at argument sometimes, Justice Scalia would not be as receptive to an argument based on legislative history as some of the others, but, again, the name of the game is counting to five when you’re arguing up there. And so I’ve certainly made arguments based on legislative history.
Senator GRASSLEY. In regard to how you view and use legislative history, I would like to discuss your opinion in the Totten v. Bombardier Corporation case interpreting the False Claims Act. The issue on appeal was whether Bombardier had met the presentment requirements of the False Claims Act. To violate the statute according to Section 3729(a)(1), a company must have presented its false claim to an officer or employee of the Federal Government. Importantly, Section 3729(c) explicitly provide that the term ‘‘claim’’ includes demands for payment submitted to Government contractors whether or not they are resubmitted to the Federal Government.
In your opinion, you wrote that those facts of that case did not consist of a false claims under the False Claims Act because there can only be a false claim if it is literally presented to somebody that is a Federal Government employee, I assume.
It seems to me that to reach this result, you inserted a resubmission requirement into the law in a place where it doesn’t, in fact, appear, Section 3729(a)(1), and, in fact, gave short shrift to the legislative history, which spelled out what Congress intended when it amended the Act in 1986. The legislative history of the Act and the Senate Committee report—and I didn’t refer to my authorship of the legislation, but, anyway, in our Senate Committee report explaining that liability under the False Claims Act attaches to a submission of, and I quote, ‘‘a false claim to the recipient of a grant from the United States or to a State under a program financed in part by the United States.’’
The legislative history also states that Congress sought to ensure that ‘‘a false claim was actionable although the claim or false statements were made to a party other than the Government if the payment thereon would ultimately result in a loss to the United States.’’
So my question is whether, on reflection, that is a fair way to deal with the express wishes of Congress and whether it is possible that you misunderstood the statute when you decided the Totten case, and why did you reject legislative history if you referred to it—and maybe you didn’t refer to it. But why did you reject legislative history regarding the resubmission requirement in the False Claims Act when you wrote the opinion in Totten?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, the answer to your question is it’s certainly possible that the majority in that case didn’t get it right and that the dissent that was a very strong dissent did get it right.
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00332 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

321
I think the majority got it right. There we focused on particular language. The issue in the case involved, as you know, a subcontractor claim. You have the United States giving money to—in this case, it was Amtrak, and then Amtrak using that money to hire a subcontractor—I think it was Bombardier—to do a particular part of the job. Everybody agreed that under the precedents that are applied, Amtrak is not the Government, can’t be considered part of the Government. And the statute, as you noted, required—it was triggered by the presentment of a false claim to an officer or employee of the United States. And the majority’s reasoning was that when—the false claim was one made by Bombardier to Amtrak, and the claim was submitted to Amtrak. And since Amtrak was not the Government, what Judge Rogers and I concluded was that that wasn’t presentment of a false claim to an officer or employee of the United States.
There was an extensive discussion between the majority and the dissent. The view that you have articulated was certainly presented in a compelling way by Judge Garland, my colleague on the court of appeals, and we spent a great deal of time on the case, and I think it’s reflected in the opinions. And that view was laid out. Judge Rogers and I thought that the statutory language that said the claim had to be presented to an officer or employee presented too high a hurdle for us to get over in looking at the legislative history.
But I’m happy to concede that it was among the more difficult cases I’ve had over the past 2 years. Anytime Judge Garland disagrees, you know you’re in a difficult area. And the function of his dissent to make us focus on what we were deciding and to make sure that we felt we were doing the right thing I think was well served. But Judge Garland disagreed, and so it’s obviously to me a case on which reasonable judges can disagree. And I just have to rest on the analysis in the majority opinion.
Senator GRASSLEY. Let me tell you something you might not be aware of, and that is that the Bush administration has filed an amicus brief in the Eleventh Circuit arguing that you had misread the False Claims Act in the Totten case, and in Atkins v. McIntyre, the administration has argued that there’s no presentment requirement in Section 3738(a)(2) of the False Claims Act, and that ‘‘the Totten majority misconstrued the language and purpose of the False Claims Act in concluding that the Act does not encompass false claim records statements submitted to recipients of Federal funds absent resubmission to a United States officer or employee.’’ And I assume if I ask you if you have an opinion on that you can’t answer it.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, not on that one. I do know the Bush administration filed an amicus brief in our case as well. I guess this would be one of those cases I would cite in response to the question of whether I’m capable of ruling against the administration. We did in that case. Again, the arguments, I think, were well presented on both sides, and Judge Rogers and I gave it our best shot, and the opinion will stand or fall on its own.
Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I hope sitting in the marble palace you will remember that I have great pride in the success of the False Claims Act—$8 billion coming back to the Federal Treasury.

322
Judge Roberts, you filed an amicus brief in the case of United States v. Halper, a case which raised the question of whether a civil False Claims Act case could implicate the double jeopardy clause. The Supreme Court agreed with your arguments and held that the double jeopardy clause protects a convicted criminal defendant from a second punishment in the form of a civil sanction that ‘‘may not fairly be characterized as remedial’’ because it is ‘‘overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damage the defendant has caused.’’ As you know, the Halper decision was later overturned by Hudson.
Judge Roberts, do you consider the False Claims Act treble damages provisions to be excessive, in the words of the Court, ‘‘overwhelmingly disproportionate,’’ and also in the words of the Court, ‘‘not fairly characterized as remedial’’?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you’ve touched on a case that’s very close to my heart, Senator. It was the first case I argued before the Supreme Court. I was appointed by the Court to argue it on behalf of Mr. Halper.
It was an unusual case. It arose—the conspiracy at issue was a slight inflation of—I believe it was Medicare or Medicaid claims that this individual was submitting. I think he added $1 or $2 to every claim. And yet under the law at that time, there was a minimum penalty for each false claim. These numbers won’t be right, but he had something like 300 false claims for a grand total of maybe $700, but under the statute, he was assessed a civil penalty of several million dollars because each of the false claims was a separate penalty.
And the issue was, after having been sentenced criminally, would a civil penalty of several—and, again, I’m not sure of the numbers, but several million dollars for $700 or so of fraud, was that remedial and civil or was it punishment? And the Court agreed with my submission at the time that that was punishment. It led to some difficulty, I think, in administering civil and criminal laws down the line, and as you said, 8 years later they reversed course and overruled the Halper precedent.
But the provision that you specifically mentioned, treble damages, that is a little different. There it’s a much closer connection, obviously just 3 times whatever the damages are. In the Halper case, it was a much more disproportionate impact, and that’s what led the Court, I think, to conclude that that looks like punishment. Treble damages is something that’s familiar in the law in a number of areas and is not regarded as impermissible punishment in this context.
Senator GRASSLEY. Are you familiar with the legal arguments that some opponents of the False Claims Act have made to the effect that its qui tam provisions are unconstitutional under Articles II and III, and if so, do you have an opinion on these arguments, and before you answer, I would like to remind you that at least since the first Congress was involved in this, I would like to assume that the Framers of the Constitution, because the First Congress enacted several qui tam statutes, that if that be any deference to you in giving—whether this factor would make any difference to you when assessing the constitutionality of qui tam statutes today.

323
Judge ROBERTS. I think, if my memory serves, that the Article III objections, and just so we’re on the same page, the qui tam statutes, of course, are when a private individual brings suit on behalf of the government for fraud on the government and in return gets a percentage of the recovery. And as you noted, it’s been under the False Claims Act very successful in securing recovery of funds on behalf of the government.
The Vermont case—and I’m not remembering it any more than that, it was a case from Vermont—I think addressed most of the Article III issues. The objection was that individual has no standing, I think, because he doesn’t necessarily have an interest, and what the Court said was that the individual has standing as a result of the bounty, if you will, the percentage he gets. That satisfies the standing requirement, so those objections are out of the way.
I do know that some have raised additional objections under Article II, which goes to the fact that this might interfere with the Executive’s authority to execute the law. In other words, you have private individuals bringing suit. I’m not sure that those issues have been finally resolved, and obviously, if those cases do come up, I’ll want to keep an open mind.
The fact that you mentioned, obviously, about historic practice, that is something that the Court does look to in assessing constitutionality. If it’s something that the Founders were familiar with or a practice that they engaged in and showed no disagreement with, that, while not determinative, that is a factor that the Court would look at. I don’t know if any of those cases are going to come before the Court, but if they do, it’s one of the considerations that’ll have to be taken into account.
Senator GRASSLEY. Other than the Totten case and the Halper case, have you ever written or spoken publicly about the issue of the constitutionality of qui tams or any other provisions of the False Claims Act, to your memory?
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t remember any, no, Senator. Senator GRASSLEY. Okay. Judge Roberts, in 1986, while serving as an Associate White House Counsel, you approved Reagan administration testimony regarding the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1986. You probably recall that the Reagan administration opposed that legislation, which is now law. Could you explain what role, if any, you had in formulating the administration’s position on the Whistleblower Protection Act? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t recall any role, Senator. Our office—the Counsel’s office would routinely review testimony that was about to be given. We were just looking out for particular constitutional concerns or issues. We generally did not get into the substance. The substance of that would have been shaped over in the Justice Department and we would have really been looking out for anything that we thought infringed on the constitutional authorities of the President or presented other consistency issues. But the substance of the testimony is not something I was involved in. Senator GRASSLEY. Do you feel that you have any bias against the False Claims Act or Whistleblower Protection Act that would impact on your ability to fairly decide cases on those statutes? Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator. I have had some whistleblower cases, different aspects I do recall coming up in the Court of Ap-

peals and I think in some cases, we ruled in favor and in some cases, we ruled against. So I have seen those cases and had no difficulty fairly and objectively deciding them.
Senator GRASSLEY. Are you against cameras in the courtroom like Justice Rehnquist was?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, my new best friend, Senator Thompson, assures me that television cameras are nothing to be afraid of—
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS.—but I don’t have a set view on that. I do think it’s something that I would have to—I would want to listen to the views of, if I were confirmed, to my colleagues— Senator GRASSLEY. I would suggest then to the Chairman that we move quickly on that bill before he has got an opinion on it. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. I intend to do just that, Senator Grassley, now that I have your support. Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Biden? Senator BIDEN. Good morning, Judge. How are you? Judge ROBERTS. Good morning, Senator. Fine, thanks. Senator BIDEN. I went back and looked at something you said yesterday, which I was reminded of by my son, who has done some appellate work—nothing like you—and he said, ‘‘I thought I heard him say this,’’ and then I went to the staff and got it. Yesterday morning you said, ‘‘I went back once and counted the questions during my half-hour. There were over 100 questions the Court asked.’’ So you are not all offended by us interrupting you like we do. You are used to being interrupted, aren’t you? Judge ROBERTS. I am used to being interrupted before the court, that is for sure, Senator. [Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. Well, we are kind of the court here. We are kind of the court. You are not entitled to the job, God love you. You have been nominated and your job is to demonstrate that there is no presumption, as you well know. So I hope you won’t mind some questions. I promise I won’t interrupt if you give short answers, okay? Judge ROBERTS. I’ll try, Senator. Senator BIDEN. All right. Great. I would like to follow up on yesterday. I asked you if you agreed there was a right of privacy to be found in the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment and you said, and I quote, ‘‘I do, Senator. I think that the Court’s expression, and I think if my reading of the press is correct, I think every Justice on the Court believes that to some extent or another.’’ Is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator BIDEN. Now, one of the things that has been amazing— you are one of the best witnesses that I think has come before this committee, and I have been here 30-some years—is that you have convinced the folks who share Senator Brownback’s view that you are going to be just right for them, and you have convinced the folks that share Senator Kennedy’s view that you are going to be

325
just right for them. And I think I would like to plumb a little bit more closely this notion of how you view this right of privacy.
Now, if you take a look at Justice Scalia’s comment about that right to privacy found in the 14th Amendment as it related to the Casey case, he said the issue is whether abortion is a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States. I am sure it is not because of two simple facts. The Constitution says absolutely nothing about it and the longstanding traditions, et cetera.
Then, in that same case, the quote coming from—I have got to make sure I get the right Justice here—from the O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter dissent, they said ‘‘the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full-term is subject to anxieties to physical constraints, and to pain that only she must bear.’’ Her suffering is too intimate and personal for the state to insist without more upon its own version of the woman’s role. Two fundamentally different views of the right to privacy as it relates to that issue.
In Cruzan, the case relating to whether or not fully competent adults have the right to refuse unwanted medical treatment, Justice Scalia said in his opinion, quote, ‘‘that the Federal court have no business in this field; that American law has always accorded the State the power to prevent, by force if necessary, suicide—including suicide by refusing to take appropriate measures necessary to preserve one’s life.’’
Justice Kennedy, in Lawrence, as you well—I know you know all this, but I just want to try to get a sense where you are. He said, ‘‘Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of a person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.’’ Obviously, fundamentally different.
And then the same goes when O’Connor said, in Cruzan ‘‘I agree that a protected liberty interest in refusing unwanted medical treatment may be inferred from our prior decisions and that the refusal of artificially delivered food and water is encompassed within that liberty interest.’’
So the point I am making is obvious, that there are very, very, very disparate views. Can you tell me what side you come down closer on?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, first of all— Senator BIDEN. I am not asking you to comment on any case. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I can say that it is my view that all of the Justices—I think if a case like the Glucksberg case in which a majority subscribe to the view, there is an appropriate mode of analysis to determine the content of the Liberty Clause and it does include protection beyond physical restraint and that that protection applies in a substantive manner. Now, there are legal theorists, there are judges and jurists who do not agree with that, who do not agree that there is a right of privacy protected under the Due Process Clause, who do not agree that the liberty protected extends beyond freedom from physical restraint. Their view is that it means you cannot be basically imprisoned or arrested without due process and that means only that you get some type of procedural protection.

326
That is not my understanding of where the Justices on the Supreme Court are and it’s not my understanding. I believe that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause is not limited to freedom from physical restraint, that it includes certain other protections, including the right to privacy. As you know, the Court has tried to map out in a series of cases that go back to Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce and all that and in various instances as the claims have arisen, and that it’s protected not simply from procedural depravation. That is—
Senator BIDEN. If I may interrupt, that is not the question I asked you. Thank you for that lesson, and I understand what you are saying. I am asking you a specific question.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, and— Senator BIDEN. Do you side more within that context with the views of Scalia and Thomas, which say that consenting adults do not have, if they are both male or female, do not have the right to engage in sexual conduct, the State can determine that—let me put it another way. My family faced, I am sure many people in this audience’s families have faced a difficult decision of deciding when to no longer continue the application of artificial apparatus to keep your father or mother or husband or wife or son or daughter alive. It is of great moment to the American public. There is a view expressed by Justice Scalia that there is no right that is absolute on the part—or no fundamental right that exists for a family member, assuming the person is not capable of making the decision themselves, to make that judgment. He says, and I am speaking in layman’s terms, he says the State legislature can make that decision. I firmly believe, unless there is some evidence that the family is incompetent, the husband or the wife, with the advice of the doctor, should be able to make that decision. What do you think? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, that does get into an area that is coming before the Court. There is a case pending on the docket right now that raises the question of whether or not State legislatures have a prerogative to lay down rules on certain end-of-life issues— Senator BIDEN. It is suicide, isn’t it, Judge? Judge ROBERTS. Well, in that case, it’s the application of the Federal Controlled Substance law. Senator BIDEN. Right. Judge ROBERTS. The issue of illness in those cases do come before the Court. The Glucksberg case raised a similar question. The Cruzan case that you mentioned, presented it in a very difficult context of an incompetent individual, no longer able to make a decision, and the question of how the State law should apply in that situation. Those cases do come before the Court. Senator BIDEN. Do you think the State—just talk to me as a father. Do not talk to me—just tell me, just philosophically, what do you think? Do you think—not what the Constitution says. What do you feel? Do you feel personally, if you are willing to share with us, that the decision of whether or not to remove a feeding tube after a family member is no longer capable of making a judgment, they are comatose, to prolong that life should be one that the legislators in Dover, Delaware should make or my mother should make?

Judge ROBERTS. No, I’m not going to consider issues like that in the context as a father or a husband or anything else.
Senator BIDEN. Well, you did— Judge ROBERTS. I think— Senator BIDEN. Sorry. Judge ROBERTS. I think, obviously, putting aside any of those considerations, these issues are the most difficult we face as people, and they are profoundly affected by views of individuality and moral views, and deeply personal views. That’s obviously true as a general matter. But at the same time, the position of a judge is not to incorporate his or her personal views in deciding issues of this sort. If you’re interpreting a particular statute that governs in this area, your job as a judge is to interpret and apply that according to the rule of law. If you’re addressing claims of a fundamental right under the liberty, protected by the Due Process Clause, again, the view of a judge on a personal matter or a personal level is not the guide to the decision, and— Senator BIDEN. Right. Well, Judge, let me ask you then, with your permission, about your constitutional view. Do you think the Constitution encompasses a fundamental right for my father to conclude that he does not want to continue, he does not want to continue on a life support system? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I can’t answer that question in the abstract because— Senator BIDEN. It is not abstract, that is real. Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, as a legal matter it is abstract because the question would be in any particular case, is there a law that applies that governs that decision? What does the law apply— Senator BIDEN. That is the question, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Well, no. Senator BIDEN. Can any law trump a fundamental right to die? Not to commit suicide, a right to decide ‘‘I no longer want to be hooked up to this machine, the only thing that’s keeping me alive.’’ ‘‘I no longer want to have this feeding tube in my stomach,’’ a decision that I know I have personally made, and many people out here have made, and the idea that a State legislature could say to my mom, ‘‘Your father wants the feeding tube removed. He’s asked me. The doctors heard it,’’ and the State legislature’s decided that, no, it can’t be removed. Are you telling me that is even in play? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, what I’m telling you is, as you know, there are cases that come up in exactly that context so that it is in play, and the sense is that there are cases involving disputes between people asserting their rights to terminate life, to remove feeding tubes either on their own behalf or on behalf of others. There is legislation that States have passed in this area that governs that, and there are claims that are raised that the legislation is unconstitutional. Those are issues that come before the Court, and as a result, I will confront those issues in light of the Court’s precedents, with an open mind. I will not take to the Court whatever personal views I have on the issues, and I appreciate the sensitivity involved. They won’t be based on my personal views. They’ll be based on my understanding of the law. Senator BIDEN. That is what I want to know about because without any knowledge of your understanding of the law, because you

will not share it with us, we are rolling the dice with you, Judge. We are going to face decisions, you are, and the American public is going to face decisions about whether or not, as I said, patents can be issued for the creation of human life. You are going to be faced with decisions about whether or not there is a right to refuse extraordinary medical, heroic medical efforts that you do not want as an individual, and you are fully capable, mentally, of making that decision. The idea is that without a specific fact pattern before you, as keeps getting repeated here, the law is about life, it is about facts. We are not asking you—there is no fact situation before you—about whether or not a person, fully mentally capable of making a decision, chooses to say, ‘‘I no longer want this feeding tube in my stomach. Please remove it.’’ And whether or not that is a fundamental constitutional right.
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, that’s asking me for a opinion in the abstract on a question that will come before the Court. And when that question does come before the Court, the litigants before me are entitled to have a Justice deciding their case with an open mind, based on the arguments presented, based on the precedents presented. I have told you with respect how I would go about deciding that case. It begins with the recognition that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause does extend to matters of privacy, that it is not limited to restraints on physical freedom, and that that protection is protected—it extends in a substantive way, and not simply procedurally.
I have also explained the sources that judges look to in determining the content of that privacy protected by the Liberty Clause. They’re the ones that have been spelled out in the Court’s opinion, the Nation’s history, traditions and practices.
And I have explained how judges apply that history, tradition and practices in light of the limited role of a judge to interpret the law and not make the law. The limited role of the judge in light of the prerogatives of the legislature.
Senator BIDEN. Judge, I understand that. Justice Scalia says the same thing, and draws a very fundamentally different conclusion, and O’Connor. So you have told me nothing, Judge. With all due respect, look, this is—it is kind of interesting, this kabuki dance we have in these hearings here, as if the public does not have a right to know what you think about fundamental issues facing them. There is no more possibility that any one of us here would be elected to the United States Senate without expressing broadly, and sometimes specifically, to our public what it is we believe. The idea that the Founders sat there and said, ‘‘Look, here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to require the two elected branches to answer questions of the public with no presumption they should have the job as Senator, President or Congressman, but guess what? We’re going to have a third coequal branch of Government that gets to be there for life, never, ever, ever again to be able to be asked a question they don’t want to answer. And you know what? He doesn’t have to tell us anything. It’s okay as long as he is’’— as you are—‘‘a decent, bright, honorable man. That’s all we need to know. That’s all we need to know.’’
Look, I only have 3 minutes and 45 seconds left, and by the way, I would ask permission for the record to introduce the number of

329
questions asked by Senator Hatch and others, very specific questions to Justice Ginsburg with very specific answers on these very questions. I would like to ask for that to be submitted for the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record.
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, could I— Senator BIDEN. I still have the floor, and I will yield to you since you can speak after the clock is out and I cannot, okay? I am sure you understand that. And I am sure if I am ever before the Supreme Court, you will give me more time and you will not interrupt me. [Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. Look, here is the point I want to make. I asked— and I am sure you are not going to answer it—I asked Justice Ginsburg a question about footnote 6 in the Michael H. case, and the whole issue there is, as you well know, whether or not you keep talking—it sounds wonderful to the uneducated ear, the non-lawyer’s ear—that you are going to look at history and tradition. You and I both know that how you determine history and tradition determines outcomes. In that case, as you will recall, there was a question of a natural father—you could prove by a blood test and DNA that he was the natural father—of a child he wanted to see, that happened to be born to a woman who was living with her married husband, so the child was illegitimate. And so in determining whether or not there are any visitation rights, there is a famous footnote there. I am going to do this quickly, I have 2 minutes and 7 seconds. The Court said, Scalia said in footnote 6, ‘‘Look, you go back and look at the specific historical precedent, in short—have bastards ever been protected in the law.’’ And then said, ‘‘No, no, no, that’s not how you go back. You go back and look at fatherhood. Was fatherhood ever something that was part of the traditions and part of the embraced notions of what we hold dear? Is that worthy of protection?’’ Now, Scalia said, ‘‘No, no, no, no, no. I looked up the record. Bastards have never been protected in English common law; therefore, there is nothing going on here.’’ ‘‘And, by the way, you should never go back,’’ he says, ‘‘and look at the general proposition has fatherhood achieved a status of consequence. No, it is ‘have bastards achieved? ’ ’’ So, Judge, how do you—I am not asking you about a case. How do you—do you look at the narrowest reading of whether or not such an asserted right has ever been protected, or do you look at it more broadly? What is the methodology you use? Judge ROBERTS. I mean, I think you’re quite right that that is quite often the critical question in these cases, the degree of generality at which you define what the tradition, the history, and the practice you’re looking at. The example, I think, that I’ve always found it easiest to grasp was Loving v. Virginia. Do you look at the history of miscegenation statutes, or do you look at the history of marriage? Senator BIDEN. Thirty-three seconds left. Do you agree with O’Connor then?

Judge ROBERTS. Well, I get extra time, you said. Senator BIDEN. I know. But I don’t. I’ve got to get it in now. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Judge Roberts, when his red light goes on, you will have as much time as you want. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you. The point is that, again, the Court has precedents on precisely that question, about how you should phrase the level of generality. And you look at— Senator BIDEN. But which precedent do you agree with? There are competing precedents. Judge ROBERTS. Well, you do not look at the level of generality that is the issue that’s being challenged. So, for example, in Loving v. Virginia, if the challenge is, it seems to me—and this is what the Court’s precedents say. If the challenge is to miscegenation statutes, that’s not the level of generality because you’re going to answer it’s completely circular. Senator BIDEN. But that is specific, Judge. The generality was the right to marry. That is the generality. Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s what I’m saying. The dispute is do you look at it at that level of specificity or broader. And I’m saying you do not look at the narrowest level of generality, which is the statute that’s being challenged, because obviously that’s completely circular. You are saying there is obviously that statute that’s part of the history. So you look at it at a broader level of generality. Now, the only point I was going to make earlier—because I do think it is an important one. You make the point that we stand for election and we wouldn’t be elected if we didn’t tell people what we stand for. Judges don’t stand for election. I’m not standing for election, and it is contrary to the role of judges in our society to say that this judge should go on the bench because these are his or her positions and those are the positions they’re going to apply. Judges go on the bench and they apply and decide cases according to the judicial process, not on the basis of promises made earlier to get elected or promises made earlier to get confirmed. That’s inconsistent with the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court. Senator BIDEN. No one is asking for a promise. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. Senator BIDEN. Thank you. Thank you, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kyl? Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this last exchange is important because it goes back to what we talked about at the very beginning when some of us in our opening statements pledged to defend you if you stopped short of answering every question the way that every Senator felt important based upon your view that the matter in question might come before the Court, that the Canons of Judicial Ethics preclude you from doing that. A very wise Senator on this Committee once said something. Let me quote it to you. And, by the way, I contend that he is still wise. Senator BIDEN. I bet I am the wise one. Senator KYL. I am sorry? And this is what he said: ‘‘Judge, you not only have a right to choose what you will answer and not answer, but in my view, you
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00342 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

331
should not answer a question of what your view will be on an issue that clearly is going to come before the Court in 50 different forms, probably over your tenure on the Court.’’
Now, as I said, that was wise then. It is wise now. It is the statement of then-Chairman Joseph Biden in the Ginsburg hearings, and in all sincerity, I do believe Senator Biden to be wise, and I believe that comment is wise. It is what has animated your approach to answering probably by now hundreds of questions that have been asked of you. And you have answered every question; in some cases, however, you have stopped short of advising us on what you believe the law to be because you felt that the matter was going to come before the Court. But you did not stop there. When permitted, you expanded to tell us why you thought it was a matter that might come before the Court and what your general approach to the case would be in terms of your judicial philosophy, how you would approach judging the case, but that you did not want to talk about your view of what the law was, both because the case could come before the Court and also because it is pretty hard to formulate in a question all of the factual considerations that would permit you to know what law would be specifically applicable to that particular case. And you and I talked a little bit about the facial challenge to statutes versus the ‘‘as applied’’ kind of problem.
So with respect to this last interchange you had with Senator Biden—and, by the way, I will say again to compliment my colleagues, if anybody ever contended that Senators were not both diligent in pursuing what they want to pursue and also very imaginative, they should watch this hearing because we have been blessed with the most creative ways of trying to pull out of you commitments on matters on which Senators would like you to make commitments.
But as Senator Biden just said—and I am paraphrasing here— he said without the knowledge of your personal views—he was talking at the time about end-of-life issues—we are rolling the dice. And your response to that, as I understand it, is: My personal views are irrelevant to a case that comes before me of Jones v. Smith, of X v. Y. What I personally think about issues has nothing to do with the resolution of the dispute between those two parties. And were I to let them intrude, I would not be doing my job as a judge—fairly taking the facts of their case and then applying the law as I understand it to be to reach a decision.
Moreover, Judge, isn’t it the case that if you were to state your views on such subjects as they might pertain to a case that would come before the Court, wouldn’t you actually have to recuse yourself from deciding that case and, therefore, all of the discussion, all of the effort to get you committed to a particular point of view, would be for naught, because if you expressed a particular point of view, you couldn’t sit on the case anyway, or am I incorrect in that?
Judge ROBERTS. I think that’s a concern that other nominees have raised in the past, particularly given the expression of views as part of the confirmation process. It’s not supposed to be a bargaining process, and if you start stating views with respect to particular issues of concern to one Senator, then obviously everyone is going to have their list. And when that individual nominee, if con-
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00343 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

332
firmed, if the bargain is successful from his or her point of view and he gets confirmed, he will have to begin each case not with the parties’ briefs and arguments but with the transcript of the confirmation hearing to see what he or she swore to under oath was their view in a particular area of the law or a particular case. And I think that would undermine the independence of the Supreme Court. It would undermine the integrity of the judicial process. Every one of the Justices on the Court today, every one of them refused to engage in that type of process. And if I am to sit with them, if I am confirmed, I feel I have to follow the same approach.
Now, I do think I have been more expansive than most nominees. I have gone back and read the transcripts, and some of them would not talk about particular cases even if it were unlikely that the case was going to come before the Court. And the reason they gave was, look, it is hard to draw the line. If I think this case is not going to come before the Court, what about this one? And maybe that will. And rather than trying to draw the line, I am just not going to do it. And those Justices were confirmed.
I have taken what I think is a more pragmatic approach. If I think an issue is not likely to come before the Court, I have told the Committee what my views on that case were, what my views on that case are. You know, perhaps that means I am in— it is sometimes difficult to draw the line. Perhaps that’s right. But, again, if I make the judgment—and other nominees may draw the line differently, may have drawn it differently in the past or differently in the future, the nominee I think has to be comfortable with the proposition that they’re not doing anything that’s going to undermine the integrity of the Court. Senator KYL. And I noted yesterday in response to a question, you said, ‘‘Well, that is the reward for trying to be more expansive.’’ You were talking about Griswold v. Connecticut, and I thought at the time, boy, he is expressing a view on a relatively recent case, and at least issues associated with it are clearly going to come before the Court. And I wondered, Does that go too far? Does that cross the line? But your point was the specific issue in the case and the precise holding of the case are not likely in your view to come before the Court, and, therefore, you expressed your opinion about that case and the law underlying the ruling in the case. So I would agree with you that not only have you attempted to answer every one of our questions, but you have also ventured into expressing your personal views on matters that you didn’t think would come before the Court, although, as you note, it is at least possible that some of them might. So hopefully you have not gone too far there. This I think is a great civics lesson. Some of this hearing should be encapsulated in law school courses to remind us about the difference between elected officials, who make policy, and judges, who are not supposed to make policy. I thought the questioning—I believe it was by Senator Brownback—earlier was instructive. You noted that the primary check and balance on the judiciary was its own self-restraint. Many of us believe that the Court has not exercised appropriate self-restraint in all cases, and that when it does not, it naturally generates concern expressed by the citizens of the country as reflected certainly by their elected representatives. And
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00344 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

333
we do express that concern. I think the Court has failed to exercise appropriate restraint in several matters.
One of the things that appeals to me from your approach to the law is that it appears to be a very traditional approach, which is that I am not sent there to make law, I am sent there to take whatever case comes before us and just decide the case. And that element of self-restraint and modesty is one which I think should be more the rule than it is today in courts at all levels. And I would commend that philosophy to all of the judges.
I think you have expressed it very well, and while I appreciate my colleagues’ desire to try to draw you out on your personal views about matters, I think you have drawn the line at an appropriate place. And you have certainly provided us with a great deal of information in the process—and, again, partly because you have explained to us, when you could not completely satisfy a Senator’s curiosity, why that was the case, but still tried to inform us about the basic issues that might exist in the case, the basic arguments that would be made on either side, but without giving us a hint as to which one of those you thought you might come down on the side of.
And I also think it is important that you have totally eschewed ideology here, saying that your own personal views or ideology do not have a place in your decisionmaking, and, therefore, they are pretty irrelevant to the questions that are asked here.
I have a whole notebook of questions here that, to one extent or another, have been dealt with, I think, by my colleagues. And I do not think it serves a purpose to go over them again. Let me just conclude with kind of a general comment, but before I do, just try to correct the record on—not necessarily correct, but add to the record on one very narrow point. You were discussing, I believe with Senator Kennedy, the Herrera v. Collins case, and he talked about innocence claims being heard by the Court, that a prisoner should have the right to present innocence claims.
I just wanted to ask you: Is it not the case that in Herrera v. Collins the Court did not address the proper route for bringing claims based on newly discovered forensic evidence such as DNA testing? Which is, of course, a relatively new phenomenon now, but not the issue presented in that case.
Judge ROBERTS. That’s right. There wasn’t—I don’t know if they had as much access to that type of evidence back then when it was argued, but it was certainly not that type of evidence. It was a new claim that somebody else did it, somebody who had just died. That was the new claim that they sought to raise at the last stage there. And I do think any issue arising with respect to DNA evidence— and those issues are working their way up through the Court. Those cases would have to be addressed on their own terms.
Senator KYL. Thank you. Well, let me conclude with this point. Some who are watching might come to the conclusion that there is a lot of repetition here, and that to some extent there is a lot of ‘‘Senator talk’’ expressing concern to you about different issues that are important to them. Frankly, I think this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is the only time that, before you take your position on the Court, you will have the opportunity to be directly lobbied in the political context,
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00345 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

334
in an appropriate way. We reflect the views of our constituents, and we have all got different issues on our minds. And there isn’t a one of them that is not a legitimate issue or concern. I brought up the matter of applying foreign law to American decisions on our Constitution, for example.
To me it seems appropriate that you hear from us, the political branch, concerns that we have about the way that the Court approaches its job. We may be right, we may be wrong. But it is important for you to hear that. I know that Justices read the newspapers and so on. But this is a very good forum to have us express to you concerns that we have about various issues. And we would not be talking about them if we did not think that they would come before the Court. So, in a sense, virtually everything we are talking about, we are trying in some way to get a point across to you because we believe it is likely to be decided by you.
And I think that is fine. You need to hear from us what our concerns are, even though perhaps we are trying to draw you out in areas that you obviously cannot be drawn out in with respect to future cases.
It is also important for us to get the feedback from you. There will not be very many other times that we will have a group of Senators sit down with the person that will likely be the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and have a legal conversation.
We will have to talk about matters relating to Court administration. That will be totally appropriate, and I am sure we will be doing that. But by and large, this is the only chance we have to have this kind of an interchange with you.
It is illuminating to me, as a student of constitutional law and someone who has practiced before the Court. I have learned a lot. Therefore, to those on the outside saying, well, it looks like a lot of Senators posturing, if they are listening very closely to your answers, I think they will find a great deal of meat, of knowledge, of the application of your wisdom to how you approach judging, and I find it very consistent with the traditions of our court and the rule of law in our country and this, therefore, becomes a very good reminder of what our rule of law is all about, what judging is based on, and the interrelationship between the representative bodies of our government and the third branch, which you represent.
I think this is all very instructive, very informative, and in my case, at least, with regard to your testimony, very comforting, because it seems to me that you are following the great tradition of the Court in your approach to the law, that you are careful, that you are cautious, and yet you are willing to look at the circumstances of our contemporary times in applying your judgment to the law that is before you.
Because I have that confidence, it is my intention to support your nomination, and because I think it unnecessary to delve into any other specific questions, I will yield back the remaining 5 minutes of my time.
Senator BIDEN. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Senator Biden? Senator BIDEN. A point of personal privilege, as we say in this body.

Senator KYL. On my time, since I had 5 minutes and I referred to Senator Biden. Please, take my time.
Senator BIDEN. Thank you. I have been quoted many times about what I said to Justice Ginsburg. With the permission of the Chairman, I will just take a second. I would like to read my whole quote, if I may, and then submit it all for the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Senator Biden, you may do that. You can even have more time. Senator Kyl has given—
Senator BIDEN. No, no, I don’t want to use the time. Let me just say, here is what else I said. I said, ‘‘Now, I would hope, as I said to you very briefly, that the way in which you outline the circumstance under which you would reply and not reply, that you will not make a blanket refusal to comment on things because obviously everything we could ask you is bound to come before the Court. There is not a controversial issue in this country that does not have a prospect of coming before the Court.’’
Continuing, ‘‘[I]f a nominee, although it is their right, does not answer questions that don’t go to what they would decide but how they would decide, I will vote against that nominee regardless of who it is,’’ this is continuing the quote, ‘‘And you can thank Justice Scalia for that.’’
At the close of the testimony, I said, ‘‘I would also point out that my concerns about you not answering questions have been met. You have answered my questions the second day and third day. At least from my perspective, you have been as forthcoming as any recent witness we have had.’’ I submit the entire statement for the record along with the answers to her questions from Senator Hatch, you, and others.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record.
Senator BIDEN. I thank the Chairman for his courtesy and I thank the witness for listening.
Chairman SPECTER. It is now 12:30 and a vote, two votes have been scheduled at this time, so we will take a lunch recess until 1:45, a quarter of 2:00.

We spent quite a bit of time yesterday discussing how you would decide cases, and as we all know, it is your view that Supreme Court Justices are umpires who are neutrally deciding cases. I want to discuss with you another area where I believe your analogy falls somewhat short. The Supreme Court not only, as you know, has the power to decide cases and to construe the Constitution, but it also has the sole and the absolute power to decide which cases it hears, which cases it decides, which parties get to be heard, and which parties do not get to be heard. So if you are confirmed, you will get to choose which cases will be placed on the Supreme Court’s docket with the vote of yourself and only three other Justices, as you know. Making

this choice, your opinions, your perspectives, and your life experiences obviously matter quite a bit. Much more than an umpire calling balls and strikes, you are in that sense a manager who is really setting the field with players to decide what the menu is going to be like.
So this power is really quite important, and it is crucial and it is important that we understand that when we look at your role in terms of your own description.
In recent times, the Supreme Court has received appeals in nearly 7,000 cases a year, and as you know, in recent times, the Supreme Court has heard only about 80 cases a year. In other words, the Justices choose to hear only about 1 percent of the appeals that they receive.
My question for you, Judge Roberts, is: Should you be confirmed, how will you decide which cases will make the cut and will be heard by the Supreme Court? And what will guide your complete discretion to choose which cases to hear?
Judge ROBERTS. I appreciate the question, Senator. It is an area where I will happily concede that the Justices are not acting just like umpires in deciding which cases they’re going to hear as opposed to how they’re going to decide them. My perspective has changed a little bit in this area. Certainly when I was practicing law, a lot of what I spent my time trying to do was get the Supreme Court to take a case. As you know, you file these things called petitions for certiorari, which are really quite extensive arguments about why the Court should hear your case, having really not that much to do with the merits, whether it was right or wrong, but just why the Court needs to issue an opinion in this area. And I thought they weren’t taking enough cases. When I became a court of appeals judge, I thought you didn’t need to have more cases taken up for review.
But the considerations, some are pretty well established. The job of the Supreme Court is to ensure the uniformity and consistency of Federal law, in particular, interpretations of the Constitution. So the clearest case that the Court should hear, they should grant certiorari on, as they say, is when two different courts of appeals are interpreting a law differently. Obviously, the law should mean the same thing in every part of the country, and if two different courts take a different view of the law, that’s the kind of case the Court ought to be taking.
I think the Court should, as a general matter—and, again, other Justices have expressed this view as well—grant review in cases in which a lower court strikes down an Act of Congress. I don’t think that’s an absolute rule, but certainly as a general matter, if an Act of Congress is going to be declared unconstitutional, I think the Supreme Court ought to be the one determining that as a final matter, and generally not leave it to a court of appeals.
So those are two categories: when there is a conflict, when an Act is found to be unconstitutional.
Beyond that—and this is where I agree with you the umpire analogy does not hold up—there is a lot of discretion in deciding whether it is the right time to grant review in a case. The people who practice before the Court talk about the Court letting an issue percolate a little bit, in other words, get more than just one or two

decisions from the courts of appeals, wait until others have had a chance to weigh in. The theory is that makes it more likely the Supreme Court will get it right if they have the benefit of several decisions from the lower courts rather than just one. Other cases the Justices determine that that’s not appropriate. It’s not appropriate to wait until the issue develops a little more; they want to look at it expeditiously. And it’s hard to lay down categorical rules in that area.
I have expressed the view—and it may be a view that I’ll have to be educated on further if I am confirmed, and I am not stating it as a solid view. I do think there is room for the Court to take more cases. They hear about half the number of cases they did 25 years ago. There may be good reasons for that that I will learn if I am confirmed, but just looking at it from the outside, I think they could contribute more to the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking more cases.
I have heard others say they could contribute to the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking fewer cases, but I don’t subscribe to that view. I think there is room for additional cases on the docket.
Senator KOHL. I think we agree that it is an enormous power, that power of decision. It is a very active power. It is not benign in any way. If Justices, for example, decide not to hear a case, whatever the merits, that is the final decision. Is that not correct?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s right. The decision of the court of appeals stands in that case. Now, it is true that I think the Justices generally look at their duty and obligation to ensure consistency in a fairly dispassionate and objective way. In other words, it doesn’t matter how a particular case came out. If it’s different in one part of the country than another, most of the Justices in my experience readily agree that that’s the kind of case they need to address.
Senator KOHL. I will just refer to two that were taken up without any reference from any lower court. One was Youngstown Sheet and Tube, which was, you know, the ability of the Government to seize a steel mill during a time of war. And, of course, another one that I’m interested in your comment on is Bush v. Gore, in which the Court decided to directly insert itself into a Presidential campaign. I am interested in not what happened after they decided to do that, but that the decision they made in terms of its propriety, its impact on the courts, the Court’s standing in the country, you must have thought about it, I am sure, a great deal when it happened.
I am sure you have an opinion on their decision to enter that case, and I think we would like to know what that opinion is.
Judge ROBERTS. You mentioned first the Youngstown case, and it is a category—and I think perhaps the Bush v. Gore case, that perhaps the Justices concluded it fell into that category. There are certain cases—they don’t come along all that often—that are, by their importance, significant enough for the Court to take. In other words, they don’t fit the description of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals or an Act of Congress held unconstitutional, but they are otherwise sufficiently important that the Court will grant review and take those cases.

338
Certainly, the Youngstown case was of that sort. It started out actually in the D.C. Court, the hearing was first there, and then the Court granted that. But the decision by a President to seize the steel mills based on—constitutionally, that’s an important enough issue you want the Supreme Court to issue a final ruling on that.
On the decision in Bush v. Gore and the determination of whether to grant review in that case, again, that’s not something that— you don’t know on what basis the Justices make a decision to grant review. You just get an order that says ‘‘review is granted.’’ In that case you had a decision of a State court that apparently the Justices thought should be reviewed, and obviously, expeditious treatment was needed, as I think it was in the Youngstown case as well. They’re capable of moving expeditiously when an important matter requires them to do so.
Senator KOHL. I asked you what your opinion of that decision was at that time.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s an area where I have not been—I have not felt free to comment, whether or not I agree with particular decisions or—
Senator KOHL. It is not likely to come up again. Judge ROBERTS. I do think that the issue about the propriety of Supreme Court review in matters of disputed electoral contests is a matter that could come up again. Obviously, the particular parameters in that case won’t, but it is a very recent precedent, and that type of decision is one where I thought it inappropriate to comment on whether I think they were correct or not. Senator KOHL. Judge Roberts, one of the most important constitutional events of our lifetime was the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Congress chose to exercise its role to advise, and in this case not to consent, based upon judicial philosophy and the strongly held opinions of the nominee. In effect, Congress told the President that we have an important role to play in the process as well. Do you believe that the Senate’s rejection of Judge Bork in 1987 was a reasonable and respectable act, or instead do you view it as a period of unfair partisanship? What were your thoughts about that case as it unfolded? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I don’t think it’s appropriate for me as a nominee to comment on the Senate’s treatment of other nominees, and I would respectfully decline to do that. Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Roberts, when we met a few weeks ago in my office, we discussed the Supreme Court’s recent property rights decision. In that case, Kelo v. the City of New London, the Court found it permissible under the Constitution for a city to seize private homes against the wishes of their owners so that a large pharmaceutical company could build a private industrial park and a research facility. A total of 15 homes were condemned, including a home lived in by an 87-year-old woman for her entire life, a home that her family had owned for over 100 years. Many people, including a majority I believe of people in my State, as well as myself, were quite disturbed by this ruling which appears to place much private property at risk by greatly expanding the eminent domain powers in local government.

339
We discussed this when you were in my office, and you told me that you were ‘‘surprised by the decision.’’ So could you expand on it a bit this afternoon and explain why you were surprised?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I did tell you that was my initial reaction. I remember hearing about the decision driving actually back from a Judicial Conference with another judge, and we all learn in law school, one of the first cases you study is called Calder v. Bull, has a basic proposition the Government cannot take property from A and give it to B. When I read the decision, I understood what the majority’s position was, the difficulty of drawing a line between things that are obviously public use like a railroad, a road, things that are traditionally the subject of the exercise of eminent domain, and other activities that are not as clearly within that range of course.
Justice O’Connor, in her dissent, thought that a line could be drawn between whether it was available to the public or not, and that certainly was available. The majority did say that it was not ruling on the starkest example, in other words, just determining to take the property from A to B because you think B could make better use of it. The issue arose, as you noted in your question, in the context of an urban renewal redevelopment project, and that may be limited to that context or may not.
I do know there’s been extensive legislative reaction to the decision. I know a number of States have passed laws already, saying, ‘‘We do not authorize the use of the power of eminent domain to take—for a use that’s going to be from one private owner to another,’’ and that’s certainly an appropriate reaction to the Court’s decision in this area.
What the Court is saying, what the majority is saying is because of the difficulty of drawing a line, this issue is really left up to the legislature, and if the legislature wants to draw the line in a particular place, it has that authority. But it certainly is a decision that was closely divided, 5–4, and it has gotten a lot of legislative reaction.
The point I would only make is that it’s perhaps a good example of the fact that legislatures, legislators have a responsibility to protect the rights of the people just as much as courts, and one way they can protect the rights of the people in this area, if they think it appropriate, is to restrict themselves in saying, ‘‘We will not use the eminent domain power to the broadest extent that the Supreme Court has said we are authorized to do.’’
Senator KOHL. Did I understand from your opinion on whether or not that case was correctly decided, or are you not—
Judge ROBERTS. No. Again, that’s—particularly since it’s an area they do specifically leave open the question about whether it applies outside of a redevelopment project. That’s an issue that could come before the Court. It’s not one I feel appropriate to comment on.
Senator KOHL. It would or it would not surprise you if we had not heard the last of that?
Judge ROBERTS. It’s certainly one of those areas that could come before the Court again, even in its present form. I know the author of the majority opinion has said it was an area where he, as a personal policy matter, wouldn’t have exercised that authority, but, of

340
course, the issue there was the legal issue, not policy preferences. It could come before the Court again, yes.
Senator KOHL. You will have a decision to make if it does rise up to that level. Is it possible that your decision, along with three other Justices, might be to put that on the docket?
Judge ROBERTS. That would be one of the decisions that in the exercise of the cert process, as they call it, short for the certiorari decision, and that would certainly be an issue that could come before the Court, and they already have, of course, four dissenters who may be anxious to revisit it or not. I don’t know. I don’t want to presume how they would view it on an ongoing basis.
Senator KOHL. Judge Roberts, I would like to talk a little bit about antitrust. I am the Ranking Member on the Antitrust Subcommittee. To me, antitrust is not some mysterious legal theory that only lawyers can talk about or understand. Antitrust is just another word for fair competition. The laws that we use to protect consumers and competitors from unfair and illegal trade practice is what antitrust is all about.
Do you agree that government enforcement of antitrust law is crucial to ensuring that consumers are protected from anticompetitive practices, such as price fixing and illegal maintenance of monopolies?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, I do, Senator. In fact, when I was in private practice, one of the cases I handled was the Microsoft antitrust case on behalf of government officials, the States in particular. A number of States retained me to argue that case before the D.C. Circuit en banc. So I certainly appreciate the role of governments, both State and Federal, in enforcing the protections of the antitrust laws, because as you know, there is concurrent authority in that area, the Sherman Act, of course, on the Federal level and then what people call the ‘‘Baby Sherman Acts’’ on the State level.
Senator KOHL. I am glad to hear you say that because on June 14, 1983, which is more than 20 years ago, in a memo to the White House Counsel Fred Fielding, you wrote, quote, ‘‘Enforcement of Federal rights is advanced most effectively by private suits in antitrust cases.’’ So isn’t it often true that individual consumers don’t have the resources to pursue these private suits against large corporations, and isn’t that why government enforcement of antitrust is essential? So you would, perhaps, not be feeling the same way today as you did 22 years ago when you made that comment?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think it depends on what area you’re talking about. I do think that the system established under the Sherman Act of private antitrust enforcement, and, of course, the opportunity to recover additional damages and attorneys’ fees and other aspects, has been an effective tool in enforcing the law. There are areas, as you mentioned. If the issue is mostly consumer rights as opposed to business rivals, government action may be more necessary in those areas as opposed to the others.
And I know that government antitrust regulators make those determinations every day, that their resources are best directed to areas where consumers or attorneys bringing class actions on consumers’ behalf, whatever the reasons were, the incentive system for private litigation may not be as effective, and that’s often the area

341
where State Attorneys General, the Justice Department, decide to get involved to supplement the private enforcement activity.
Senator KOHL. All right. I will just ask one more question before my time expires and that is on the important role that the Chief Justice plays as the head of the Judicial Conference, which is the organization of the entire Federal Judiciary. As head of the Judicial Conference, the Chief Justice makes policy recommendations as to legal reform, with respect to legal reform, reform of court procedures and advocates for the Federal courts.
What, if you are confirmed, would be your agenda, your plans, or your policy objectives to advance in connection with your role as the head of the Judicial Conference?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I am familiar with how the Judicial Conference operates for at least part of its role. I’ve been on the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules. I was there as a lawyer and I kept on as a judge. In fact, I was slated to be the Chairman of that Committee starting in October.
So I understand the role in promoting the forum of rules that apply in the Federal courts, both the appellate rules, the civil rules, criminal rules, and bankruptcy rules, and evidence rules, different committees there, and I’m familiar with the process. They go through the Advisory Committee, a broader Committee about rules in general. Then they’re submitted to the Judicial Conference for consideration, and it’s a very exhaustive process, but I think also a very responsive one. Particular problems are identified in practice by practitioners, by judges. They’re submitted to the committees. They review them. They come up with proposals. It’s a very important part of the functioning of the Federal system and it affects all the levels, not just the Supreme Court, of course, but courts of appeals and the trial courts.
Other issues of concern, obviously pressing issues, concerns with respect to security in light of different developments. Those are addressed at the Judicial Conference. Any need for legislative action that the courts feel is appropriate.
I have to tell you that if I were to be confirmed, as an initial matter, I think my primary posture is going to be one of listening because there’s obviously much I have to learn about matters of concern to different judges, different courts around the country, and that’s the good thing about the Judicial Conference, of course. They bring in judges from around the country to make sure that you get a national perspective on what needs to be done and you’re not just focused on issues here in Washington or anywhere else.
But it’s an area where I think I will have to listen a lot at the outset before being presumptuous enough to have a particular agenda.
Senator KOHL. I thank you, Judge Roberts. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kohl. Senator DeWine? Senator DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, good afternoon. Judge ROBERTS. Good afternoon.

Senator DEWINE. As you know, Judge, our Constitution created Federal courts with limited powers. In fact, Article III of the Constitution only gives the Federal courts the power to decide cases and controversies. This case and controversy requirement means that Federal courts will only hear real lawsuits involving real parties with real injuries. We have talked about this in the last several days.
This has led to the development of a number of different rules about when people can bring lawsuits in Federal court and when they cannot. One of these rules, as you well know, is the principle of standing.
You talked about this in 1993 in a law review article you wrote in the Duke Law Journal. You said the following, and I am going to quote briefly from this. ‘‘The legitimacy of an unelected lifetenured judiciary in our democratic republic is bolstered by the constitutional limitation of that judiciary’s power in Article III to actual cases and controversies.’’ You went on later to state the following. ‘‘The Article III standing requirement ensures that the court is carrying out its function of deciding a case or controversy rather than fulfilling the executive’s responsibility of taking care that the laws be faithfully executed,’’ end of quote.
Judge, could you elaborate on your statements today and maybe explain briefly what the doctrine of standing is and what that doctrine is really so important to our constitutional system?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, your question really brings—ties together a few things we’ve already touched on.
I don’t remember if it was you or someone else who referenced Justice White’s description of his obligation, what it was, and his answer was, ‘‘To decide cases.’’—
Senator DEWINE. That was me. Judge ROBERTS. And the basis for the institution of judicial review, as explained by Chief Justice John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison is similarly grounded on the obligation to decide cases and controversies, because if you look at the Constitution it doesn’t say in Article III that the judicial branch is established in order to tell us all what the Constitution means. It says that the judicial branch is established to decide cases and controversies arising under this Constitution and the laws. And that is the basis for the authority to interpret the Constitution. As Marshall explained, we have to decide a case. If the argument is that it’s inconsistent with the Constitution, we have to decide that. Therefore, we have that authority, and I believe that’s consistent with the intent of the Framers. But it does mean—and this is the point I was trying to make in that small little Law Review comment—that judges should be very careful to make sure they’ve got a real case or controversy before them, because that is the sole basis for the legitimacy of them acting in the manner they do in a democratic republic. They’re not accountable to the people. As judges they have the obligation to decide cases according to the rule of law. So first make sure you’ve got a real case, and a real case is not simply, you know, I’m interested in this area, I don’t like what the Government’s doing or I don’t like this law, and so I’m going to go to court. What the standing doctrine requires is that you actually

343
be injured by what the Government is doing, injured by Congress’s action. Now, the injury doesn’t have to be economic. The Supreme Court has explained in cases like Sierra Club v. Morton, it can be aesthetic, it can be environmental, it can cover a wide range of injuries, but you do have to show some injury that separates you from the general public, so you’re just not voicing a gripe, you’re trying to get a case decided. That’s the importance of the standing doctrine.
Senator DEWINE. Appreciate the explanation, Judge. Let me ask you a more personal question. Last time you appeared before our Committee you were a lawyer in private practice. Since that time you have spent approximately 2 years on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, a new experience for even a experienced practitioner like you. What surprised you about the last 2 years of judging?
Judge ROBERTS. Well— Senator DEWINE. If anything. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think I had the biggest surprise on the first day that I heard cases. Obviously, it’s opening day and the first day of my career, so I prepared as well as I could. And the arguments were great. And went into the conference room, and I had my notes and all the books. It’s just the judges, you know, just the three judges. We bring the record in. We’re surrounded by the U.S. reports, by our Court of Appeals reports, by the United States Code that you folks have written. And I was ready. I’m sitting there, and I remember the Chief Judge, who by tradition sits on a new judge’s first day, and he was there and another judge. And I waited a while, and I looked and they were still waiting. I waited a while longer, and they were still waiting. And finally, the Chief Judge advised me that the tradition was that the junior judge goes first at these discussions, and so I was kind of put on the spot right off the bat. And part of what that conference was like and throughout, really has—I don’t know if I’d say a surprise, but it’s been illuminating to me. The judges really do roll up their sleeves and try to find the right answer. It’s just the judges. But as we say, ‘‘Well, we think this case is controlled by the Smith case,’’ we get out the Smith case. We open it up and look at it, reading over each other’s shoulders and seeing exactly what it says. If somebody says, ‘‘Well, but in this case under the record there was no evidence about this or there was no objection raised about that,’’ well, you get out the record and you look, and there at page 223, you point to it and say, ‘‘Well, here’s where the objection was raised.’’ And the judges are very open. It’s a very encouraging part of the process from my point of view. Nobody goes in there with set views. They want the benefit of the collegial process, the benefit of each other’s views, and you have to be able to substantiate your position. There’s no place for rhetoric. People are pointing to the law, and I found that a very encouraging part of the process, what goes on in the conference room, which was of course a part of the process that I hadn’t participated in before. Senator DEWINE. That is something that we do not see either. Judge ROBERTS. Right. Senator DEWINE. No way of seeing that.

344
Judge ROBERTS. Right. And the positive part of that process to me was that nobody was invested in anything other than getting the right result, and they are prepared to be convinced, contrary to initial impressions, and I was as well. It’s, I found, a very encouraging part of the process.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, let me ask you—moving to the administrative law issue. As you know, in the 18th and 19th centuries we really did not have the governmental agencies that have such a profound influence, for better or worse, on the lives of Americans today, daily lives of Americans. Today administrative agencies set workplace safety rules, establish environmental regulations, lay down traffic safety standards, just to name a few things.
As far as I know there is no specific article in the Constitution dedicated to the administrative state that we live in today. In your view, what is there in the text or history of the Constitution that supports the growth of this administrative state that we live in? Is the growth of the administrative state an example of the Constitution being amended simply out of necessity, or is the administrative state consistent with the Constitution as drafted by our Founding Fathers? How do we get to where we are from a constitutional point of view?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, we all of course begin in high school civics with the notion of three branches of Government, the executive, the legislative and the judicial, and we study that. And then only occasionally do people look at the real world and say, ‘‘Well, what is this agency? What is that? Is that legislative or is that judicial or is that executive?’’ Of course, the answer is, well, it’s a little bit of each. It’s exercising power delegated by Congress. It’s executing it in a particular way. It’s issuing regulations that have the force and effect of law, and quite often it’s adjudicating particular disputes.
The activities of the administrative agencies are of course the bulk of what judges on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit do, and the principles of administrative law that have recognized the legitimacy of these agencies, and sought to ensure that their exercise of authority is consistent with constitutional provisions by basically—I mean I know the issue can seem arcane to many people, but the fundamentals of administrative law really go back to the basic principles of justice, is someone being given an opportunity to be heard? Is someone being treated fairly? Is someone who’s making a decision doing it for a rational reason or an arbitrary reason?
These are the same basic principles that have animated the common law system since the time of Lord Cook, and they are being applied here as well. The objection is often, ‘‘This agency made a decision without adequately hearing our concerns,’’ or ‘‘This agency made an adjudicatory decision without hearing the record evidence,’’ or ‘‘They did not explain.’’ That’s the basic requirement of administrative law, explain your decision. That’s the limitation on arbitrariness, and the agency didn’t explain why it’s doing this.
The notion that even in these arcane areas our legal system insists upon the observance of these basic requirements of—I don’t want to say due process as a technical term, but that’s the principle that is being applied. That goes a long way to explaining how
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00356 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

345
these agencies have been accepted into the constitutional system, because they have been required under principles of administrative law to comply with these basic precepts of procedural regularity.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, let me turn to the area of antitrust, a matter that is very important for the businesses and the consumers of this country. For over 100 years our antitrust laws have helped consumers by ensuring their economy is competitive and vibrant. Our antitrust laws are the oldest in the world, and many people, including me, think they are the best in the world. In fact, I am proud to say that John Sherman, Republican Senator from my own home State of Ohio, wrote the first antitrust law back in 1890.
Over the past 20 years we have achieved a great deal of consensus I think about how the antitrust laws should be enforced, Democrat and Republican administrations. As the Chair of this Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition, Policy and Consumer Rights, I have worked very closely with Senator Kohl who asked you some questions about antitrust. I think we have worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that consumers and competition are protected.
It is a simple goal, but it is not always easy to achieve or put into practice. For example, recently, the rise and expansion of the Internet and the technological explosion of the so-called new economy have led to a marketplace that is changing faster and more often than we have really ever experienced before.
Judge, what challenges do you think the courts face in trying to square our old antitrust laws as they are currently written with new business strategies and the high-technology markets, and do you think that these laws give courts enough guidance to deal with these new economy issues?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that was really the basic issue that I faced in the Microsoft case before the D.C. Circuit en banc. There was a lot of argument, academic commentary back and forth, the idea this is a whole new area. You can’t apply the old principles. They don’t work in this context. You need to do something different, the so-called new paradigm and all that.
At least the argument that I tried to make on behalf of the States was that the basic principles are the same. The Sherman Act was, as many have said, a charter of economic freedom and that those basic principles do have to be applied regardless of changes in the economics of the underlying businesses or the structure of the markets. Obviously, it requires a great deal of sensitivity on the part of the judges and it’s a really challenge for the lawyers sometimes to be able to understand the economics, to be able to explain them to the judges, and judges appreciate that.
But my basic instinct, and it’s nothing more than that, is that the principles are there and the issue is simply application in a new context.
Senator DEWINE. Good. Thank you. Judge, just one final comment. Yesterday, Senator Grassley asked you whether you think that there is, and I quote, ‘‘any room in constitutional interpretation for the judge’s own values or beliefs.’’ In response, you said, and I quote, ‘‘No, I don’t think there is. Sometimes it’s hard to give meaning to a constitutional term in a particular case. But you don’t

look to your own values and beliefs. You look outside yourself to other sources,’’ end of quote.
You continued by saying that, and I quote, ‘‘Judges wear black robes because it doesn’t matter who they are as individuals. That’s not going to shape their decision. It’s their understanding of the law that will shape their decision,’’ end of quote.
Now, Judge, I know what you meant by that answer. Judges should not impose their own preferences from the bench. In fact, I said pretty much the same thing in my opening statement on Monday.
But, Judge, putting on a black robe does not mean that a judge should lose his character. You, sir, have a perfect resume and certainly an outstanding professional career. But a Supreme Court Justice is more than just impeccable academic credentials and impressive accomplishments. President Bush nominated John Roberts, the man. America has gotten to know John Roberts, the man. And I am quite sure that the Senate is, in fact, going to confirm John Roberts, the man.
Over the past several months, we have examined your life, met with you in private, and now question you about your beliefs. Throughout this time, your honesty, your integrity, your wisdom, your judgment, and dare I say, yes, your values have shown through.
I would just say, sir, please don’t check any of that at the door when you walk into the Supreme Court. By becoming John Roberts, the Chief Justice, don’t ever forget to be John Roberts, the man.
I think this country needs you to remember how you got here and who you met along the way. We need you to bring to the Court your compassion and your understanding for the lives of others who haven’t been as successful as you have been. We need you to bring to the Court your strong commitment to equal justice for all. And we need you to always remember that your decisions will make a real difference in the lives of real people.
When you put on that black robe and assume your spot on the Supreme Court, you will surely bring with you your heart and your soul, the values you learned from your parents and others that you learned as you grew up in the wide open fields of your youth. Those values are strong, they are true. The President saw them when he nominated you and we have certainly seen them this week, and I must say, sir, that they must never leave you.
Justice Felix Frankfurter gave this same advice to his colleagues in 1949. ‘‘There comes a point,’’ Justice Frankfurter wrote, ‘‘where this Court should not be ignorant as judges of what we know as men.’’
Great Justices are more than just legal automatons, legal technicians. They are more than just that. And though they lose their individuality when they put on a black robe, great Justices never forget who they are. I wish you well. Thank you, sir.
Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator DeWine. Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

Judge, I subscribe to much of what Senator DeWine said. I want to tell you what I think perhaps a little differently and personally.
Senator Graham last night pointed out that Justice Scalia was confirmed by 98 votes of this body, and I thought then and I think now of how different the days were in 1986. There is so much water under the dam since then. The nation is divided. It is polarized. It is about 50–50. We are at war. Executive authority is very much on people’s minds. The law as it relates to war, the Geneva Conventions, Conventions Against Torture, all of these things are very much on everyone’s minds. We have seen in the last 10 years 193 five-to-four decisions of the Court, which suggests that on major questions, the Court is also very divided.
So in comes this young Justice. I was one on our side who voted for you for the D.C. Circuit Court. I did so because there were so many testimonials about what a fine lawyer you are, what a fine human being you are. And I voted for you, but there is more in this vote.
Senator DeWine just spoke about the man as opposed to the legal automaton. Yesterday morning, you spoke, I thought eloquently, in answering Senator Specter’s questions on Roe. You discussed stare decisis as fully as I have ever heard it discussed. I am not a lawyer. I learned a lot from listening to you. You discussed the right to privacy. You were very full and forward speaking. And then after lunch, it was as if you shut down and became very cautious.
So my first question, did anybody caution you between the morning and the afternoon sessions?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator. No. Senator FEINSTEIN. Has anyone, when you were being interviewed for this position, ever asked your opinion on Roe? Judge ROBERTS. No. Senator FEINSTEIN. Okay. That is good to know. From 1973 to 2005, 32 years, over three generations of women have come really to feel that finally they have some autonomy over their body. Women are all different. Many of them are very pro-life. Many are pro-choice. People have different religious views, moral views, so we have this big diverse population of women. The growth of women’s ability to succeed has been enormous, I mean, I went into the workforce at the same time Sandra Day O’Connor did with a year’s graduate work. The door was closed. It is now open and women are so lucky. And it seems to me that the living Constitution is that each person in this great country, man or woman, rich or poor, white or black, whatever it might be, can really reach their full potential. And I guess what has begun to concern me a little bit is Judge Roberts, the legal automaton, as opposed to Judge Roberts, the man, because I have heard so many times, ‘‘I can’t really say because it may come before me,’’ and yet I don’t expect you to say what you would do with Roe one way or another. But I do expect to know a little bit more about how you feel and how you think as a man, because you are a very young man to be Chief Justice. You could be Chief Justice for 40 years. That is a very long time.

And because of the division, and because there is also a lot of fear out there where this new Court, now with potentially two new Justices, is going to go, we want to know whether you have got the ability to bring the new Court together, to end the five-to-four decisions, to see that big decisions are made so that they represent a much greater consensus. I am trying to find out and see, are those qualities really there?
I was interested in a colloquy you had with Senator Biden on the end of life. He asked a number of legal questions and then says, okay, just talk to me as a father and tell me what you think. Now, I have been through two end-of-life situations, one with my husband, one with my father, both suffering terrible cancers, a lot of pain, enormous debilitation.
Let me ask this question this way. If you were in that situation with someone you deeply love and you saw the suffering, who would you want to listen to, your doctor or the government telling you what to do? To me, it is that stark because I have been through it.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, in that situation, obviously you want to talk and take into account the views and the heartfelt concerns of the loved one that you are trying to help in that situation because you know how they are viewing this. You know what they mean when they are saying things like what their wishes are and their concerns are. And, of course, consulting with their physician.
But it seems to me that in that situation, you do want to understand and make sure that you appreciate the views of the loved one, and only you can do it because—
Senator FEINSTEIN. That wasn’t my question. Judge ROBERTS. I’m sorry. Senator FEINSTEIN. I’m trying to see your feelings as a man. I am not asking you for a legal view— Judge ROBERTS. Well, I wasn’t trying to give a legal view. My point was that, obviously, you look to the views of the person involved, and if it’s a loved one, you are the one who is in a position to make sure that you understand their views and can help them communicate those— Senator FEINSTEIN. How would you feel if you were in that position? Judge ROBERTS. An end-of-life situation? You know, I do think it’s one of those things that it’s hard to conceptualize until you’re there. I really would be hesitant to say, this is what I would definitely want done or that is what I would definitely want done. You do need to confront that and appreciate all of the different concerns and impulses and considerations— Senator FEINSTEIN. And every situation is different. Judge ROBERTS. Yes. It’s one of those things, I think it’s difficult to put yourself in that position and say, well, with any degree of confidence, if I were suffering and confronting the end of life, this is what I would want to do, or that is what I would want to do. I just—you can theorize it and try to come up with your views or how you would— Senator FEINSTEIN. That is right. All I am saying is you wouldn’t want the government telling you what to do.

349
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’m happy to say that as a general matter—
Senator FEINSTEIN. That there should be a basic right of privacy. Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s getting into a legal question and you don’t want— Senator FEINSTEIN. Okay. I won’t go there. Let me go somewhere else. The Commerce Clause, the 14th Amendment, Lopez, which began a chain of about 36 cases striking down major pieces of legislation. It is not easy to get a bill passed here. I mean, there are hearings, there are discussions, there are markups. There is one House, there is another House, there is a President. It goes through most of the time scrubbed pretty good before it gets to the President. The Gun-Free Schools Zones Act was struck down in 1995, an impermissible use of the Commerce Clause. In 1996, Moses Lake, Washington, a shooting in a school. In 1997, Bethel, Alaska, principal and one student killed. In 1997, Pearl, Mississippi, two students killed and seven wounded by a 16-year-old. In 1997, West Paducah, Kenntucky, three students killed, five wounded. Stamps, Arkansas, two students wounded. Jonesboro, Arkansas, 1998, four students, one teacher killed, ten others wounded outside Westside Middle School. Edinborough, Pennsylvania, one teacher killed, two students, and on and on and on. An impermissible use of the Commerce Clause to prohibit possession of a weapon in and around schools. Now, at what point does crime influence commerce? Judge ROBERTS. I think it does, and one of the things that’s important to understand about the Lopez decision as the Court analyzed it, and again, I’m not taking a position on whether it was correctly decided or not— Senator FEINSTEIN. Right. Judge ROBERTS.—but as the Court analyzed it, one of the things about the Act is that it did not have what’s known as a jurisdictional requirement. It didn’t have a requirement that the firearm be transported in interstate commerce, a requirement that I would think it would be easy to meet in most cases because— Senator FEINSTEIN. But the firearm is transported in interstate commerce, maybe not when that student had it, but to get to the student, the firearm has been transported in interstate commerce. Judge ROBERTS. My point is that the fix in Lopez, all that the Court was saying was missing in there, or what was different about Lopez than many of the other cases was that lack of a jurisdictional requirement. And if the Act had been, as I understand the Court’s analysis, if the Act had required that, which I think, again, it’s fairly easy to show in almost every case—as you say, these guns are transported in interstate commerce—then that would have been within the Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. I think it was an unusual feature of the legislation that it didn’t have that requirement as so many laws do. As you know, it often says, you know, in interstate commerce, and that’s, at least as I understand the Lopez decision, what made it unusual. Senator FEINSTEIN. That is very helpful. You might get it back again someday with that fix.

Let me turn to something else that Senator Leahy asked a number of questions on, and that is the Constitution and Executive power. I am looking for the section, but the Constitution very clearly says that any treaty is treated as the supreme law of the land, right, and that no State or official can abrogate it—
Judge ROBERTS. Right. Senator FEINSTEIN.—which gives it the total weight of law. Can a President, then, decide not to follow a treaty? Judge ROBERTS. As a general matter, the answer is no. The treaty power—as long as it’s ratified according to the requirements in the Constitution, by two-thirds of the Senate, you’re perfectly correct. It is, under the Supremacy Clause, the supreme law of the land. Now, I don’t know if there are particular arguments about Executive authority in that area with which I’m not familiar, and I don’t mean to state categorically, but my general understanding is that treaties that are ratified—and, of course, we have treaties that aren’t ratified and Executive agreements that aren’t submitted for ratification and so on, but a treaty that’s ratified by the Senate under the Supremacy Clause is part of the supreme law of the land. Now— Senator FEINSTEIN. So the Conventions Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions would apply? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Now, there are questions, of course, that arise under those and have arisen under those about interpreting the Conventions and how they apply in particular cases to non-parties to the Convention and so on, and as you know, those cases have been coming up and are being litigated. But that’s an issue of what the Convention means in a particular case, not whether, as a general matter, a treaty is binding. Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me take you to yesterday morning and stare decisis, because you specifically discussed, when you were asked about Roe and Casey, precedent, workability, reliance, pragmatic considerations, changed facts or circumstances, and whether the underlying legal or constitutional doctrine would still be valid. Are there any other factors that you think should be considered? Judge ROBERTS. Well, the Court has been somewhat inconsistent on some other factors. They, for example, talk about in some cases the length of a precedent, the idea that the longer it’s been on the books, the more people have conformed their conduct to it. In other cases, they’ve suggested that’s not such an important consideration. In Payne v. Tennessee, the case that it noted how closely divided the Court was in the prior case as a factor, but in other cases the Court has said that’s not a major consideration. So I put those factors on the table simply because in some cases, the Court looks to them. In others, it doesn’t. But I think the ones I mentioned yesterday are ones that apply in every case, including the settled expectations, the workability, whether the doctrinal basis of a decision had been eroded. Senator FEINSTEIN. Yesterday, in answering Senator Specter on this very point, when you referred to Payne v. Tennessee, you did point out there were other considerations that come into play and they are laid out again in Dickerson and in other cases, Payne v.

Tennessee, Agostini, and a variety of decisions where the Court has explained when it will revisit a precedent and when it will not.
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator FEINSTEIN. When do you think it should and should not? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I do think you do have to look at those criteria, and the ones that I pull from those various cases are, first of all, the basic principle that it’s not enough that you think the decision was wrongly decided. That’s not enough to justify revisiting it. Otherwise, there’d be no role for precedent, no role for stare decisis. Second of all, one basis for reconsidering it is the issue of workability. If a precedent has turned out not to provide workable rules, if courts get different results in similar cases because they— Senator FEINSTEIN. Or if another case like Casey finds that Roe is workable— Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, that’s a different—that is a precedent of its own— Senator FEINSTEIN. Right. Judge ROBERTS.—that obviously would be looked at under principles of stare decisis. The issue of the erosion of precedent, if you have a decision that’s based on three different cases and two of them have been overruled, maybe that’s a basis that justifies revisiting the prior precedent. The issue of settled expectations, the Court has explained you look at the extent to which people have conformed their conduct to the rule and have developed settled expectations in connection with it. Perhaps the discussion earlier we had about the Dickerson case is as good example of that, where the Chief Justice just thought Miranda was wrongly decided, but explained that it had become part of the established rules of police conduct and he was going to respect those expectations. Senator FEINSTEIN. Now, yesterday, you said this. ‘‘I agree with the Griswold Court’s conclusion that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that. The Court since Griswold has grounded the privacy right discussed in that case in the liberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause.’’ Do you think that right of privacy that you are talking about there extends to single people as well as married people? Judge ROBERTS. The courts held that in the Eisenstadt case, which came shortly after Griswold, largely under principles of equal protection, and I don’t have any quarrel with that conclusion in Eisenstadt. Senator FEINSTEIN. Okay. Do you think that that same right extends beyond family choices then about a child’s education? Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s where it actually got started 80 years ago, in the earliest cases. Meyer and Pierce involved questions about how to raise children, whether you could teach them a foreign language, whether you could send them to a private school. And those decisions are really what started that body of law. Senator FEINSTEIN. I have another question I could ask, but you won’t answer it, unless— Senator LEAHY. Give it a try, Dianne. Go ahead.

[Laughter.] Senator FEINSTEIN. Does it cover the right of a woman to decide whether to continue her pregnancy? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, as I’ve explained, that is an area— Senator FEINSTEIN. That could come before you—right. That message has been well conveyed. Could I ask you one question? I think I will have time. In Acree v. Republic of Iraq, this was the case where 17 U.S. prisoners— Americans—suffered severe beatings, starvation, mock executions, dark and unsanitary living conditions, et cetera, during the First Gulf War. And they sued the Government of Iraq, the Iraqi Intelligence Services, and Saddam Hussein for their brutal and inhumane treatment. The veterans won their case in district court in July of 2003. They were awarded $959 million in damages. After the judgment, the Justice Department intervened in the suit to contest the district court’s jurisdiction. The specific issue involved a statutory interpretation of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act passed in 2003. Justice argued that the statute gave the President the authority to change Iraq’s designation as a state sponsor of terror and thereby relieve it after the fact of its responsibilities for prior acts of terror. You wrote a concurring opinion in favor of overturning the district court’s judgment. Although you agreed with the other two judges on the panel that the judgment should be reversed, you alone adopted the Department of Justice’s argument that the statute granted the President total power to absolve Iraq of liability. You reached this conclusion while acknowledging that the question of statutory interpretation is close. May I ask my question? Chairman SPECTER. Yes, you may finish your question. Senator FEINSTEIN. Do you believe that when, as in Acree, there is a close question of interpretation of a statute touching upon a foreign policy that the Executive deserves total deference? Judge ROBERTS. Oh, no, Senator. Whether the question is close or not, I don’t think there’s any situation where a court concludes that the Executive deserves total deference, and that was not the basis of my decision. The judges were unanimous that the veterans were not entitled to relief. The panel was chosen from what happened to be appointees of three different Presidents. The view was unanimous that they were not entitled to relief. The other two judges concluded there was no cause of action available to them. I concluded that there was no jurisdiction and wrote separately. The recognition that it was a close question is also reflected in the view of the other two judges in addressing my concern. They acknowledged that it was a close question, and I agreed with that. But you did have legislation that said that the President can determine that these laws do not apply if he makes a determination under the criteria set forth in the statute, and he had done that, and my conclusion that that extended to the provision that otherwise would have allowed suit. The other two judges disagreed. They thought there was jurisdiction, but then concluded there was no right of action. So the end

result of both of our positions was the same. But it was not a question of deference. It was a question of interpreting the legal authority and consequences of an Act that this body had passed and the President’s finding under that. When it comes to interpreting questions of law, I go back to Marbury v. Madison. That is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial branch. We don’t defer to the Executive. We don’t defer to the legislature in making that final decision about what the law is.
Senator FEINSTEIN. If you get confirmed, maybe you will defer to the legislative a little bit. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge ROBERTS. Just to clarify, we certainly defer in the standards of review to make sure that we’re not—but the final decision about what’s constitutional or not rests with the judicial branch. The policy judgments, we certainly defer to the legislature. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your leadership as we move forward expeditiously, I think, today and I think in a helpful way. I think the hearings have been very good and, Judge Roberts, I salute you for your excellent manner and your forthrightness and professionalism as you answer these questions. You know, I hope we are moving away, Senator Feinstein, from divisiveness. In some ways, we do have a divided country. But in other ways, I think we have the potential to move together, and I frankly believe that one thing that causes divisiveness and frustration and angst is when the Supreme Court were to render an opinion that really is more a political or social policy decision rather than a legal decision. And when they say it amounts to the Constitution, a constitutional provision, then that Supreme Court opinion can only be changed by two-thirds of both Houses and threefourths of the States. Do you understand that danger, Judge Roberts, in opinions? And is that perhaps one reason you think a judge should show modesty? Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s part of what I mean when I say a certain humility should characterize the judicial function. Judges need to appreciate that the legitimacy of their action is confined to interpreting the law and not making it. And if they exceed that function and start making the law, I do think that raises legitimate concerns about legitimacy of their authority to do that. Senator SESSIONS. Well, I would observe that the American people are beginning to believe that is occurring, and I think it does threaten legitimacy of the Court in a way that all of us who love the law should be concerned. And I do love the law, and I am a big critic of the courts on these kinds of activist cases. But I have practiced full-time before Federal judges, and as I said earlier, I believe day after day justice is done. You have said that before your court you are impressed with the objectivity and fairness that the judges bring. Is the ideal of blindfold justice, a neutral umpire, is that a romantic, naive ideal, or is that something that you believe we can and should strive to achieve in America?

Judge ROBERTS. Well, I do know that there are sophisticated academic theorists, people who spend a lot more time theorizing in this area than I do, and a lot smarter than I am addressing these issues who—some of whom conclude that in particular cases it’s difficult to do, it’s difficult to avoid making the law while you’re interpreting it, and they kind of throw up their hands and suggest that we shouldn’t even try, therefore.
I don’t agree with that. I think as a practical matter, as a pragmatic matter, judges every day know the difference between interpreting the law and making the law. Every day judges put aside their personal views and beliefs and apply the law. Whether the result is one they would agree with as a legislator or not agree with, the question is what the law is, not what they think it should be.
I’ve seen that on the court of appeals. I’ve seen that as a practicing lawyer before the court. That is the ideal. I’m sure judges, I’m sure Justices don’t always achieve it in every case because it’s a human endeavor and error is going to infect any human endeavor. But that is the ideal, and I think good judges working hard can not only achieve it but also achieve it together in a collegial way and benefit from the insight and views of each other.
Senator SESSIONS. Well, I thank you for that, and I would share those views. And I absolutely believe the strength of our Nation is our good legal system.
We have talked about the Commerce Clause, and there has been a lot of criticism of some of the cases. I think there have only been two significant Commerce Clause cases maybe in the last 40 years: Lopez and Morrison. Senator Feinstein and you had a nice exchange about Lopez. I would certainly agree with your analysis. Had the Congress placed in there a requirement that the firearm had been traveled in interstate commerce, I believe that statute would have been upheld. We could pass it again with that simple requirement, and virtually every firearm will have traveled in interstate commerce. A few States have manufacturers. When I was a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted a lot of those cases. As a young prosecutor, I was sort of an expert at it in the 1970s, and I proved sometimes the interstate commerce by simply putting an agent on saying there was no gun manufacturer in Alabama, or it said ‘‘Made in Italy’’ on it. I remember I got that affirmed one time as proof beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not made in Alabama. So Lopez, I believe, is a good decision.
Also with regard to crime, I would note that we have always had that nexus with interstate commerce. As a Federal prosecutor, it is not prosecution for theft. It is prosecution for interstate transportation of stolen property. That is the Federal crime. Theft is prosecuted only by the State courts, unless it is theft from an interstate shipment. That is a Federal crime. It is not stealing an automobile. It is interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle. ITSMV is the Federal crime.
The Hobbs Act, the Extortion Act to use against politicians, you have to have an interstate nexus.
And I have had cases where bribery was proven but we were not able to prosecute it federally because it did not have an interstate nexus. RICO, even arson cases have to have it there. So I just want to make sure that if—

355
Let me ask you this. In general, would you not agree that if someone in Pennsylvania picks up a rock and murders their neighbor, that is a crime unreachable by Federal prosecution under traditional interpretations of Commerce Clause and the reach of the Federal Government?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, barring special circumstances of the sort you were talking about, that’s generally something addressed by State authorities.
Senator SESSIONS. But we need to get this thing straight. We have some people complaining we are federalizing too many crimes and then complain that we are striking down some that go too far. States should prosecute these cases locally and effectively and should do that, schools and guns and that kind of thing. And in the Violence Against Women Act, there was a Commerce Clause case where a woman was raped and then sued the people who assaulted her and raped her. She wanted to sue in Federal court under the Violence Against Women Act. And what the Court held there was, as I read it, that the Court limited Congress’s power to provide for civil damages, money damages. She could sue that rapist in State court, but not for money damages in Federal court. Is that the holding of that case?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s my understanding of what the Court held in the Morrison case, yes.
Senator SESSIONS. And I don’t think it is an utterly extreme position. It certainly did not gut the Violence Against Women Act. It has so many more provisions than just that. If the action had been against a private business, could the damages have been rendered in that case?
Judge ROBERTS. I’m not sure I know the answer to that, Senator. Senator SESSIONS. I will take the follow-up on the Garrett case that several people have mentioned. It involved the University of Alabama in a lawsuit against the State institution, claiming violation of the disabilities act. The State defended on the grounds that you could sue the State of Alabama for backpay; you could sue the State of Alabama to get your job back; you could sue the State of Alabama and get an injunction against the State to not discriminate again in the future; but under the Sovereign Immunity doctrine that protects a State from lawsuits, you couldn’t sue them for money damages. Now-Senator Cornyn as attorney general of his State and attorneys general like Attorney General, now-Judge Bill Pryor, who defended Alabama, raised that defense. And I do not think it is a bogus defense. I think it is a legitimate concern. Judge, do you recall where the doctrine that is so famous in the law—that the power to sue is the power to destroy—do you remember where that came from in legal our legal history? Judge ROBERTS. I remember tax opinions talking about it, the power to tax being the power to destroy, but— Senator SESSIONS. I think the doctrine has been applied to the States, so we attorneys general are familiar with it under the sovereign immunity that the States have. If you are empowered to sue the State of Alabama in Federal court, then you have virtually the power to destroy that State financially, if there is no real limit on it. And so we have always provided and the States have provided

a sovereign immunity that the States will only allow themselves to be sued under certain circumstances and you cannot just sue them unnecessarily.
I know Senator Mark Pryor, our Democratic colleague, signed on the brief for the State of Alabama in the Garrett case taking this position, and the Supreme Court ruled with it. I also would note that it did not in any way destroy the disabilities act. It applied to only—State employees only make up about 3.7 percent of the employees in the Nation that might be covered by that.
So I think that there have been some healthy trends in reestablishing that there is some limit to reach of the Commerce Clause. Would not you agree?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the interesting thing, the Court’s most recent decision is the medical marijuana decision in the Raich case. And the Court there looked at the Lopez and Morrison decisions and tried to put them in context and said—because the argument there was based on Lopez and Morrison, saying this is beyond Congress’s power, and the Court said those are only two of our cases and they need to be put in the broad sweep of Commerce Clause precedents for over 200 years. Yes, they are two cases and it had been, I think, 65, 70 years since the Court had focused on limitation under the Commerce Clause and concluded that it was beyond Congress’s power. But the Raich case concluded this was within Congress’s power. They said don’t—it’s not as if Lopez and Morrison are junking all that came before. They just need to be considered in a broad context.
And of course there’s decision after decision, going back to Gibbons v. Ogden, one of Chief Justice John Marshall’s early opinions, about the scope of Congress’s power and the recognition under the constitutional scheme that it is a broad grant of power, and the recognition that this body has the authority to determine when issues affecting interstate commerce merit legislative response at the Federal level. I think that’s—
Senator SESSIONS. Well, I think you are—just to go on to another subject, but I think you are correct. These are some difficult areas and the courts need to give a lot of attention to. But some recognition that there are limits to Federal reach is, I think, legitimate for a court.
Judge, are you aware of the salary that you will be paid when you become—if you are so fortunate?
Judge ROBERTS. In a vague way, yes. Senator SESSIONS. And I suppose you were when you were affirmed to the court of appeals? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SESSIONS. So you are not going to be back next week asking for a pay raise, are you? Judge ROBERTS. Not next week, no. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. The Chief was always over here knocking on our door about pay raises. But, you know, we have a deficit in our country— [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS.—and you are paid the same—I guess the Chief may be paid more than Senators, but for the most part

judges are paid what Members of Congress are paid. And I frankly am dubious that we should give ourselves big pay raises when we can’t balance the budget.
I also chair the Court Subcommittee, Courts and Administration, and as Chief you have a serious responsibility with regard to managing and providing guidance to the Congress on the needs of the court system. I know that—I am sure that you will do that with great skill and determination. But let me ask you, will you also seek to manage that court system—and I hesitate, but I will use the word ‘‘bureaucracy’’ at times—effectively and efficiently and keep it a lean and effective management team and maintain as tight a budget as you can maintain?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, if I am confirmed, Senator, the answer is yes. I am aware that there is, for example, the Administrative Office, and they provide valuable services to judges around the country. As a consumer of their services for the past 2 years, I have, certainly, particular views about where I think they’re effective and helpful to judges and other areas where, like any bureaucracy, where I think they can do better. It is an area where my first priority is going to be to listen, because I’m sure there are many considerations of which I’m not aware that are very important for the Chief Justice to take into account. And after listening, I’ll try to make the best decisions I can about administering that system.
Senator SESSIONS. Well, there are a lot of problems. Judges are not happy with the General Services Administration and sometimes GSA is not happy with the judges, and sometimes judges overreach and want to be treated awfully specially. So I think you have a challenge there. I would look forward to working with you. If you will help us make sure that your court system is lean and efficient and productive, we will try to make sure that you have sufficient resources to do those jobs.
One more thing I would just like to inquire about, and that deals with stare decisis, the deference you give to a prior decision of the Supreme Court. And you mentioned a number of factors, and I recognize those as valid and worthy of great consideration. But it almost strikes me that it is a bit circular. In other words, the Court is creating a wall around its opinions to try to avoid seeing them overruled. Isn’t it true that your first oath is to enforce the Constitution, as God gives you the ability to understand it, and that sometimes decisions have to be reversed if they are contrary to a fair and just reading of the Constitution?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator. The oath we take is to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. That’s true. And the way judges go about that is within a system of precedent and, consistent with rules of stare decisis, no judge starts the day by opening a blank slate and saying what should the Constitution mean today? We operate within those systems of precedence. That’s the best way that judges have determined to interpret the Constitution and laws, consistent with principles of stare decisis.
Senator SESSIONS. Judge, I will just conclude with noting that I remember when the court in the Ninth Circuit ruled that striking down the Pledge of Allegiance, then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle came to the floor, as now-Minority Leader Harry Reid did the same afternoon, and they criticized the opinion and criticized the Ninth

Circuit and expressed concern about activism in that circuit, which I have done often myself.
But I responded that my concern was not so much with the circuit but with the confusing number of opinions from the Supreme Court and that I had no doubt that there was Supreme Court authority that would justify the Ninth Circuit rendering, or ruling, that they did. And I say that because we have just received word today that a judge in San Francisco has upheld—has ruled that the Pledge’s reference to one Nation under God violates the Constitution and should be stricken down. So that case is going to be winding its way forward.
I am not going to ask you to comment on it because it will obviously come before you. But will you tell us whether or not you are concerned about the inconsistencies of these opinions, and will you work to try to establish a body of law in the Supreme Court that recognizes the Free Exercise rights of American citizens in regard to religion and to avoid a state establishment of a religion?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, we talked about this in the Committee hearings on a couple of occasions, and I think everyone would agree that the religion jurisprudence under the First Amendment, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause could be clearer. The Ten Commandments cases are the example right at hand. You have two decisions of the Supreme Court. Only one Justice thinks both are right. That is an area in which I think the Court can redouble its efforts to try to come to some consistency in its approach.
Now, it obviously is an area that cases depend in a very significant way on the particular facts, and any time that’s the case the differences may be explained by the facts. You do have the two provisions, as your question recognized, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. And as I’ve said before, I think that both of those are animated by the principle that the Framers intended, the rights of full citizenship to be available to all citizens without regard to their religious belief or lack of religious belief. That I think is the underlying principle, and hopefully, the Court’s precedents over the years will continue to give life to that ideal.
Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Judge Roberts. You have, by your testimony, validated the high opinions that so many have of you. I am confident you would make a great Chief Justice.
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Senator Feingold. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, let me start off by talking about a couple of new topics. In September 1985 when you were in the White House Counsel’s Office, you recommended deleting the following line from the Presidential briefing materials, quote: ‘‘As far as our best scientists have been able to determine, the AIDS virus is not transmitted through casual or routine contact.’’ You said at the time that the conclusion was in dispute. We now know of course that the line is completely accurate, but I would say we also knew that then. The Centers for Disease Control guidelines issued the month before you wanted to delete that line said the following, ‘‘Casual person-to-person contact as would occur among schoolchildren appears

to pose no risk.’’ Major news organizations had reported the CDC’s conclusion. In fact, the CDC had said as early as 1982 that it was unlikely that HIV could be spread through casual contact.
Judge ROBERTS. I’m sorry. As early as when? Senator FEINGOLD. As 1982, that it was unlikely that HIV could be spread through casual contact. Why did you recommend that that line be deleted? Judge ROBERTS. Well, for the reason I gave in the memorandum. This was a statement by the President, and I just wanted to— didn’t want the President giving out medical advice if it was the subject of some uncertainty. I obviously was not a medical expert, and you said the CDC had issued a report a month before. Well, earlier in your commentary—I don’t know what the 1982 issue was—but I just thought it was—it’s purely a matter of caution and prudence to have the President make a pronouncement on a—you have to remember this was at the very beginning of the AIDS coming into public consciousness, and I was just concerned that the President not be giving out medical statements if people weren’t absolutely sure that it was correct. Senator FEINGOLD. Let me follow that a little bit. It certainly was an early time and also a critical time. I am wondering what you did to check or have someone check on these facts. I mean you must have known that the issue was so important the President was saying something like this, that it could have given great reassurance to people all over the country, as well as helping children infected with the AIDS virus to live happier and more normal lives to know that this was the medical conclusion. So I am just wondering why you would not check it out a little bit. Judge ROBERTS. I mean I—the flip side of that, Senator, of course, is if it turned out to be wrong, it could have been disastrous to have the President announcing—because the President wasn’t a medical expert either—and I’m sure my suggestion would have caused the people drafting the President’s speech to go back, and if they thought they were convinced and they were sure, then that’s what would have gone in there. It was just a question of concern. I wanted to make sure that they were 100 percent confident that what the President was going to be saying about a medical issue was they had complete confidence in it. I don’t know actually whether they took it out or left it in, but at least it caused them to focus— Senator FEINGOLD. I do not want to belabor it, but I think that was a great opportunity for Presidential leadership and reassurance, and I would just respectfully disagree with your judgment there. Judge ROBERTS. Well, my judgment—just so I could—it wasn’t my medical judgment. The impact of my suggestion was, obviously to cause to people who wanted that in there to go back and make sure they were sure that they wanted the President of the United States issuing a medical statement. Senator FEINGOLD. I think it was pretty certain at that time what the medical view as, as indicated by the medical community of our Government, but I will leave it at that.

Do you believe that the Congress has the power under the Constitution to prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians in employment?
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t know if that’s an issue that’s going to come before the courts. I don’t know if Congress has taken that step yet, and until it does, I think that’s an issue that I have to maintain some silence on. I think personally I believe that everybody should be treated with dignity in this area, and respect. The legal question of Congress’s authority to address that though is one that could come before the courts, and so I should be—
Senator FEINGOLD. Can you imagine an argument that would be contrary to that view?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t know what arguments people would make. I just know that I shouldn’t be expressing an opinion on an issue that could come before the Court.
Senator FEINGOLD. Let us go to something else then. I would like to hear your views about the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms. This is an amendment where there is a real shortage of jurisprudence. You mentioned the Third Amendment, where there is even less jurisprudence, but the Second Amendment is close. So I think you can maybe help us understand your approach to interpreting the Constitution by saying a bit about it.
The Second Amendment raises interesting questions about a constitutional interpretation. I read the Second Amendment as providing an individual right to keep and bear arms as opposed to only a collective right. Individual Americans have a constitutional right to own and use guns, and there are a number of actions that legislatures should not take in my view to restrict gun ownership. The modern Supreme Court has only heard one case interpreting the Second Amendment. That case is U.S. v. Miller. It was heard in 1939. The Court indicated that it saw the right to bear arms as a collective right. In a second case, in U.S. v. Emerson, the Court denied cert and let stand a lower court opinion that upheld a statute banning gun possession by individuals subject to a restraining order against a Second Amendment challenge. The appeals court viewed the right to bear arms as an individual right. The supreme court declined to review the appeals court decision.
So what is your view of the Second Amendment? Do you support one of the other of the views of what was intended by that amendment?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I mean you’re quite right that there is a dispute among the circuit courts. It’s really a conflict among the circuits. The Fifth Circuit—I think it was in the Emerson case if I’m remembering it correctly—agreed that—with what I understand to be your view, that this protects an individual right. But they went on to say that the right was not infringed in that case. They upheld the regulation there.
The Ninth Circuit has taken a different view. I don’t remember the name of the case now, but a very recent case from the Ninth Circuit has taken the opposite view that it protects only a collective right, as they said. In other words, it’s only the right of a militia to possess and not an individual right.
Particularly since you have this conflict, cert was denied in the Emerson case, I’m not sure it’s been sought in the other one or will
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00372 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

361
be, that’s the sort of issue that’s likely to come before the Supreme Court when you have conflicting views. I know the Miller case sidestepped that issue. An argument was made back in 1939 that this provides only a collective right, and the Court didn’t address that. They said instead that the firearm at issue there—I think it was a sawed-off shotgun—is not the type of weapon protected under the militia aspect of the Second Amendment.
So people try to read into the tea leaves about Miller and what would come out on this issue, but that’s still very much an open issue.
Senator FEINGOLD. I understand that a case could come before you. I am wondering if you would anticipate that in such a case that a serious question would be, which interpretation is correct?
Judge ROBERTS. Anytime you have two different courts of appeals taking opposite positions, I think you have to regard that as a serious question. That’s not expressing a view one way or the other. It’s just saying, I know the Ninth Circuit thinks it’s only a collective right; I know the Fifth Circuit thinks it’s an individual right; and I know the job of the Supreme Court is to resolve circuit conflicts, so I do think that issue is one that’s likely to come before the Court.
Senator FEINGOLD. I would like to revisit the Hamdi issue. I asked you which of the four opinions in the case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld best approximates your view on the Executive’s power to designate enemy combatants, and you refused to answer that question because the issue might return to the Court. I want to press you a bit on that. In Hamdi there were four different opinions. And by the way, I checked it because you mentioned Youngstown, and all four opinions cited the Youngstown Sheet and Tube v. Sawyer case. Both Justice Thomas’s dissent and Justices Ginsburg’s and Souter’s concurring opinion, cited Justice Jackson’s opinion in the Youngstown case. And they came to completely different conclusions.
So your answer that you would apply that principle does not help me very much in understanding your view of this. We know where all 8 other members of the Court stand on these opinions. In their opinions, they either wrote or joined one of them, yet all 8 of them will hear the next case that raises similar issues. No one is suggesting that their independence or impartiality in the next case has been compromised.
Mr. Hamdi, of course, has left the country, so the precise facts of his case will never return to the Court. Of course, if a member of the Court expressed a view outside of the Court on a specific case that was headed to the Court, that might be cause for recusal, as Justice Scalia recognized when he recused himself from the Pledge of Allegiance case a few terms ago after discussing it in a speech. But obviously, Justice Scalia can participate in the next case involving the questions at issue in Hamdi even though we know exactly what he thinks about that decision.
So I guess I want to know why are you different? I am not asking for a commitment on a particular case. I recognize that your views might change once you are on the Court and hear the arguments and discuss the issue with your colleagues, but why should not the public have some idea of where you stand today on these crucial questions concerning the power of the Government to jail them

without charge or access to counsel in a time of war? They know a great deal about how each of the other Justices approach these issues. Why is your situation different?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, because each of the other 8 Justices came to their views in those cases through the judicial process. They confronted that issue with an open mind. They read the briefs presented by the arguments—by the parties, and the arguments the parties presented. They researched the precedents as a judge. They heard the argument in the case. They sat in the conference room, just the 9 of them on the Court, and debated the issues and came to their conclusions as part of the judicial process.
You’re now asking me for my opinion outside of that process, not after hearing the arguments, not after reading the briefs, not after the participating with the other judges as part of the collegial process, not after sitting in the conference room and discussing with them their views, being open to their considered views of the case, not after going through the process of writing an opinion, which I have found from personal experience and from observation, often leads to a change in views, the process of the opinion writing. You can’t—the opinion turns out it doesn’t write. You have to change the result. The discipline of writing helps lead you to the right result.
You’re asking me for my views, you know, right here without going through any of that process.
Senator FEINGOLD. What would be the harm, Judge, if we got your views at this point, and then that process caused you to come to a different conclusion, as it appropriately should? What would be the harm?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the harm would be affecting the appearance of impartiality in the administration of justice. The people who would be arguing in that future case should not look at me and say, ‘‘Well, there’s somebody who under oath testified that I should lose this case because this is his view that he testified to.’’ They’re entitled to have someone consider their case through the whole process I’ve just described, not testifying under oath in response to a question at a confirmation hearing.
I think that is the difference between the views expressed in the prior precedent by other Justices in the judicial process and why— as has been the view of all of those Justices—every one of those Justices who participated in that case took the same view with respect to questions concerning cases that might come before them, as I am taking here.
Senator FEINGOLD. I understand your view. I think it is narrow. I had the experience of having one of my bills go before the Supreme Court, and I know I did not have, as we say in Wisconsin, a snowball’s chance with a couple of the Justices because of what they had ruled previously, but I did not think that made the process in any way tainted. I knew that they simply were not going to agree with the statute, but I recognize your limitations.
Let me ask you about something else, the Hamdan matter. Yesterday you refused to answer any questions regarding your conduct in the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld case. But today you answered questions from Senator Coburn regarding this matter. So I want to follow up in order to make sure the record is complete.

You interviewed with the Attorney General of the United States concerning a possible opening on the Supreme Court on April 1, 2005. Is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. The specifics of the details I’ve discussed in the response to the Committee’s questionnaire.
Senator FEINGOLD. That was 6 days before the oral argument in the Hamdan case, is that not right?
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t remember the exact date of it. I know it was shortly before that, yeah.
Senator FEINGOLD. You had further interviews on May 3rd concerning a possible appointment to the Court with numerous White House officials including Karl Rove, the Vice President and the White House Counsel before the decision in the Hamdan case was released; is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. The decision was June 15th. Senator FEINGOLD. The question here is just did you have further interviews on May 3rd concerning a possible appointment to the Court? Judge ROBERTS. May 3rd, yes. But whatever was—I don’t remember the exact dates, but whatever was— Senator FEINGOLD. But you had interviews with those individuals— Judge ROBERTS.—in the Senate questionnaire. Senator FEINGOLD. The questionnaire seems to indicate it was on May 3rd. You met again with Ms. Miers, the White House Counsel on May 23rd; is that right? Judge ROBERTS. I’m relying on the—if that’s what I said in the questionnaire, yes. I don’t have an independent recollection. Senator FEINGOLD. You have no reason to doubt that those facts are correct. You never informed counsel in this case of these meetings, did you? Judge ROBERTS. I did not, no. Senator FEINGOLD. Mr. Gonzales’s advice to the President concerning the Geneva Conventions was an issue in the case, isn’t that right? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t want to discuss anything about what’s at issue in the case. The case is still pending, and pending before the Supreme Court. Senator FEINGOLD. How about this one. President Bush was named a defendant in the case, right? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. In his official capacity. Senator FEINGOLD. The Hamdan decision was released on July 15th. Is it your testimony that no work on that decision took place after July 1? Judge ROBERTS. No. I didn’t—that was not my testimony. The opinions in the D.C. Circuit— Senator FEINGOLD. Is it your testimony now that no work on that decision took place after July 1? Judge ROBERTS. Opinions in the D.C. Circuit are complete and circulated to the panel a week before they’re released. That was my—the conclusion of when work was complete, and again, I wasn’t the author of the opinion—it would have been a week before it was released.

Senator FEINGOLD. Did you read over the opinion of the concurrence after July 1? Was there any editing that took place after that date?
Judge ROBERTS. I don’t recall, Senator, and— Senator FEINGOLD. Well, when was the issue of whether you should recuse yourself from this case, when did that first come to your attention? Judge ROBERTS. I saw, was made aware of an article—I think it was an article—I don’t remember when that took place, whenever the article was published. And then I understand there was legal opinions on the other side were requested by I believe the Chairman, and I know that those were published— Senator FEINGOLD. You do not recall when this matter first came up? I would think it would be something you would remember, when somebody suggested you should have recused yourself. Judge ROBERTS. I don’t remember the date of the— Senator FEINGOLD. How about the approximate time? Judge ROBERTS. I think it was sometime in July or— Senator FEINGOLD. Mr. Chairman, so the record would be complete, I would like to submit the article from Slate Magazine by Professors Gillers, Luban and Lubet and a letter sent to you responding to Professor Rotunda’s criticism of their position, and I also want to submit an article by these three law professors that was published in the Los Angeles Times on this topic. I do not want to take any more time on this, but I think these— Chairman SPECTER. Without objection that will be made a part of the record. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think these professors very convincingly answer Professor Rotunda’s views and point out that his analysis of the case law is not particularly persuasive. And I would urge any of my colleagues who really want to understand the issue with Judge Roberts’s participation in the case, rather than just dismissing it because it is inconvenient, that they take a look at it and actually see what the issues were here. But I do appreciate your answer to those questions. I will only be able to get to some of my questions on the next subject, and hopefully in the next round can continue. But, Judge Roberts, as Senator Leahy mentioned earlier, when you came before the Committee a couple of years ago, we discussed the fact that more than 100 people on death row have been exonerated and released, and, in fact, I believe the number is now 121 people who we know were sentenced to die for crimes they did not commit. I want to follow up on work that Senators Durbin and Leahy have done in discussing with you the Herrera case. I do differ with your characterization of the case. The Solicitor General brief that you signed presented the issue as whether the Constitution ‘‘requires that a prisoner have the right to seek judicial review of a claim of newly discovered evidence.’’ That is, the question was not how strong the evidence of innocence must be, as you seemed to be suggesting earlier, but whether the Constitution requires that there be some avenue for presenting evidence of innocence in Federal court. Your brief argued that it does not. Now, that brief also, as you know, contained a footnote that I am going to ask you to comment on. It said, ‘‘There is no reason to fear

that there is a significant risk that an innocent person will be executed under procedures that the States have in place. . . . The direct review and collateral procedures that the Federal Government and the States have in place are more than ample to separate the guilty from the innocent.’’ Yesterday you talked about the possible effect of DNA evidence on the legal framework in this type of case.
In light of the many cases of innocent people ending up on death row that have come to light in the past decade, and aside from what was the ultimate issue at stake in that case, do you still agree with your statement from the Government’s Herrera brief?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that was the administration position at the time. It was one that the Supreme Court agreed with; 6–3 I think was the ruling. I know Justice O’Connor was in the majority.
The issue—and, again, there was obviously argument a the time about what the issue really was in Herrera. And I thought it was quite inaccurate to view it as a case involving the question of whether actual innocence could be presented, because there was— it was a claim of newly discovered evidence, and it was a claim that somebody who had just died was actually the murderer. At the end of exhaustive appeals through the State system, exhaustive collateral review through the State system, exhaustive collateral review through the Federal system, is there an obligation to decide at that point that a new claim that somebody else committed the crime—
Senator FEINGOLD. I am running out of time, and I just wonder if you still stand by the statement, if you can just say yes or no.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that was the administration position. Senator FEINGOLD. All right. Well, let me cut to the quick. I would like to know whether you think there is a risk that innocent people may be sentenced to death in today’s criminal justice system. And I must say, Judge, Supreme Court Justices do have the power of life and death in these matters. Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I think there is always a risk in any enterprise that is a human enterprise like the legal system. Obviously, the objective of the provision of the rights to a criminal defendant and trial, the provision of collateral review at the State level, the provision of collateral review at the Federal level, the availability of, as you suggested, clemency—all of that is designed to ensure that the risk is as low as possible. There are issues that are going to be presented about the availability of DNA evidence which may or may not help reduce the risk even further. There is always a risk. And, obviously, when you’re dealing with something like capital punishment, the risk is something that has to be taken extremely seriously at every stage of the process. As we talked about more than 2 years ago at the prior hearing, I think the most effective way of minimizing that risk is to ensure that people facing that sanction have the best counsel available at every stage. As you know from looking at this problem, the issue that comes up are questions that weren’t raised that should have been raised if the person had a more capable lawyer, avenues that weren’t pursued that should have been pursued if that lawyer had the resources.

tion is going to be most effectively addressed, ensuring the availability of competent counsel at every stage of the proceeding.
Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator Feingold. Senator Graham? Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, your intellectual stamina impresses me because— you can’t see this on television—it must be 150 degrees in here. [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. And I just don’t know how you are doing it, but I am tremendously impressed. Mr. Chairman, I would like permission to introduce into the record some law professor’s opinion that being interviewed for the Supreme Court vacancy when Judge Roberts was interviewed did not require him to recuse himself, and I will do that at— Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Senator GRAHAM. But let’s think about that in kind of political terms, and I know that is not really your job. If we took this to its logical conclusion, say I was President—and I don’t think that is going to happen, so you don’t need to be overly worried about it. But you could pick someone to be Chief Justice from the people sitting on the Court; is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator GRAHAM. So if you had a judge you did not particularly like, the best thing you could do is go talk to him about the job and they could not decide anything. Would that be the logical conclusion of this? Judge ROBERTS. I think that would be the logical conclusion of some— Senator GRAHAM. Well, I will remember that if I am President. On the record now, I don’t think I should have the right to do that. That is part of the process. Some big themes here. Were you proud to work for Ronald Reagan? Judge ROBERTS. Very much, Senator, yes. Senator GRAHAM. During your time of working with Ronald Reagan, were you ever asked to take a legal position that you thought was unethical or not solid? Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, I was not. Senator GRAHAM. We talked about the Voting Rights Act. The proportionality test in the Reagan administration’s view was changing the Voting Rights Act to create its own harm. Is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. The concern that the Attorney General had, and the President, was that changing section 2 to the so-called effects test would cause courts to adopt a proportionality requirement, that if elected representatives were not elected in proportion to the racial composition in a particular jurisdiction, that there would be a violation shown that would have to be redressed. Senator GRAHAM. Do you think it would be fair to try to suggest that because you supported that position that you are somehow racially insensitive?

Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, and I would resist the suggestion that I am racially insensitive. I know why the phrase ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law’’ is carved in marble above the Supreme Court entrance. It is because of the fundamental commitment of the rule of law to ensure equal justice for all people without regard to race or ethnic background or gender. The courts are a place where people need to be able to go to secure a determination of their rights under the law in a totally unbiased way. That’s a commitment all judges make when they take a judicial oath.
Senator GRAHAM. Knowing this will not end this line of inquiry, but at least trying to put my stamp on what I think we have found from this long discussion, basically the Supreme Court decided in section 2 that the intent test was constitutionally sound. Is that correct?
Judge ROBERTS. That was its determination in Mobile v. Bolden. Senator GRAHAM. And Senator Kennedy disagreed because he wanted a different test. And I respect him. He is one of the great— first, he is not part of the Reagan Revolution. I think we all can agree with that, so I don’t expect him to buy into it. But I respect him greatly for his passion about his causes. He took it upon himself to try to change a Supreme Court ruling, to go away from the intent test to the effects test. And he was able to reach a political compromise with the administration. And I just want that to be part of the record. To say that Ronald Reagan or Judge Roberts by embracing a concept approved by the Court equates to that administration or this person being insensitive to people of color in this country I think is very unfair and off base. You said something yesterday that was very compelling to me. I asked you could you express or articulate what you thought might be one of the big threats to the rule of law. And I believe you said, ‘‘Judges overstepping their boundaries, getting into the land of making the law, putting their social stamp on a cause rather than interpreting the law because that could over time in the eyes of the public, undermine the confidence in the court.’’ Is that a correct summary? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator. Senator GRAHAM. Well, we have before us today, Judge Roberts, a legal opinion, just issued, hot off the presses, that says the Establishment Clause of the Constitution apparently is violated if an American expresses—recites the Pledge of Allegiance. You will be on the Court, I hope, and you will use your best judgment of how to reconcile the Ninth Circuit opinion. And I am not asking you to tell us how you might rule. I am making a personal observation that this is an example, in my opinion, of where judges do not protect us from having the Government impose religion upon us but declare war on all things religious. And that is my personal view and opinion. That is why most Americans sometimes are dumbfounded about what is going on in the name of religion. No American wants the Government to tell them how to worship, where to worship, or if to worship. But when we exercise our right to worship, it bothers me greatly that judges who are unelected confuse the concept between establishment and free exercise. And I will move on. I think it is one of the cases that is undermining the confidence in the judiciary, and I am glad you are sensitive to that.

The war on terror. In my past legal life, I have spent most of my legal career associated with the military, and I am proud to be a military lawyer. I am the only reservist in the Senate. I sat as an Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals judge. I handled the easy cases because I don’t have a whole lot of time and I help when I can. But I understand, I think, very well what it means to abide by the judicial canons of ethics, not to tip your hand, not to compromise yourself to get promoted or to get put on the court, promoted in the military or to get put on the court, trying to please your boss, trying to please a Senator. And my respect for you has gone up because you are unwilling to compromise your ethics, and I hope the Senate will understand that in the past other people were not required to do so.
Are you familiar with the Geneva Convention? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator. Senator GRAHAM. Do you believe that the Geneva Convention as a body of law, that it has been good for America to be part of that Convention? Judge ROBERTS. I do, yes. Senator GRAHAM. Why? Judge ROBERTS. Well, my understanding in general is it’s an effort to bring civilized standards to conduct of war, a generally uncivilized enterprise throughout history; an effort to bring some protection and regularity to prisoners of war in particular. And I think that’s a very important international effort. Senator GRAHAM. As Senator Kyl said, this will be the only time we will actually get to talk, and I do not want to compromise your role as a judge, but I do want you to help me express some concepts here that America needs to be more understanding of. And I want to work with my Democratic friends to see if we can find some way to deal with this. We are dealing with an enemy that is not covered by the Geneva Convention. Al Qaeda, by their very structure and nature, are not signatories to the Geneva Convention and are not covered under its dictates. An enemy combatant—are you familiar with that term in the law? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator, I am. Senator GRAHAM. What would an enemy combatant be under American jurisprudence? Who would they be? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I really have to— Senator GRAHAM. Fair enough, fair enough. Judge ROBERTS. Those cases are both pending, the ones that I have decided are pending before the Supreme Court, and those issues are likely to come before it. Senator GRAHAM. Fair enough. The Geneva Convention does not cover al Qaeda but our President has said that anyone in our charge, terrorist or not, will be treated humanely. I applaud the President because in fighting the war on terror, we need not become our enemy. Our strength as a Nation is believing in the rule of law, even for the worst of those that we may encounter. I admire Mr. Adams for representing the Redcoats. I cannot imagine how tough that must have been. But his willingness to take on the unpopular cause in the name of the rule of law has made us stronger.

When the President said that we will treat everyone humanely, even the worst of the worst, I think he has brought out the best in who we are. But we are in a war, Judge Roberts, where the Geneva Convention does not apply, and we have before the courts a line of cases dealing with the dilemma this country faces. When you capture an enemy combatant, non-citizen foreign terrorist, there are three things I think we must do: we must aggressively interrogate them without changing who we are; we must have the ability to keep them off the battlefield for a long period of time to protect our Nation; and we must have a system to hold them accountable for some of the most horrible crimes imaginable.
Justice Jackson was one of your favorite Justices; is that correct? Judge ROBERTS. I think that’s a fair description, yes. Senator GRAHAM. He has indicated in the Youngstown Steel case that the Presidency or the executive branch is at its strongest when it has concurrence with the legislative branch. Is that a fair summary of what he said? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, he divided up the area basically into three parts, and considering the executive’s authority, and said when it has the support of Congress, it’s at its greatest. And obviously when it’s in opposition to Congress, it’s at its lowest ebb, as he put it. And he described a middle area in which it was sometimes difficult to tell whether Congress was supporting the action or not. Senator GRAHAM. This is me speaking, not you. Congress is AWOL, ladies and gentlemen, in the war on terror when it comes to detention, interrogation, and prosecution of enemy non-citizen combatants. Justice Scalia has written eloquently that Congress has the power to get involved in these issues, and Congress is solid. What is the case—is it the Razul case where the Supreme Court in a 5–4 decision has given habeas corpus rights to non-citizen foreign terrorists? Judge ROBERTS. I think that’s correct, Senator, yes. Senator GRAHAM. That is an amazing departure from what we have been as a Nation for 200 years. I have been to Guantanamo Bay twice. The people running the prison tell me that 185 of the detainees have lawyers in Federal court. Justice Scalia says we have set up a situation where 94 different jurisdictions can hear habeas cases involving non-citizen foreign terrorists. The people running the jail say this process is undermining our ability to get good information. A habeas corpus petition hearing, would it allow a defense attorney to call a military commander in to answer for how this person was captured? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t know, Senator, and I hesitate to opine on that without knowing. Senator GRAHAM. Well, the truth is that we have set up a situation where our military leaders and our military commanders and soldiers in the field can be called from all over the world, all over the country, to answer for why such person is detained. We had a conversation in our office—in my office. You said something to the effect, as Justice Scalia said in his dissenting opinion, that this would be an area where the courts would welcome some congressional involvement. And right now we have the executive branch carrying the load totally by themselves. We have got sev-

eral cases before the Court dealing with detention policy, interrogation policy, and prosecution policy.
Do you believe that this is an area, if the Congress acted, as Justice Jackson said, that it would strengthen the hand of the Executive in the legal situation?
Judge ROBERTS. My observation during our meeting, Senator, was not an expression of legal determination, and it doesn’t necessarily mean a view that Congress’s action or involvement would be determinative or would even be within the scope of legal authority, depending on what the issue and the arguments were.
I do know that when you are in the middle area where it’s difficult to determine whether Congress is supporting the President’s action or is opposed to the President’s action, that the Court often has to try to read the tea leaves of related legislation. If you look at the Dames and Moore decision coming out of the Iranian hostage crisis, what the Court did in that case, applying the middle tier, was look at a vast array of legislation. And it was a very difficult enterprise to try to figure out what Congress’s view was. My point was simply that if we’d know what Congress’s view was, it might make it easier to apply it in a particular case, and you wouldn’t have to go through that process of trying to determine what position Congress was in, if that turned out to be pertinent under the particular legal challenge.
Senator GRAHAM. Thank you. Justice Scalia said in a very direct way, the courts are ill-equipped to deal with these issues. In the Youngstown Steel case, Justice Jackson says, ‘‘When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at the maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. A seizure executed by the President pursuant to an Act of Congress would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would rest heavily upon any who may attack.’’
Do you agree with that? Judge ROBERTS. That was read from the Jackson—I do. I agree with the basic proposition that the President’s authority is at its greatest when he has the support of Congress. Senator GRAHAM. To my colleagues, I think it is imperative for this body to get involved in the war on terror when it comes to detaining, interrogating, and prosecuting enemy combatants who are not citizens. It is important that all three branches of Government, in my opinion, feel comfortable with the policies of this Nation, that we will be stronger if the judicial branch, the legislative branch, and the executive branch are working together to come up with policies that will allow for aggressive interrogation, appropriate detention, and serious prosecution in a way that is within the values of our Nation. So that is why I will be introducing legislation on all those topics, and I will not ask you any further what you may or may not do about the legislation if it ever gets to the floor of the Senate and passed. The Kelo case. Of all the things that have been decided—and I haven’t been to my office since the recent case about the Pledge, so it may have trumped it—I have gotten more phone calls about the Kelo than anything the Supreme Court has done lately. And for

371
those who may be tuning in, the Kelo basically said that the Government can take your property, give it to someone else, another private person, because it could be used at a higher and best use and it might generate more taxes.
I am not going to ask you to tell me how you will decide the Kelo, but I just want you to know—as Senator Kyl indicated, this is the only time you can hear from us—that my phone is ringing off the hook and that every legislature that I know of is going into session as quickly as they can to correct that. So I want to leave with you—and when you meet your new colleagues, please let them know that some of the things they do, that we watch, and that the courts are able to do their job because the public defers to the Court and respects the Court. But there is a limit.
The Office of Chief Justice of the United States is different, as you are the first among equals. What do you believe as Chief Justice you can bring to the table that you could not as just a normal member of the Court?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, if I am confirmed, I think one of the things that the Chief Justice should have as a top priority is to try to bring about a greater degree of coherence and consensus in the opinions of the Court. I know that has been—it was a priority of the last Chief Justice. I actually believe that is something that should be a matter of concern for all of the Justices. But as the Chief, with responsibility for assigning opinions, I think he has greater scope for authority to exercise in that area, and perhaps over time can develop greater persuasive authority to make the point. Again, coming from the Chief, it may be a point that other Justices would receive—be more receptive to than they might coming from one of their colleagues, that we are not benefited by having six different opinions in a case, that we do need to take a step and think whether or not we really do feel strongly about a point on which a Justice is writing a separate concurrence which only he or she is joining, or whether the majority opinion could be revised in a way that wouldn’t affect anyone’s commitment to the judicial oath to decide the cases as they see fit, but would allow more Justices to join the majority so the Court speaks as a Court. That is something that the priority should be, to speak as a Court.
Senator GRAHAM. So your goal as Chief Justice is, where you can and as often as you can, to find consensus and unite the Court. Is that true?
Judge ROBERTS. I think the Court should be as united behind an opinion of the Court as it possibly can. Now, obviously, in many cases it is not going to be possible.
Senator GRAHAM. I applaud you because we are a divided Nation, and the more united we can become at any level of Government, the stronger we will be. So I applaud you for that attitude.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Graham. Senator Schumer? Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Judge Roberts, it is nice to talk to you so early in the day. Yesterday you stated that you ‘‘agree with the Griswold Court’s conclusion that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that.’’ And you noted that the Court’s later decisions have

372
based the constitutional right to privacy on the liberty component of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment.
Now, Justice Thomas at his confirmation hearing answered in a way very similar to the way you did. During his confirmation hearing, here is what he said: ‘‘I believe the approach that Justice Harlan took in . . . Griswold in determining the—or assessing the right to privacy was an appropriate way to go.’’
Now, we all know that Justice Harlan’s approach located the right to privacy in the liberty interest of the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. And Justice Thomas also said at his confirmation hearings, along the same lines, that he agreed with the Court decision in Eisenstadt v. Baird where the Court held that single people have the same right to privacy as married people on the issue of procreation.
However, since he has been confirmed onto the Court, Justice Thomas has not applied the right to privacy to key protections. For instance, in Lawrence in 2003, he declared that there is no general right to privacy in the Constitution.
Now, yesterday you said that, ‘‘Liberty is not limited to freedom from physical restraint. It does cover areas,’’ as you said, ‘‘such as privacy. It’s not only protected in procedural terms, but protected substantively as well.’’ You said that you agreed that, ‘‘There is a right to privacy to be found in the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment.’’ So that seems directly to contradict Justice Thomas’s view once he got on the Court, as I outlined, in Lawrence.
I assume that you disagree with Justice Thomas’s view that there is no general right to privacy, as he stated in Lawrence.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think that question depends obviously on the modifier and what you mean by ‘‘general.’’ I noted in going over the nomination hearings of Justice Breyer, he also said that the privacy interest is within the—is protected as part of the liberty— protected by the Due Process Clause. I think that is the general approach. Now the—
Senator SCHUMER. Let’s talk about Justice Thomas. He said there is no general right of privacy. You seemed to say yesterday— you didn’t seem to say. You said that there was a right to privacy. Let’s forget that Justice Thomas said it. You would disagree that there is no general right to privacy in the Constitution.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I wouldn’t use the phrase ‘‘general’’ because I don’t know what that means. I don’t know if by saying ‘‘general’’ they are trying to describe the particular scope to the right to privacy or not. I think there is a right to privacy protected as part of the liberty guarantee in the Due Process Clause.
Senator SCHUMER. A substantive right to privacy. Judge ROBERTS. Protected substantively, yes. Senator SCHUMER. Is it your reading of Justice Thomas’s case in Lawrence that he does not believe in that? Judge ROBERTS. No. I think his statement obviously focuses on general, and his conclusion in that case was that the right to privacy protected under the Due Process Clause that you noted he acknowledged at his hearings did not extend to include the activity at issue in Lawrence. Senator SCHUMER. Well, this is obviously very important because Justice Thomas seemed to be more full in his view of privacy at his

confirmation hearing than later when he was on the Court, at least if you read his decisions. And you are not willing to say that your view is different than the view Justice Thomas stated in Lawrence.
Judge ROBERTS. I’m not willing to state a particular view on the Lawrence decision, and that’s consistent with the approach that I’ve taken.
Senator SCHUMER. Let me ask you a broader question. Do you disagree with Justice Thomas’s interpretation of the right to privacy in any decided case?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I’m not going to comment on whether I think particular cases were correctly decided or not in areas—
Senator SCHUMER. I didn’t ask that. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t know which cases you’re talking about. Senator SCHUMER. Any. Any one you want. Judge ROBERTS. Well, that would be commenting on whether that decision was correctly decided or not. If I’m agreeing or disagreeing with one of the Justices’ views in that case, that would be commenting on whether that view was correct or not. If it was in a dissent, it would be disagreeing; if it was in the majority, it would be agreeing. And because those are in areas that could come before the Court, like every other nominee to come before this Committee who is on the Court today, I think it’s inappropriate to comment on the correctness or incorrectness of those decisions in areas that could come before the Court. Senator SCHUMER. So you are not—you do not have to answer this. It is obvious you will not state where you disagree with Justice Thomas, and it could well be that what he said at his hearing and you said at your hearing might lead to—might lead you to rule in the same way on privacy? Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, my view on privacy is as I’ve expressed, that there is a right to privacy, protected as part of the liberty under the Due Process Clause. Senator SCHUMER. Would you say there is a general right to privacy? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t know what ‘‘general’’ means. Senator SCHUMER. Substantive right to privacy. Judge ROBERTS. Well, substantive, yes, I have said that, that the protection extends to substantive protection. But when you say general, I don’t know what that means. I don’t know if that means— Senator SCHUMER. Didn’t Justice—excuse me. Didn’t Justice Thomas disagree with the substantive right to privacy in Lawrence? Judge ROBERTS. His conclusion was that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause did not extend to that right, yes. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. So it would seem to me you disagree with him. I think you just said it without saying it. Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, you’re asking me whether the right to privacy protected under the Liberty Clause extends to a particular right, the right at issue in Lawrence. Senator SCHUMER. I think what I am asking you, is there a substantive right to privacy? I didn’t apply it to a particular case.

Judge ROBERTS. I have said there is a substantive right to privacy.
Senator SCHUMER. And in Lawrence, Justice Thomas seemed to say there is no substantive right to privacy.
Judge ROBERTS. No. As I understand it—and, again, his testimony as a nominee was that there was. What he said is—the quote you read in Lawrence said there’s no general right to privacy. Now, I don’t know—
Senator SCHUMER. But his holding was that there was no substantive right to privacy under the Liberty Clause, wasn’t it? Wasn’t that the whole thrust of his argument?
Judge ROBERTS. No, I think, Senator, that his conclusion in Lawrence was that whatever right there was, it did not extend to the activity that was at issue in Lawrence.
Senator SCHUMER. The bottom line is you are unwilling to differentiate yourself from Justice Thomas’s view in Lawrence.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s consistent with the approach I’ve taken, that I don’t think it’s appropriate to protect—as necessary to protect the independence and integrity of the Court to comment on whether that decision was correctly decided or not. And that is consistent with the approach that every member of the Court has taken—
Senator SCHUMER. I just didn’t ask you that. I asked you if you would—I asked you if you disagreed with his particular holding, and—but let me ask you a few other questions here, because I think you are cutting back a little on what you said yesterday, at least if you look at the whole picture here and your unwillingness to disagree with Justice Thomas.
But let me ask you this about judges in general. You sit on a court, correct?
[Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. Okay. And sometimes you dissent. [Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. And that’s routine, not just for your but for every judge. Judge ROBERTS. It’s rare on our court, I’m happy to— Senator SCHUMER. Yes, it is. It is. That is true. I have noticed that. But it happens in courts all the time. [Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. Okay. And in doing so, the dissenting judge is criticizing the majority opinion, right? [Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. Disagreeing with it? [Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. And I take it this happens on the Supreme Court quite often. [Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. And, in fact, there aren’t that many unanimous Supreme Court cases on major cases these days. Judge ROBERTS. Well, actually, at one point the statistics always showed that more cases were unanimous than anything else. Senator SCHUMER. But there are a lot of dissenting judgments. Judge ROBERTS. There are a lot.

Senator SCHUMER. And every Justice on the Supreme Court has dissented in many cases.
[Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. Meaning they disagreed with the opinion of the Court, right? [Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. And nothing is wrong with that. There is nothing improper, nothing unethical. [Judge Roberts nods head.] Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Let’s go to commentators. Non-judges are free to criticize and disagree with Supreme Court cases, correct? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. In speeches, law review articles. This is a healthy process, wouldn’t you say? Judge ROBERTS. I agree with that, yes. Senator SCHUMER. And you did this occasionally when you were in private practice? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Nothing unseemly about that. Judge ROBERTS. No. Senator SCHUMER. Okay. And how about lawyers representing clients? Lawyers representing clients criticize cases in legal briefs all the time. That is what they do for a living. Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. And that is part of being a good lawyer. And you have signed your name to briefs explicitly criticizing and disagreeing with Supreme Court decisions. Judge ROBERTS. On occasion, yes. Senator SCHUMER. In Rust v. Sullivan, for example, your brief said that, ‘‘Roe was wrongly decided and should be overturned.’’ Right? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. Okay. But in this hearing room, you don’t want to criticize or disagree with any decided cases. That seems strange to me. It seems strange, I think, to the American people, that you can’t talk about decided cases, past cases, not future cases, when you have been nominated to the most important job in the Federal judiciary. You could do it when you worked in the White House. You could do it when you worked in the Justice Department. You could do it when you worked in private practice. You could do it when you gave speeches and lectures. As a sitting judge, you have done it until very recently. You could probably do it before you just walked into this hearing room. And if you are confirmed, you may be doing it for 30 years on the Supreme Court. But the only place and time that you cannot criticize any cases of the Supreme Court is in this hearing room when it is more important than at any other time that the American people and we, the Senators, understand your views. Why this room should be some kind of cone of silence is beyond me. The door outside this room does not say, ‘‘Check your views at the door.’’ So your failure to answer questions is confounding me. You have done it in instance after instance after instance after instance. What is the difference between giving your views here in

this hearing room and what judges do every day, what professors do every day, what lawyers do every day? In each case, they have to state their opinion. They have to do it as part of their job, if you will, writing a brief, rendering an opinion, writing an article. In each case they are stating their views, which might bias them. You have done it.
Yet only here you cannot state your views. If the argument—and by the way, there is a very good countervailing reason that you should state your views, because, as the Founding Fathers so constructed, this is the one time you go before an elected body before a lifetime appointment. And it seems to me this is something of an argument of convenience. Senator Specter said it well. He said you will answer as many questions as you have to to get confirmed. That may be the actual fact, but it is not the right thing to do, in my judgment.
And so please tell us why is the bias, why is the fact that you have already stated an opinion any different when you sit in this room, in terms of jeopardizing your future as a judge, than it is when you are doing all these other things that you have done? And let me just remind you—I am going to give you a chance to answer this, but I think it is bothering a lot of people in this room and out of this room. Justice Ginsburg, people who have sat in your very chair, just about every single Justice, with one or two exceptions, has given their opinions of existing cases.
Justice Ginsburg said on Roe v. Wade, ‘‘My view is that if Roe had been less sweeping, people would have accepted it more readily.’’ Do you think she was unable to keep an open mind in cases implicating Roe? Do you? Do you think she was unable to keep an open mind? Just answer me about her, not about what you think—
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I’ll explain why she expressed her views on that particular issue. It was an explanation that she gave at the time, that she had written extensively on that subject and she thought that her writings were fair game for discussion. She took a different view—
Senator SCHUMER. But she—excuse me, I just—because I want to—She would be expressing an opinion which might yield bias whether she wrote before or not. She did it over and over again. She praised Learned Hand’s First Amendment decision in Masses Publishing. I don’t think she was unable to keep her mind open on courts in that line. As Joe Biden said, in Moore v. East Cleveland, she candidly—and I don’t think she had writings on that one. She expressed that the opinion has difficulties. And other Justices have done it. Justice Bryer talked about the topic at issue later in U.S. v. Booker, Justice Powell about Miranda, Justice Souter about Miranda. It didn’t bias him in the Dickerson case. Not all of these people had previously written.
You can make a distinction to every single example I give. You can say, well, she wrote on that one. But when you add it all up, you are being less forthcoming. I know you are doing what you feel is right, but you are being less forthcoming with this Committee than just about any other person who has come before us. You are so bright and you know so much, but there is another aspect to this, which is letting us know what you think. And you have set up your own little construct. It is not really the Ginsburg precedent

or it isn’t Canon 5, which you cited repeatedly at your court of appeals hearing.
And so let me ask you this one question and then you can answer it in general. Has there been any judge that you are aware of who has had to recuse himself or herself because of what they said at a confirmation hearing? Can you name for me a judge who you think was biased or not able to render justice because they gave their opinion at a confirmation hearing, sitting at this table as you do?
Judge ROBERTS. I think, because the Justices have followed the approach that I am following, and as I said, I’ve gone back and read every one of the transcripts for the Justices, they have avoided commenting on whether they think decisions were correctly decided or not. If you look at what Justice Ginsburg said when she was asked whether she thought the Mayer and Harris cases were correctly decided, you will see she said, I’m not going to comment on that. She said, I know what the precedents are, I have no agenda to overrule them, and that’s all I’m going to say.
Senator SCHUMER. She commented on many other cases, as you went through with Senator Biden yesterday and as we have gone through a little bit here. She commented on many different cases, didn’t she?
Judge ROBERTS. My understanding— Senator SCHUMER. There were reasons, but she did comment on other cases, didn’t she? Judge ROBERTS. My understanding of the cases she felt it appropriate to comment on, as I’ve said, were the ones where she had already written on it. And she said, I think my writings are appropriate. Senator SCHUMER. There are no cases she commented on where she hadn’t written? Judge ROBERTS. I thought she adhered to her view. Her view was no hints, no forecasts, no previews. That’s exactly what she said. That’s an exact quote from her hearing transcript. Senator SCHUMER. I have to say, sir, I disagree with you. I have looked at her testimony. She didn’t comment on some cases and commented on others. If you look at how many she commented on and how many she didn’t, it is a far different balance than you, who have commented on Marbury, Brown, Griswold, and not much else. And each time, even when we talked yesterday about Wickard v. Filburn—and it is a 1942 case, it is at the root of a large, it is a trunk of a large tree of constitutional law—you were unwilling to comment. And of course you say it might come before the Court. But that is a prediction. Some may, some may not. Maybe a Brown case would come before the Court. Maybe a Griswold case would come before the Court. And if you had wanted to, you could have easily said those may come before the Court and not answer those. It is sort of your own little way of doing it. I just have one more question here. The President, as I said— and this motivates some of us—he said he wants to nominate judges in the mold of Thomas and Scalia. I want to ask you, are you in the mold of Thomas and Scalia? The President said he wanted to nominate people that way.

Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I’ll give the same answer I gave yesterday to Senator Graham when he asked if I would be in the mold of the Chief Justice. And the answer is I will be my own man on the Supreme Court. Period.
Senator SCHUMER. I appreciate that. Do you think they are activist judges? Judge ROBERTS. I’m not going to criticize them with respect to any general description of that sort. I’m sure there are cases where I would agree with them, there are cases where I would disagree with them, as with all of the Justices. Senator SCHUMER. Right. Okay. Now—by the way, I will note, I don’t think I have time here, but you did criticize in a memo back when you were working in Attorney General Fred Fielding’s office, Brennan and Marshall as activist judges. Now, I don’t think that was the official position of the Reagan administration, so it seemed to be your opinion. Can you tell me in 30 seconds, so I can just ask one more question, how is it different not to want to characterize Justices Thomas and Scalia but it was okay to characterize Justices Marshall and Brennan as activist? Judge ROBERTS. Well, that was a—it was a reflection of the views of the Attorney General at the time, and that was part of the administration’s position. Senator SCHUMER. But was it official Reagan policy? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t think it was official policy. It was an expression that the Attorney General had made on various occasions. Senator SCHUMER. Let me just say, sir, in all due respect—and I respect your intelligence and your career and your family—this process is getting a little more absurd every time—the further we move. You agree we should be finding out your philosophy and method of legal reasoning, modesty, stability, but when we try to find out what modesty and stability mean, what your philosophy means, we don’t get any answers. It is as if I asked you what kind of movies you like. Tell me two or three good movies. And you say, I like movies with good acting. I like movies with good directing. I like movies with good cinematography. And I ask you, no, give me an example of a good movie. You don’t name one. I say give me an example of a bad movie. You won’t name one. Then I ask you if you like ‘‘Casablanca,’’ and you respond by saying, Lots of people like ‘‘Casablanca.’’ [Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. You tell me it is widely settled that ‘‘Casablanca’’ is one of the great movies. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Schumer, now that your time is over, are you asking him a question? Senator SCHUMER. Yes. I am saying, sir, I am making a plea here. I hope we are going to continue this for a while, that within the confines of what you think is appropriate and proper, you try to be a little more forthcoming with us in terms of trying to figure out what kind of Justice you will become. Chairman SPECTER. We will now take a 15-minute break and reconvene at 4:25. Judge ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, could I address some of the—

Chairman SPECTER. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I didn’t hear any question, Judge Roberts, but you—
Judge ROBERTS. Well, there were several along the way. I will be very succinct.
Chairman SPECTER. You are privileged to comment. This is coming out of his next round, if there is one.
Judge ROBERTS. Oh, well, then. [Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. I guess there will be. Judge ROBERTS. First, ‘‘Dr. Zhivago’’ and ‘‘North by Northwest.’’ [Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. Now how about on the more important subject of what cases— Judge ROBERTS. On the more important subject, I— Chairman SPECTER. Let him finish his answer. You are out of time. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. The only— Senator SCHUMER. Not out of movies. Judge ROBERTS. The only point I would like to make, because you raised the question how is this different than Justices who dissent and criticize and how is this different than professors. And I think there are significant differences. The Justice who files a dissent is issuing an opinion based upon his participation in the judicial process. He confronted the case with an open mind, he heard the arguments, he fully and fairly considered the briefs, he consulted with his colleagues, he went through the process of issuing an opinion. And in my experience, every one of those stages can cause you to change your view. The view you ask, then, of me, well, what do you think, is it correct or not, or how would you come out, that’s not a result of that process. And that is why I shouldn’t respond to those types of questions. Now, the professor, how is that different? That professor is not sitting here as a nominee before the Committee. And the great danger of courts that I believe every one of the Justices has been vigilant to safeguard against is turning this into a bargaining process. It is not a process under which Senators get to say I want you to rule this way, this way, and this way. And if you tell me you’ll rule this way, this way, and this way, I’ll vote for you. That is not a bargaining process. Judges are not politicians. They cannot promise to do certain things in exchange for votes. And if you go back and look at the transcripts, Senator, I would just respectfully disagree. I think I have been more forthcoming than any of the other nominees. Other nominees have not been willing to tell you whether they thought Marbury v. Madison was correctly decided. They took a very strict approach. I have taken what I think is a more pragmatic approach and said if I don’t think that’s likely to come before the Court, I will comment on it. And, you know, again, perhaps that’s subject to criticism, because it is difficult to draw the line sometimes. But I wanted to be able to share as much as I can with the Committee in response to the concerns you and others have expressed, and so I have adopted that approach. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you.

Chairman SPECTER. 4:25. We are anxious to try to conclude your testimony, Judge Roberts, as early as we can. I know you will agree with that.
Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sorry—thank you for the accommodation.
[Recess 4:13 to 5:10 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We found out as soon as we had completed the recess that a vote had been called, and the Senators have been over voting, which accounts for the slight hiatus here, but we are now going to proceed. It is the turn of Senator Cornyn for a 20-minute round. Senator LEAHY. I am sure, Mr. Chairman, the Judge just missed us terribly, could not wait for us all to get back here. Judge ROBERTS. Glad we’re back. Chairman SPECTER. He may have missed us just under the theory that the sooner we start, the sooner we end. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. But that principle may not apply here. Stare decisis would suggest that it does not. Senator Cornyn. Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, my observation is that you have been completely bipartisan when it comes to refusing to answer questions either from this side of the aisle or that side of the aisle, that you feel would compromise your independence as a judge or violate your code of conduct as a judge. I have to tell you though that there are people who may be keeping score of how many questions you are answering propounded by this side and that side. And I guess one way to sort of run the score up would be to keep asking questions that you know you cannot answer, and thus to claim some grievance or advantage when it comes to making that comparison, but I hope we do not do that. I want to talk to you a little bit—well, first of all, before we go there, I know one of the questions involved the Code of Judicial Conduct and whether you were proscribed by that and the differences between what you have felt at liberty to testify to, and Justice Ginsburg did. But I notice that in the commentary to Canon 5, the Model Code of Judicial Conduct, the last sentence says, ‘‘This section applies to any statement made in the process of securing judicial office, such as statements to commissions charged with judicial selection and tenure, and legislative bodies confirming appointment.’’ Is that your recollection of the Code’s scope? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator. Senator CORNYN. I would ask unanimous consent that that be made a part of the record. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will not dwell on this any more about the numbers of questions asked, but I know we are now up to about 66 questions that you have responded to on the role of a judge and your judicial philos-

ophy, 48 on civil rights and discrimination, 44 on abortion and privacy.
Let me ask you this, if we keep asking the same question over and over and over again, but try to approach it from a slightly different way to get you to answer a question that you do not feel you can ethically answer, are you going to give us a different answer, or are you going to give us the same answer?
Judge ROBERTS. I hope my answer would be the same, Senator. Senator CORNYN. I am sure that is the case. We talked about the Code of Judicial Conduct and your ethical obligation. We have talked about the practical aspects of being a judge and the importance. And I guess this is not just practical. It is really a constitutional duty that judges have to maintain judicial independence, even from the legislative branch, by making commitments of performance in office as a condition to your confirmation. But I want to also ask you what I would call, I guess for lack of a better phrase, practical reasons why it is hard if not impossible, even if a judge wanted to, to be able to accurately predict how you might decide a particular matter. I was interested to hear Senator Biden earlier ask you about right-to-die issues, and you said, ‘‘I can’t answer the question in the abstract,’’ and he said, ‘‘That’s not abstract, that’s real.’’ And you said, ‘‘Well, Senator, as a legal matter it is abstract because the question would be in any particular case, is there a law that applies that governs that decision?’’ That prompted me to think of in addition to, as I think Senator DeWine asked you about, the case or controversy limitation in Article III of the Constitution, that limits the manner in which you might reach a particular issue, so it requires a case or controversy. He talked about standing and the importance of litigants actually having a stake in the outcome so they are willing to fight hard in the adversarial process. Could you explain, for example, why the adversarial process is so important? And it is important for judges to make sure that people have an actual stake in the outcome, rather than, let us say—well, I know Senator Brownback, Senator Coburn, all of us get letters from constituents that say, ‘‘What is your position on the Base Realignment and Closing Commission?’’ And why we just cannot write judges letters and ask what your opinion is just sort of for an advisory capacity. Judge ROBERTS. Well, that actually goes back very far in our history, as you know, to the early States when John Jay, I believe, as the first Chief Justice, was asked for his opinion on a matter, and he made the determination that it would be inappropriate to give that kind of advice. It was really one of the leading historical episodes that contributed to implementing the separation of powers. I think he appreciated that if he started just giving advice on legal questions that were of concern to the President, that he would be acting more like an Attorney General and it wouldn’t be separated from the Executive. And then he would be in a position of giving the President advice, while at the same time ruling on the legality of his conduct. I think the reason John Jay decided that was not appropriate for these new judges on the new Supreme Court to give advisory opinions is because he appreciated that they were in the

Judicial Department, as the Constitution put it, not in the Executive Department, or if the advice, request for advice had come from the Legislature. It’s an important part of the separation of powers that our courts don’t give advisory opinions.
Now, some State courts do have a different system of separation of powers, and in some State courts the Supreme Court will give an advisory opinion, but the Federal rule has always been that you have to have a constitutional case or controversy.
Senator CORNYN. Is that a constitutional limitation? Judge ROBERTS. It’s in Article III, yes. Senator CORNYN. I mean it is not something you can take or leave? Judge ROBERTS. No. The requirement of an actual case or controversy is derived from the Constitution. There are some aspects of standing doctrine that are, they say, prudential, in other words, that it’s up to the Court whether to apply them or not, but the core requirement, that the litigants have a stake in the issue, a case or controversy, is a constitutional requirement. Senator CORNYN. In getting back to Senator Biden’s question about right to die, and what you believe or what your position would be if that were to come before the Court. It just occurred to me you would have to determine whether there was in fact a case or controversy, whether there was actually a person that had standing, that is, with a concrete stake in the outcome that brought the lawsuit, so as to preserve that adversarial process. It would, I imagine, if you are sitting as an appellate judge, either in the circuit court or Supreme Court, you would want to look and see what the evidence is, and maybe, for example, whether it would make any difference in a right-to-die case whether someone had a living will or not, and what the evidence was in the court below before you could really sort of make a pronouncement from on high, that, yes, right to die trumps everything. Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s hard to know whether it trumps something until you know what the other something is, and that includes what the legislation might be. I’ve had many questions before this Committee about the importance of deferring to the legislature in areas in which Congress is given authority under the Constitution. Well, as a judge, before I would propound the idea of right, that it does not matter what the issue is on the other side, I would like to know if a legislature had addressed that issue. Now, sometimes, as you know, legislatures can exceed their constitutional bounds and there are rights under the Constitution that individuals have that trump efforts by the legislature to address those or infringe upon them, but you need to know what the issue is in terms of the conflict between an asserted right and an asserted power of the legislature. I do not think members of a legislative body would accept the principle that you would decide a case like that without even knowing what the legislature had enacted or what the issue was or why they had decided that this was an appropriate area of legislation. That is not deciding the controversy. It is just saying we need to have the issue narrowed in a way that courts are familiar with addressing.

383
Senator CORNYN. Well, then, of course, juries in many instances are the fact finder, and their determination is usually binding on not only the court below, but also appellate courts reviewing that, and I guess citizens would feel that they were engaged in a futile exercise of serving on juries and listening to evidence and trying to decide disputed facts if the judge on appeal was just going to say, you know, ‘‘Let us throw that out the window. We do not really care because this is a result we want to reach in a particular case.’’
Judge ROBERTS. Well, judges, when they sit down to decide a case, when the cases come into the chambers, judges don’t sit and decide, well, what do I think about issues under the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment or the Seventh Amendment. They want to know what the case is about, and that begins with knowing what the factual dispute is about and what the record is. Then they want to know what law applies in resolving that question. And they want to know what the arguments are. That’s why we have briefs on one side, then briefs on the other. And I’m sure you’ve had the same experience that I’ve had, which is that you find the opening brief can be very persuasive; then you move on to the second one, and you see it in an entirely different light. And maybe your view of the case will change again as you consult with your colleagues on the bench or as you hear the oral argument.
I know I spent a lot of time doing those briefs and arguments, and I certainly hope they had some impact on a case from time to time. And then when you sit down with the judges, all of these things, your view of the case is going to change in some way at every stage. And to say that it’s the same thing when you sit down and ask an abstract question as when you have been through the judicial process and reached a decision, including having to reduce it to writing, the requirement that judges write opinions is an important discipline on the decisional process, because—and those opinions are going to be submitted to the public, and everyone is going to be able to see your reasoning. And so it has to be coherent and reasonable and something that can stand the glare of publicity and the scrutiny of scholars and other judges.
That’s a very important discipline. It means—it’s quite a bit different than saying, well, what do you think about this and whatever opinion you might give.
Senator CORNYN. I am also, of course, intrigued by how poorly Senators, Presidents, and others who try to predict how a lifetenured judge or Justice on the Supreme Court is likely to look at issues next year, 10 years, 20 years down the road. And it just occurs to me that there is a long list of examples where life tenure and the lack of electoral or political accountability has caused judges to change the way they perhaps have looked at things over time, and I guess how badly Presidents have guessed sometimes about how a judge will decide cases in the future. And I think, you know, one of my favorites is Teddy Roosevelt and Oliver Wendell Holmes, when he said, ‘‘I could carve more backbone in a banana than demonstrated by this Justice.’’ He was pretty hot.
So, in addition to the ethical, the constitutional, the practical limitations, it just seems to me that we are engaged in a little bit of a futility here because when you are confirmed—and I expect that you will be confirmed—the designers of our Constitution ex-

pected and created a system where you would be immunized or at least insulated, I should say, from political or other pressures.
I know there were questions about—I want to move quickly to your participation in a lawsuit. Let me see. It was the Hamdi case?
Judge ROBERTS. Hamdan was the one that— Senator CORNYN. Hamdan. Judge ROBERTS. Hamdi was the one in the— Senator CORNYN. Supreme Court, right. Sometimes I confuse those. Judge ROBERTS. It is a common source of confusion. Senator CORNYN. And we have had a little back and forth. I think Senator Feingold asked about the ethics of your participation. Senator Graham I thought made a very good point in talking about if a President wanted to disqualify a judge in a case, well, just call the judge up and tell him, ‘‘You are being considered for a Federal appointment,’’ which certainly cannot be right. But do you know for a fact that Justice Breyer, when he was being considered about a possible nomination to the Supreme Court, sat and decided seven cases while sitting on the First Circuit Court of Appeals? Are you familiar with that statistic? Judge ROBERTS. No, I’m not, Senator. Senator CORNYN. Okay. Well, our research reveals that that is, in fact, what happened, and so if Justice Breyer could participate fully in the court’s decisionmaking process while being considered by President Clinton for appointment to, nomination to the Supreme Court, it strikes me that we should not have a different standard. And I am not asking you to comment on that because you said you are not familiar with Justice Breyer’s record. But if that is true—and I believe it is, that he sat on seven different cases involving the U.S. Government and the executive branch while he was being considered for the Supreme Court, we shouldn’t hold John Roberts to a different standard. And that is my view. We have about 5 minutes. Let me just ask you just as a practical matter, I worry when I see that the Supreme Court’s opinions are so fractured and divided as you alluded to, I believe, on the question of the Ten Commandments. The only one that agreed with both decisions that the Ten Commandments could be displayed in Texas but not in Kentucky was Justice Breyer. And there were ten opinions in those two cases, which led the former Chief Justice Rehnquist to quip, ‘‘Well, that’s more opinions than we have Justices.’’ Ten opinions for nine Justices in that case which decided the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments. Well, it strikes me that one of the goals of the Court ought to be—of any court ought to be to write decisions that can be read and understood by a person of reasonable intelligence and, frankly, Judge, I have to tell you that lawyers struggle, no doubt circuit court judges, trial court judges such as in the court you serve on now struggle to try to figure out just what in the world the law actually is. And it breeds additional litigation, a lot of money, a lot of time spent just litigating issues that the Court could, if it had the will, clearly decide. And in some ways, I think it leads some observers to wonder whether the Supreme Court is firmly grounded in the reality of how their decisions will actually be read and understood and imple-

mented, either by lower courts or by litigants who are trying to figure out what is the law, so how can I conform my behavior and how can I make plans in a way that I can rely upon is legal.
I would be interested in your observations. Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I hope we haven’t gotten to the point where the Supreme Court’s opinions are so abstruse that the educated lay person can’t pick them up and read them and understand them. You shouldn’t have to be a lawyer to understand what the Supreme Court opinions mean. One of the reasons I’ve given previously for admiring Justice Jackson is he was one of the best writers the Court has ever had, and I think you didn’t have to be a lawyer to pick up one of his opinions and understand exactly what his reasoning is and why he is saying that, and if he is citing and relying on precedents, he cites them and explains them. They are not written in jargon or legalese, but an educated person whose life, after all, is being affected by these decisions can pick them up and read them, and you don’t have to hire a lawyer to tell you what it means. I hope we haven’t gotten to a point where that is an unattainable ideal. Now, I’m not suggesting that I’ve always lived up to that, and I’d hate to have somebody go back and look at my opinions and critique them under that exacting standard. But I do think that’s something that it’s worth shooting for, at least in most cases, that opinions should be accessible to educated people without regard to whether they’re lawyers or not. Senator CORNYN. Well, I think your experience as both a lawyer practicing before the Supreme Court and advising clients, as well as being a circuit court judge and trying to apply those as an intermediate appellate court, will help you understand that and the importance of that. In the last few seconds we have here, you know, I was reflecting on the Ten Commandments cases, and I was thinking that, as crazy as it struck me that they would uphold it in Texas but strike it down in Kentucky, you know, I wondered—I am glad they did not take out their blue pencil and try to edit the Ten Commandments, because several of them—Thou shalt not murder; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not give false testimony against your neighbor—it is hard for me to see how those violate the Establishment Clause. But maybe that is another topic for another day. Thank you very much, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. Senator Leahy and I have been discussing the schedule. There had been a request for 30 additional minutes, all to be done tomorrow. A schedule has been structured which will conclude shortly before 8 o’clock this evening, and we will take a little time in the morning and then move ahead to the public witnesses. So that what we will be having is Senator Durbin will have his 20 minutes from 5:35 until 5:55. Senator Brownback will then have his 20 minutes and Senator Coburn will have his 20 minutes from time yielded back. And the Republicans met and decided we would not take a third round, in order to expedite the process. Tomorrow morning, Senator Kennedy is willing to negotiated 30 down to 20 if it is tomorrow morning, so he will be on at 9 o’clock.

Senator LEAHY. Is the 20th? Chairman SPECTER. It is a Tuesday. Senator LEAHY. My proposal, and I would commit to you on this, that—just so people watching can understand—the Judge knows this—that under our rules, when we have a markup in exec, when the nomination would come up, any Senator has the right, for any reason whatsoever or no reason, to put it over for one week, which, where this is now set for Tuesday, would put it over to the following Tuesday. My proposal, and the Chairman has been accommodating of what we have been trying to do, is that I would commit to him that we would move the exec to Thursday of next week, which would give everybody plenty of time to read all the transcripts and everything else. On Thursday we would waive—and I am sure nobody on your side is going to ask—to put it over by 1 day, so we will debate it, whatever appropriate time that is, on Thursday. We will vote on Thursday within the Committee. Then, of course, it is out of our hands. It is up to the leadership to schedule what time they want it on the floor. I understand they want to do it sometime— Chairman SPECTER. I think Senator Frist, the leader, will want to bring it to the floor on Monday, the 26th. But he will make the final judgment on that. And Senator Leahy and I have talked between ourselves, on the exec we are going to set the pattern for 10minute statements and ask that that pattern be followed. All Senators have rights as they choose. I personally am opposed to a third round. But in the face of requests by many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for a third round, and in light of its being a lifetime appoint for Chief Justice and all the other factors, I want to accommodate people as best I can. And I don’t want to run too far into tomorrow because I want to finish the public witnesses tomorrow. We may have to run very late, but it is easier to run later with the public witnesses because we have 31 and six panels and they will all be fresh. And Judge Roberts, whom I conferred with before discussing the matter with Senator Leahy, is a very, very good sport. The one question he answered positively and affirmatively was whether he could take it until 8 o’clock this evening, and he said he could. I don’t think it advisable to take him beyond that time. So we will spill over a little bit into tomorrow morning. Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, as I have noted, you have been fair in listening to us. We all think so, obviously. And I think Judge Roberts would be the first to say this. This is a very serious thing. We are talking about the Chief Justice of the United States. We should take time to do it right. I commend Mrs. Roberts, who has sat through this. And of course you, Judge, cannot see her, but the look of love and devotion from Mrs. Roberts, is probably what

is sustaining you through these long hours, and I commend her for doing it.
But I also want to applaud the Chairman. He has been fair. We have discussed—I said yesterday or the day before; they blur—that the Chairman and I, I think, have each other’s home numbers on speed dial, we have talked so much. He has fulfilled every one of his commitments. We have worked hard to fulfill ours. We all take this seriously. A number of people have announced how they are going to vote, and that is fine. Everybody has a right to do it. Every member of the Senate is going to think of this seriously and will vote as they are going to vote. I just want to make sure that when anybody votes that they know what they have.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I commend you again for running a very fair, very open, very honest hearing.
Senator SCHUMER. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Thank you for your cooperation, Senator Leahy. Just a moment and I will recognize you, Senator Schumer. I don’t want anybody to feel they have been short-changed by the spilling over a little. I feel my duty is to have this matter resolved by October 3rd. And I think, if confirmed, Judge Roberts can take the seat as Chief Justice on October 3rd. That is what I am looking toward. And to the extent possible, I want people on this Committee to feel good about what we are doing and have sufficient time. Senator Schumer? Senator SCHUMER. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to go over the schedule. So we will start the third round this evening of 15minute rounds and then continue tomorrow? Chairman SPECTER. That is correct, except for Senator Leahy was taking 10 and 10 as ranking, and Senator Kennedy is going to take 20, but all tomorrow morning, giving up 10 minutes for the morning. Senator FEINSTEIN. I get 15 tomorrow morning. Chairman SPECTER. You have 15 tomorrow morning and 15 this evening. Senator SCHUMER. Same here. Chairman SPECTER. And the same for Senator Schumer. Senator SCHUMER. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank you. I think you are being—I want to commend you and Senator Leahy. You are being fair and we are getting a full opportunity to ask questions. Chairman SPECTER. Do I understand you are waiving the fourth round, Senator Schumer? Senator LEAHY. As well as the fifth. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Durbin, you are recognized for 20 minutes. On to business, Judge Roberts. Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for your fairness. Judge Roberts, good to see you again, and Mrs. Roberts, friends and family. Yesterday and again today, you have continued to prove your legal talents. I remember law students with your talents when I was in law school. I had to get to know them in the first year be-

cause they were then off to the Law Review, and I was off to buy another Gilbert’s Outline. I didn’t see them again.
But today I have noticed that the questions have changed some. The questions have gone beyond your resume and beyond your legal skills. And I think it relates to the fact that so frequently, when asked, you have said, appropriately, that you will be driven and inspired by the rule of law, which is an appropriate term but a hard and cold term by itself. We know you have the great legal mind and have proven it here. But the questions that have been asked more and more today really want to know what is in your heart, and I think those are appropriate.
When you look down from the bench or read a trial transcript, do you just see plaintiffs and parties and precedents, or more? Do you see the people behind the precedents, the families behind the footnotes? I think that is what many of us are driving at with these questions.
You have lived a comfortable life. Court cases often involve people who have not. Many times, contests between the powerful and the powerless, as someone said in the opening statement, are contests where the powerless just have the rule of law and the Constitution on their side, praying for relief for their day in court.
Aside from a few pro bono cases, as important as they are—and I salute you for being involved in them—what would the powerless, the disenfranchised, minorities, and others see in your life experience that would lead them to believe that they would have a fighting chance in your Court?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I think there are many things that people could look to. You said I had a comfortable life. I think that’s a fair characterization. I had a middle-class upbringing in Indiana. As part of that, I worked in the steel mills outside of Gary during the summers, as soon as I was old enough to do that, and throughout my life have been exposed to and mixed with at school, learned and played with people of a wide variety of backgrounds. Comfortable, yes, but isolated, in no sense.
I was, I would say, a typical middle-class kid growing up in Indiana and had, I think, a great upbringing. I was privileged in the sense of having my parents and sisters contributing to my upbringing and education. And I think people looking at my life would see someone in that experience, and obviously with limitations. I wasn’t raised in other places in the country. I might have a different perspective if I were. I wasn’t raised in different circumstances and would have different experiences if I were. If you look at the Supreme Court, the people there come from widely different backgrounds and experiences, and I think that’s a healthy thing.
But as far as someone going into Court and looking to see why they would expect to get a fair hearing from me, I think—and I can answer this with respect to the court I am on now. It’s hard for me to imagine what their case is about that I haven’t been on their side at some point in my career. If it’s somebody who’s representing welfare recipients who have had their benefits cut off, I’ve done that. If it’s somebody who’s representing a criminal defendant who’s facing a long sentence in prison, I’ve done that. If it’s a prosecutor who’s doing his job to defend society’s interest against crimi-

nals, I have been on the side of the prosecution. If it’s somebody who’s representing environmental interests, environmentalists in the Supreme Court, I’ve done that. If it’s somebody who’s representing the plaintiffs in an antitrust case, I’ve been in that person’s shoes; I’ve done that. If it’s somebody representing a defendant in an antitrust case, I’ve done that as well.
It’s one of the, I think, great benefits of the opportunity I’ve had to practice law as I have, is that it has not been a specialized practice. I have not just represented one side or the other. I’ve represented all of those interests. And I think those people will know that have had their perspective. I’ve been on the other side of the podium with a case just like theirs, and that should, I hope—and I hope it does now—encourage them that I will be fair and that I will decide the case according to the law, but I will have seen it from their perspective.
Senator DURBIN. So let me follow through on that because I think that is what people need to hear, but we need to apply it to your real life and legal experiences. Let me talk to you about a case where you were involved in as a private attorney.
Today, there are about 45 million uninsured people in America. Too often Americans with insurance can’t receive coverage for medically necessary procedures and have to fight the insurance companies. In my home State of Illinois, we have a law called the Illinois Health Maintenance Organization Act. I think you are familiar with it. It provides that if a patient’s primary care physician deems a proposed procedure to be medically necessary but their HMO disagrees and denies coverage for the procedure, the patient may have the HMO’s decision reviewed by an outside physician, the determination of that outside physician binding on the HMO.
You challenged this law on behalf of an HMO that refused to pay $95,000 for the shoulder surgery of Debra Moran of my State of Illinois. The case went to the Supreme Court in 2002. You argued for Rush Prudential, and you argued they weren’t subject to the Illinois law governing HMOs because, you said, they weren’t really an insurance company.
You claimed that since the HMO was not providing health care but merely a promise to pay for health care, it was exempt. Thankfully, from my point of view, you lost the case. If you had won it, it would have put millions of American consumers and families at risk of losing coverage for necessary health care.
Judge Roberts, did you have any reservations about taking this case?
Judge ROBERTS. No, Senator, I did not. The result in the case, I did lose. I lost 5–4, if I’m remembering correctly. In other words, four of the Justices on the Supreme Court thought the argument we were—I was making on behalf of my client was correct. It has always been my position that I do not sit in judgment other than once I’ve satisfied myself that the legal arguments are reasonable ones, within the mainstream, if you will, that I don’t decide whether that’s the way I would rule as a judge or whether I would rule the other way.
My practice has been to take the cases that come to me, and if the other side in that case had come to me first, I would have taken their side.

Senator DURBIN. So you didn’t step back at any point in your practice and say, ‘‘No, I am not going to do this. I can’t be associated with a case or a cause, even though it may be legal and ethical, that might cause so much harm to so many innocent people’’?
Judge ROBERTS. That’s a judgment for the legal system to make. They’re asserting legal rights. Lawyers aren’t judges when they’re representing clients. They don’t sit there and say—or maybe some do. I don’t. I think it’s a basic fundamental principle of the legal system and the bar that you take clients who have reasonable arguments—now, I’m not talking about frivolous arguments. I don’t take cases in which those are raised. But the lawyers aren’t the judges. The judges are.
Now, the case you mentioned, you’ve explained the arguments on one side. There were legal arguments on the other side, and four Justices agreed with those. This isn’t an extreme case when it’s decided 5–4. And that’s one of the very points I was making earlier, that I take cases on all sides of the issue. You can go through and find cases. For example, when I was asked to assist an inmate on Florida’s death row, I didn’t step back and say, Well, is this really a good thing for me to assist this individual guilty of—convicted of particular murders? I took the case. When the various pro bono activities in which my firm was involved, I didn’t sit in judgment and say, Is that something I agree with? Is it not something I agree with?
I was a lawyer involved in that area of the law, and I thought it my obligation to take the cases that come in.
Senator DURBIN. Many of the organizations that oppose your nomination represent minorities in America. You have the distinction of being opposed by LULAC. This, of course, is the first time this Hispanic organization has ever opposed a Supreme Court nominee. You are also opposed by MALDEF. I personally think that their feelings go beyond the ‘‘illegal amigos’’ comment that you talked about yesterday. And I want to point you to one particular area that they find troubling, when I speak to them, and I find troubling. And it goes back to the case of Plyler v. Doe, a 1982 Supreme Court case, that held it unconstitutional to deny elementary education to children on the basis of their immigration status. It was a Texas case where the Court struck down the Texas law and allowed elementary schools, 23 years ago, to refuse entrance to undocumented children.
On the day the case was decided—and I think the timing is important here, because it appears to be kind of a gratuitous comment. It isn’t as if you were asked for an opinion. On the day it was decided, you coauthored a memo that criticized the Solicitor General’s office for failing to file a brief supporting the Texas law which would have refused education to these children. Your memo disagreed with the administration’s position on the case, so it isn’t as if you were arguing the Reagan administration’s position. They had taken a different position on the case.
Can you describe your involvement in the case? And I guess more importantly, can you describe now how you feel about this today, 23 years later, when the largest—
Judge ROBERTS. Well—

Senator DURBIN. I will just finish, and I will leave you the time you need to answer. When the largest, fastest-growing segment of America’s population is Hispanic, when the major Hispanic organizations feel that this showed real insensitivity to who they were and what their children needed? Can you explain that memo that really wasn’t part of the Reagan agenda? Why did you say this?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think, Senator, if I’m remembering the memo—and it was 23 years ago, and the case that was decided was, I believe, again, a divided decision by the Supreme Court. If I’m remembering the memo correctly, it was making the point that the position was inconsistent with the Attorney General’s litigation policy approach, if that’s the right memorandum.
Senator DURBIN. It is. Judge ROBERTS. Well, in that case, again, as a staff lawyer, I thought it was my obligation to call to the Attorney General’s attention activities in the Department that I thought were inconsistent with what he had articulated as his approach. And that is what I would have been doing in that case. And, again, it would have been apparently supporting the State of Texas in its legislative determination in that area. Senator DURBIN. Well, did you agree with the decision then? Or do you agree with it now? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t—I haven’t looked at the decision in Plyler v. Doe in 23 years, Senator, and there is nothing gratuitous about the memorandum. It obviously came out because the decision came out. That would have been why I was advising the Attorney General with respect to it. Obviously, the importance of the availability of education for all is vital. That’s a different question than the legal issues involved and whether a State law should be struck down. Senator DURBIN. Twenty-three years later, millions of children have benefited from this decision. They have been educated in America. Many have gone on to become citizens. Some are business people. Some are professionals. Some are serving in our military today because Plyler was decided in a way that you apparently disagreed with 23 years ago. So my question to you: For the Hispanic groups that oppose your nomination, what is your feeling? Is this settled law as far as you are concerned about our commitment in education in this country? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, as I said, I have not looked at the decision in Plyler v. Doe in 23 years. It’s not an area that I’ve focused on. And the issue is not my policy view about what is a good idea for educational policy or national policy or whether what the Texas legislators determined was a good idea for Texas policy. The question was a particular legal issue, and, again, the Supreme Court was divided on that, so it is not as if we are talking about a position outside the mainstream. And what I was explaining, this was viewed, as the memo states, if it were looked at in full, it was something that I thought was inconsistent with what I understood the Attorney General’s approach to be, and it was my job to call that to his attention, which is what I did. Senator DURBIN. Okay. I think you have taken refuge in the fact that you were working for someone. The fact that this memo came out the day after the decision I think is an important circumstance.

392
But let me go back to the beginning, the first question, the first day with Senator Specter. Wouldn’t it be a jolt to the system in America if we decided that we would no longer offer education to these children?
Judge ROBERTS. Of course. Well, of course, Senator. Senator DURBIN. And so— Judge ROBERTS. And then the decision in Plyler is a precedent of the Court. I don’t think it—I’m not aware that it’s been called into question in the intervening 23 years that have passed since the time I wrote those two paragraphs in the memo. And that is a precedent that is entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. And it’s something that is where I would begin if an issue arose in this area. I’m not aware that any is arising in this area, but if an issue were to arise, that’s where I would begin, with the precedent that— Senator DURBIN. I just think that millions of Americans would like to have heard you say I think it is a good idea, I am glad we did it for America. But if you can’t say it, you can’t. Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, if I could just make the point that the issue is not whether or not I thought it was a good idea. That’s not the job of a lawyer presenting legal advice and legal—the legal implications of an issue to his boss, the Attorney General. He wasn’t interested in whether I thought it was a good idea or not. He was interested in the legal question of whether or not this was consistent with his policy and his approach. That’s not taking refuge. That’s explaining the circumstances of a memorandum. And it’s not avoiding an expression about whether it’s a good idea or not. It’s explaining that what we’re dealing with— Senator DURBIN. But you have been unequivocal in your statements supporting Brown v. Board of Education. No one has suggested, in any respectable way, that we should return to the bad old days of separate but equal. I mean, you have accepted that is part of America. And the point I am trying to make to you is, whether we are talking about millions of uninsured people or millions of Hispanic children, I would think that it would be a basic value. You would say this is good for America, for people to have insurance, and bad for them to be denied. It is good for America to see children with education rather than to see them in the streets ignorant. It seems so fundamental. Judge ROBERTS. Senator, do you—I don’t think you want judges who will decide cases before them under the law on what they think is good, simply good policy for America. There are legal questions there. And I’m sure there are clients that I have represented in court that you would agree with. You would say that’s the right side of the cause to be on, whether it’s the environmental interests I represented in the Tahoe case, whether it’s the welfare recipients I represented pro bono in the Bivens case, whether it’s the cause of the inmate on death row that I assisted in in Florida, whether it’s the environmental interests in Glacier Bay that I represented or in the Grand Canyon on a pro bono basis. I’m sure I could go down my list of clients and find clients that you would say that’s the right side, that’s the cause of justice, and there are others with whom you disagree.

393
My point is simply this, that in representing clients, in serving as a lawyer, it’s not my job to decide whether that’s a good idea or a bad idea. The job of the lawyer is to articulate the legal arguments on behalf of the client.
Senator DURBIN. I am just trying to get to the bottom line about your values. If it is strictly a question about whether this is a legal and ethical—an ethical legal question that can be contested, then there are many positions you can take in the law. Some I wouldn’t be comfortable with, some you may not be comfortable with.
Let me ask you one other question. Senators Coburn and Brownback have, I think, sincerely and accurately expressed their views on the issue of abortion. I think they have been very articulate in saying so. Many would argue that it is one of the most divisive legal and political issues we faced in our generation. I would like to ask you this question. Why do you think this issue is so important to so many women in America, the whole question of Roe v. Wade, the question of reproductive freedom, and the question of freedom of choice? Why do you think it is so important?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think it’s important, and again, to women on both sides of the issue and also, I think, to men as well, but obviously it’s an issue that directly affects women. It’s a fundamental question, as the Court has addressed in Roe and in Casey, that obviously affects the lives directly of millions of Americans, and the availability of rights under that decision affects women. But I know there are people of strongly held views on both sides of the issue. And I know that the responsibility of a judge confronting this issue is to decide the case according to the rule of law consistent with the precedents, not to take sides in a dispute as a matter of policy, but to decide it according to the law.
And to the extent that your questions earlier about, you know, causes we agree with, causes we don’t agree with, I do want to emphasize that there is a unifying theme in my approach, both as a lawyer and as a judge. And that is the cause that I believe in passionately, the one to which I have devoted my professional career, is the vindication of the rule of law. And I tried to explain in my opening statement on Monday why that’s important. Because without it, any other rights that you may agree with as a matter of policy are meaningless. You need to have courts that will enforce the rule of law if you’re going to have rights that mean anything.
Senator DURBIN. I am running out of time, but I do want to give you an opportunity. Last night I passed a memo along to you relative to the Bob Jones University case. I don’t know if you have had a chance to look at it and can tell me whether that is your handwriting on that memo, whether you were in fact in a meeting involving the Bob Jones University decision with the Reagan administration. Did you provide any input in the meeting or have any conversations with Justice Department personnel about the case?
Judge ROBERTS. It is my handwriting. It’s a list. It’s apparently a meeting to discuss a number of civil rights issues, six of them, I see. I did not participate in any way in the Bob Jones case. It was apparently discussed, according to this memo, at the meeting. The recusal rule that was at issue says that I shouldn’t participate by way of consultation or advice, and I did not.
Senator DURBIN. Thank you for clarifying that.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Durbin. Senator Brownback? Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Judge Roberts, again. Mr. Chairman, I want to enter into the record something that has been cited to already but sent yesterday from the ABA, the statement by the unanimous opinion of the ABA that Judge John Roberts is well qualified for the position of Chief Justice of the United States. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Senator BROWNBACK. Judge Roberts, I would note now you have been here for 18 hours and 30 minutes of testimony. Just as a reference, because people like statistics and records, Justice Breyer was here for 18 hours and he was through. You may have the end in sight, but you are not there yet, and you are going to pass Justice Breyer and perhaps others. I want to take you back to the First Amendment. This is an area that I have just not understood where the Court has been going. I hope you are willing to explain some of this jurisprudence, or at least give me your thoughts on how the Court got to where they did on these issues. The First Amendment, everybody knows, requires that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. It is wellknown, well-regarded, and broadly interpreted by the courts. In the four years, the Court had sternly disapproved of restrictions upon certain forms of speech such as virtual child pornography. The Court said you can’t do that, limit that speech. Tobacco advertising. The Court said you can’t limit that speech. Dissemination of illegally intercepted communications. You can’t limit that speech. Sexually explicit cable programming. You can’t limit that speech. So the Court has been, it seems to me, very pronounced in this area of free speech, basically telling the Congress you can’t limit it. The Court even extended this to the issue of virtual child pornography. The case of Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition. I want to describe this in a little bit of detail because I want to then ask another question associated with it. In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, the Court struck down a congressional statute regulating pornography, in this case the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996, and expanded the Federal prohibition on pornography to include virtual child pornography, realistic images which were made without the use of actual children. Congress based its opinion on the chance that pedophiles would use this material to recruit individuals over the Internet to draw in children into sexual activity. We found out about that, investigated it, held a number of hearings, and said we have to stop this stuff. But now, the Court says you can’t do it; it is a limitation on free speech. Then, not long ago—as a matter of fact, the opinion was issued in 2003—we had a big debate on campaign finance reform in front of the Congress. One of the members of our Committee, Senator Feingold, was one of the lead sponsors of the McCain-Feingold legislation. It came in front of the courts, McConnell v. Federal Elec-

tion Commission, and the Court largely upheld the McCain-Feingold law, one section of which did the following: prohibited corporations, labor unions, and other organizations from political advertisement that mentioned a specific candidate or office-holder within 60 days of a general election. You are probably very familiar with this legislation.
This was a big national debate. Under the Court’s decision, this congressional action prohibiting speech—and not just any speech, and not just pornography—political speech close to the time when people are making decisions on elections—was constitutional.
The Court decided that this congressional action prohibiting political speech could be upheld under a First Amendment ostensibly designed to protect this form of political participation and speech. I looked at that. I voted for the McCain-Feingold law. I did not think there was any way the Court would hold that this provision is constitutional because it limits political free speech right when people are making their decision.
One of leading abilities we have in this country is to be able to criticize the Government, particularly at a point when it matters the most right before elections. How do you square such a broad interpretation of the First Amendment in these cases and such a limitation on political free speech? Can you explain that to me?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I’m not sure that I can put the two together side by side and talk about it other than to say that I think the Court tends to address each case on its own terms, and in the case of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, I do know that we’re dealing there with an extraordinarily extensive record in that case. The judicial opinions addressing the issue before three-judge District Court I know went on for several hundred pages, just dealing with records and the issues involved, the record that had been developed, including before Congress.
My reading of the Court’s opinion in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act case is that that was a case where the Court’s decision was driven in large part by the record that had been compiled by Congress. I think the determination there was based—just reading the opinion, there’s no great insight—that the extensive record carried a lot of weight with the Justices.
Now, with respect to the other areas, again, I think the Court would tend to look at those, sort of put the one case aside and then move on to the next case, and they’re dealing there with developments in that area, and again I—
Senator BROWNBACK. Does this not strike you as odd, these two decisions side by side under the same First Amendment?
Judge ROBERTS. Only in the sense, Senator, that obviously they come out different ways, and your point that the political speech is generally regarded as at the core of what the First Amendment was designed to protect, and some of the other speeches is not. I certainly appreciate that concern, but whether—again, whether the particular cases were correctly decided or not is not something I feel is appropriate for me to discuss.
Senator BROWNBACK. I looked at those and they just did not make much sense. If you are going to read the First Amendment expansively, which I agree with, that reading should be consistently applied.

I want to go to an issue that is likely to come before you, and I recognize you are not going to give a pre-opinion on it, but I just want to make a point in talking about it. That is the issue of marriage and its definition by the courts, and taking the issue of marriage from legislative bodies to the Court. This is one of the most driving issues in the political environment in the United States today.
If the Court comes in and trumps the Congress and State legislatures on this issue and says legislative bodies cannot decide this issue because it is as a matter of constitutional law, it will create an enormous jolt in the system and potentially change a series of marriage laws that have been passed by legislative bodies. Fortyfive of our 50 States have passed either constitutional amendments or statutes that preserve the traditional definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman. It has been addressed in all regions of the country.
I bring it up to you because a Federal court has now ruled on this issue. In Nebraska, one Federal judge has said that the Nebraska constitutional amendment violates the U.S. Constitution. Now all the States are rushing to pass constitutional amendments, but everybody is scared of what the U.S. Supreme Court is going to do. Nebraska passed its State constitutional amendment by a 70 percent vote of the Nebraskan people. These are good-hearted, good people. They want to try to do what is right.
One Federal judge comes in and throws all these Federal constitutional issues on it saying it: violated the First Amendment right to free association; violated equal protection guaranties; and then—I do not know where he got this one—represented an unconstitutional bill of attainder, which is legislation drafted at a particular individual.
I just hope if you are confirmed on the Court that you would look at what happens if the Court comes in and stomps on this issue that has stirred up so much discussion.
These are issues properly left to legislative bodies and people to shape, to look at, to debate and to consider, and left to movement back and forth within the legislative arenas. If you come in and you say there is a constitutional right to a broader definition of marriage, and the Court says that is the way it is going to be, it takes something out of the system that should be there—discussion—it should be allowed to mature there.
And we will be here years later like we are in the series of Roe cases, where after 30 years now there is not more acceptance of the rule opinion, but there is less acceptance in America. This will not be like Brown v. Board of Education, where after it was resolved society says, ‘‘Okay, that was the right way to go,’’ and we would all say that today. Roe has gone the other way, and this would create another issue like that in Roe if it is picked up and stomped on by the courts.
I want to talk with you on another issue and just get your opinion of another area of the Constitution.
You would agree under the Constitution that Congress has the power to appropriate money?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. The Framers regarded that as the basis legislative power, the power of the purse.

Senator BROWNBACK. And that that power is not given to the judiciary, it is given to the legislative branch of Government?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Alexander Hamilton, in making his point— I think it was Hamilton—that this was the least dangerous branch, emphasized that the courts have neither the power of the sword nor the power of the purse.
Senator BROWNBACK. I want to point out to you—that this is happening in State judiciaries; this is happening and being considered now in the U.S. Federal courts. You will have in front of you a case regarding the Solomon amendment that was considered here. A recent Third Circuit Court of Appeals case struck down the Solomon amendment on constitutional grounds. Jerry Solomon, a long-term Member of Congress, a wonderful gentleman, who has since passed away, had conditioned a university’s receipt of Federal funds on the university’s granting equal access to the military for purposes of recruiting students. This amendment was passed by Congress.
It basically said, you need to allow military personnel access if you want to receive Federal funds. It was considered by Congress, and it was passed. The Third Circuit struck down the Solomon amendment on constitutional grounds. The decision has been appealed to you.
I obviously do not want you to declare your position on this. I would ask you, if you can state the obvious one first, that we have the role of the power of the purse here in the Congress, not in the judiciary. May the Congress attach conditions to the receipt of Federal funds?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Congress historically has done that. The Spending Clause power, for example, South Dakota v. Dole said that if you accept Federal Highway funds, you have to raise the drinking age to 21, and that was upheld by the Supreme Court. So certainly as a general proposition the Congress has that authority. I consider it a case involving a waiver of sovereign immunity. The condition on the receipt of Federal funds was that Washington’s Metro system waive its sovereign immunity with respect to disability claims, and by a 2–1 vote we upheld that exercise of authority under the Spending Clause.
Senator BROWNBACK. The Solomon amendment will be in front of you if you are confirmed, and obviously you cannot comment on it. It is just that if the courts start appropriating money through this route, the rub between the systems and the branches of Government I think will be absolutely extraordinary, and Congress will find more and more innovative ways to limit the judiciary. It is not healthy for the system and it is certainly not healthy for the judiciary if it goes further into the business of appropriating funds. It bleeds down through the system. It is not just in the U.S. Supreme Court. It goes through the State court systems as well, and I would hope that that right of the Congress would be respected with adequate judicial restraint, as you noted this morning, that being the major check on the judiciary, though I think we can limit what the judiciary can review under the Constitution.
I want to make—in the limited time I have left—just two quick points. One is on the end-of-life issues. You have had a discussion with several members on end-of-life issues. This was discussed

Washington v. Glucksberg the leading recent case from 1997, which upheld a State statute banning assisted suicide.
Would you agree that that case held that there is not a constitutional right to die—a right to die does not exist in the Constitution?
Judge ROBERTS. I think that’s an accurate conclusion of the holding in that case. Again, without expressing views on correctness or not, since that’s where the line has been drawn in terms of what nominees can say, my understanding is that that court rejected the conclusion. It went through the analysis of what liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause included, and it concluded that there wasn’t a right under the Liberty Clause that trumped the regulation that was at issue in that case.
Senator BROWNBACK. I believe the standard that the Court held in this case was the rationally—related standard, the lowest level of review—that if the State can find a rational basis, they can limit these assisted suicide laws, efforts across the country.
Judge ROBERTS. Once the Court concluded that there wasn’t a fundamental right that was in conflict with the State regulation, then the Court applied the rational relation test to uphold the State law.
Senator BROWNBACK. That would be subject to, in your opinion, the continued status of stare decisis as an opinion of the Court, and the deference and the dependency that the society has had on that ruling, would have the same status as any opinion of the us Supreme Court on the basis of stare decisis in your opinion?
Judge ROBERTS. It would be subject to the same analysis as any other precedent of the Court, yes.
Senator BROWNBACK. Regardless whether it is a recent opinion or a later opinion, this has the same standing because it is an opinion of the Court’s?
Judge ROBERTS. Some of the Court’s cases talk about how long an opinion has been standing. Some of the Court’s cases say that is less of a factor, but it is a decision of the Court, a precedent on that issue. Any question of revisiting it would have to be consistent with the principles of stare decisis, and we have talked about those principles and how they apply.
Senator BROWNBACK. Yes. I wanted to make clear that it doesn’t matter the length of time the opinion has set or the number of times it has been revisited, stare decisis is a basic principle that applies to any opinion previously held by the Court.
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator BROWNBACK. I would note this is an opinion put forward, as you get from a lot of us, that these are issues that are very difficult, and they are ones that are actually quite well suited for the legislative process to discuss because you have different views of life. Is life sacred, per se, or is it subject to some sort of objective review? It is a very difficult issue here in this body and across the country, and it is one that has a lot of emotion, and it is a very important issue for the society itself to talk through. I want to talk about a separate hat you would carry as the Chief Justice of the United States, and that is as the head of the Judicial Conference of the United States. I’d like to ask you about court reorganization. There have been proposals put forward to split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the far western circuit, a very large

circuit. There are discussions in the Congress about splitting that circuit in two because of its size, its caseload, and a number of other factors that have been proffered or put forward.
You would agree that under Article I, section 8, that Congress has the power to constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator. Senator BROWNBACK. And that these inferior courts would include such things as the circuit court and the lower district courts of the Federal Government? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator BROWNBACK. So that Congress would have the power under the Constitution to split the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals? Judge ROBERTS. I know that Congress did just that with respect to the old Fifth Circuit, which used to run from Florida out through Texas, and they split it into the new Fifth Circuit and the 11th Circuit. I don’t think any questions have been raised about Congress’s authority to do that. Senator BROWNBACK. And you do not raise those here as the head of the Judicial Conference of the United States? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I wouldn’t want to— Senator BROWNBACK. Some potential role there. Judge ROBERTS.—just yet, but I’m not aware of any objections to Congress’s authority. I don’t think that’s the issue. I know the judges have various views on whether it’s a good idea of not, and since it affects them, I know some of the judges have expressed those views. But the question of congressional authority to do that is not something I’ve seen raised. Senator BROWNBACK. I thank you. Judge Roberts, this will be my last chance to interact with you this way. I do commend you. I also just note to you that a lot of hopes and prayers are riding on you from a lot of people across this country and around the world. It is just such an incredible important time with so many big issues that I think I can speak for millions of people in saying that. So godspeed to you and your family. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Brownback. Judge Roberts, would you care to take a break at this time? Judge ROBERTS. No, I am fine. Chairman SPECTER. Sure? Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Leahy says you are the only one, but that is good. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Coburn. Senator COBURN. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, I will try not to take my 20 minutes. I have heard a little trend that I think needs to be dispelled. I have heard it put forth that you might not be fair to women. I have heard it put forth that you might not be fair to minorities or Latinos. I have heard that you might not be fair to those people with AIDS. And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to just put into the record about six different documents here that clarify the record on Judge Roberts’s action on affirmative, on disability rights, on civil rights, on wom-

en’s rights, actually, his involvement in the University of Richmond v. Bell, Title IX, and also his Title VII employment discrimination record that I think refutes the underlying tone that I have heard here that is very disturbing to me.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, Senator Coburn, they will all be made part of the record.
Senator COBURN. And the reason it is disturbing to me is I want lawyers who will take the wrong cases for the right people to preserve our country. And the very fact that you may have taken a case that some other lawyer might not view as right is the very thing that makes the justice system work. And one of the things that you have reaffirmed is one of the reasons we have people not having equal justice under the law is sometimes they do not have qualified attorneys that will do that.
So, first of all, kudos to you. Number two, the fact that you write positions as a staff lawyer, young—I remember what I was like when I was 25, and it was not very pretty. Some people say it is not very pretty now. I also would remind you that you got another 5 years from Senator Feinstein. She said you would be on there 40 years, so all power to you.
But the fact is I have noticed something that I really do not appreciate, and that is this kind of trend to say that you are not a kind, not a considerate person, the fact that you have a wife that is an attorney and a young daughter that is going to be into this world, that you wouldn’t believe that they ought to have equal rights, that you don’t believe in hiring practices that are fair, you don’t believe in treating people fairly. On the basis of a flimsy record—and I want the American people to know that that record doesn’t hold up to the smell test that has been presented here today. And it is a little bit disturbing to me because it is this subtle way of trying to say you are not who you really are. And you have not been able to defend yourself in that because you cannot comment without creating a problem for you in terms of being a fair Justice. So you are kind of in a double bind, and I want you to know that I want to defend that, because I don’t think it is appropriate.
The other thing is I want to enter into the record both the chronology of cases that Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg decided after they met with the White House, the Clinton White House, before they were nominated. There was a total of, on Justice Breyer, seven cases, on Justice Ginsburg, five cases. The implication that you are not ethical is the other subtle implication that comes across there. And I find it tremendously uncomfortable that that is the trend where this is going.
The other thing I want to address for you and the American public, Senator Schumer yesterday quoted some statements that were made, which a lot of people do not agree with, and you did not identify with, Tony Perkins at the Family Research Council and others. The fact that they made those statements, whether we agree with them or not, is not the important thing. The important thing is that the Court is losing the confidence of the American people or they never would have said that. These are not bad people. These are people with a perception that says, you know, what is going on here?

Let me just list for a minute why they might think that. We had today a judge in California say you can’t use ‘‘under God’’ in the Pledge. The abortion issue we have talked about. Homosexual marriage we have talked about. The fact that the judges have said online pornography is fine, regardless of what the Congress has said. Parents who know that their 12-year-old daughter can be given oral contraceptives without their permission and an IUD in many places without their permission, but they cannot be given an aspirin.
You know, these very crucial issues—not to say they are right or wrong, but how we got to the decision is causing some Americans to lose confidence. And as you and I spoke in my office, one of my greatest concerns—and I asked you, How do we build that back up? How do we build the confidence of the American people back in the Court? And part of that is the work of getting more consistent, more unanimous opinions, but also it is making sure the Court does what it should do and the legislature does what it should do. And I don’t want you to feel committed to me at all. And I don’t want to influence. I am very pleased that every time you are going to look at the law, look at the precedents, look at the facts, look at the litigants, and then work with the other Justices to try to do what is under the law, the Constitution, our Constitution, and our statutes.
So the only question I would have for you is this one final one, and I will finish, I hope, before 10 minutes are consumed. Where did our law—would you teach the American public where our law came from? I mean, there was law before the American Revolution. What did our law come from? What did—where did it come from?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, before the Revolution, of course, we were under the British legal system.
Senator COBURN. And before that? Judge ROBERTS. Go back under the legal system in Britain to the Magna Carta and the dispute between the King and the lords there as they tried to establish their rights against the King or the central government, was a key part of the development of English law since that time. Senator COBURN. And prior to that? Some of the input to that was what some people—these very people who are worried—these very people who have lost confidence—call natural law. The ideas came from somewhere, didn’t they? Like don’t kill somebody, don’t steal from them, be truthful. Where did those come from? Those came from the natural tendencies of what we were taught in beliefs through the years that would best support a society. There is a theological component to that to many people. But the fact is there is a basis for the laws that we have, and it has proven consistent through the years, even as it comes to America, that if we enforce those tenets, we all are better off. And I just want to tell you that I believe you have been very strong today, just, first of all, to tolerate this and the amount of time. A final point, and I have 12 minutes and 25 seconds, and I will be through. You also were accused of—not accused. You were also questioned about your advice on a speech that the President was going to make on HIV. And I would like to put into the record, at

that time, first of all, the best-known and best-loved Surgeon General of this country did not make a decision on that issue until 12 months after your memo, but also at the same time, the Washington Post 2 or 3 days prior to that had published—or after that, had published an article talking about the very questions you were raising that may not be true. And so with unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, I would like to have that introduced, the Washington Post article, September 4, 1985.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made part of the record.
Senator COBURN. And with that, 11 minutes and 34 seconds, I am done and thank you, Judge Roberts.
Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn, especially for yielding back time. Senator Feinstein, you are recognized now for 15 minutes. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Just to correct the record, to begin with, the Gun-Free Schools Zone Act was amended as part of the Omnibus Fiscal Year 1997 Appropriations bill and the jurisdictional requirement was added to the Act. So it is the law. And from my point of view, that is very good. I would like to finish up some questions I have. Let me, in trying to sort of get at you the man, as opposed to you the jurist, ask you something that the late Senator Simon, Paul Simon, asked Justice Ginsburg. He asked this: ‘‘Theodore Roosevelt, in a 1913 speech— this is after he had been President—said this: ‘Our judges have been on the whole both able and upright public servants, but their whole training and the aloofness of their position on the bench prevent their having, as a rule, any real knowledge of or understanding sympathy with the lives and needs of the ordinary hardworking toiler.’ ‘‘I think that is a danger for jurists, and probably no place is at a greater danger than on the U.S. Supreme Court, where you really are isolated, and where, when you meet people, they will tend to be people of power and wealth, and not people who are unemployed, not people who have many of the problems that Americans face. Have you reflected on this at all, either in your present tenure or future tenure? How can this nominee make sure that she stays in touch with the problems real people have out there? ’’ Judge ROBERTS. That is something that I thought about, Senator, at greater length before I came onto the court of appeals as little more than 2 years ago. I think it’s a common concern, that judges are isolated. There’s some natural tendency to that. You find that lawyers that you used to socialize with don’t feel they can talk to you anymore, and other people, again, a certain distance develops. And it is something that my wife and I talked about at the time. And I concluded, and she made the point, that it was a great blessing to me to have our children. They will obviously keep us in touch with things outside of the isolation of the law. There are a lot of soccer games and swim meets and things of that sort in my future for the next 15 years and I’ll be seeing people not just involved with the law, not just involved with the Court, but other parents and other children in those activities. And I think that will

be a very healthy part of an effort to keep in touch with things outside the isolated marble palaces.
Senator FEINSTEIN. But I would hypothesize that if it is just through your children, it is still going to be a very limited segment of society.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, sure, Senator, but there have always been areas in which I’ve continued to be active that keep me involved with other people. I mentioned, I think yesterday, the Street Law Program that I’ve been a part of for more than 15 years, which—
Senator FEINSTEIN. And you will continue that? Judge ROBERTS. I certainly will. I continued that when I became a judge and plan on continuing it as well. It’s jointly sponsored by the Supreme Court Historical Society, and that brings high school teachers. And I’ve always found that extremely rewarding because they have a very different perspective. They’re obviously dealing with children a little further along at that stage, but they’re not lawyers. And they’re here to try to understand the law. And I have always enjoyed very much their questions and sharing with them why the Supreme Court is so important to the rule of law, and allowing them the opportunity. They go in and they see the Court in action, as it were, and then they go back. And it helps them talk to their students about something that I think is critically important for those students to know. Senator FEINSTEIN. Do you see yourself mixing with people in some of the harder places in our country? Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s hard to look ahead and see how that would work. I have as—I know, for example, when I was a lawyer and handling a case about native village rights in Alaska, I went to the native villages. I’ve always thought that was an important part about understanding the real-world consequences of any case—to get on the ground. When I handled a case involving people on the assembly line, I went to the assembly line and saw what it was like. I went to these villages that you could only reach by boat or by plane, where they make do with so little because of the remoteness. And I’ve always viewed that as an important part of understanding any case that I’ve been involved in. Senator FEINSTEIN. The reason I ask that is because I had a question about the Plyler case which question I was going to ask you. And I have your memo, because I was really surprised by it as well. Let me ask you this question. It is signed by Carolyn Kuhl, and your name is second. Judge ROBERTS. Oh. Senator FEINSTEIN. Does that mean you wrote the memo or did not write it? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I’d have to just say I don’t know who wrote it. It obviously was submitted by both of us. I don’t remember. Senator FEINSTEIN. You submitted it, right. But her name is on top. I was just curious because clearly the purpose of this memo is to try to get one Justice, namely Justice Powell, over on your side. But the concluding part—I just don’t understand why you would say this, and perhaps you would believe today it was wrong. Let me quote: ‘‘As you will recall, the Solicitor General’s Office had decided not to take a position before the Supreme Court on the
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00415 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

404
Equal Protection issue in this case. The briefs for the State of Texas were quite poor. It is our belief that a brief filed by the Solicitor General’s Office supporting the State of Texas and the values of judicial restraint could well have moved Justice Powell into the Chief Justice’s camp and altered the outcome in the case. In sum, this is a case in which our supposed litigation program to encourage judicial restraint did not get off the ground, and should have.’’
Now, this concerns, regardless of what the briefs were, whether children should be educated in our country. I come from a huge immigrant State. We are 36 million people. We probably have at least 12 million immigrants. Maybe three to five million people here illegally, in our State. To say that this vast number of children shouldn’t be allowed to be educated, I would be surprised you would write that kind of—
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I don’t know if it was from both of us. I don’t know who wrote it. If my name is on it, it’s on it. But I agree, of course, that children should be educated. The example I just gave of my activities with the Street Law Program focuses on the importance of education for children. The legal issues presented in that case and the question of whether or not it was consistent with the Attorney General’s litigation approach and program, those are different questions from the basic issue of whether children should be educated.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, could I do this? Could I give this to you? Because I have 15 minutes tomorrow. Could I ask you to read it?
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly. Senator FEINSTEIN. I would really like to know whether you think this way today. And I will ask that question tomorrow. And attached to it is the Congressional Research Service analysis of it. If you wouldn’t mind— Judge ROBERTS. Not at all. Happy to. Senator FEINSTEIN.—I will do this. Let me ask you a question about strict scrutiny and affirmative action. You mention in several of your memos from the Reagan administration addressing affirmative action that the Government should be color blind. And I would agree. And I wish we were there, but we are not there. And because America is well-served by educating all her people well, do you personally subscribe not to quotas but to measured efforts that can withstand strict scrutiny? Judge ROBERTS. A measured effort that can withstand strict scrutiny is, I think, a—affirmative action of that sort, I think, is a very position approach. And I think people will disagree about exactly what the details should be, but the general notion— Senator FEINSTEIN. Such as Michigan, the University of Michigan— Judge ROBERTS. In Michigan. In the Michigan case, obviously, you have—I always get the—whether it’s the law school—I think the law school program was upheld and the university program was struck down because of the differences in the program. But efforts to ensure the full participation in all aspects of our society by people without regard to their race, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs—all of those are efforts that I think are appropriate. At the time of the Reagan administration, President Reagan was at pains

405
to make clear, and I know the Attorney General was as well, that in opposing quotas—and at the time, it was a much stricter quota approach that was being proposed, set-asides—they were not in any way opposed to what they regarded as beneficial affirmative action to bring minorities, women into all aspects of society. That’s important, and as the Court has explained, we all benefit from that.
Senator FEINSTEIN. I want to go back to the ‘‘hapless toad.’’ It still bothers me. I asked you some questions about it yesterday. Let me ask you instead, because I am trying to get at it one way or another, the factors you would consider in making determinations on the scope of congressional power under the Commerce Clause. In Viejo, you addressed whether the survival of the endangered toad substantially affects interstate commerce.
In National Association of Home Builders v. Babbitt, a case you call into question in Rancho Viejo, the D.C. Circuit followed the Wickard cumulative test and looked at whether the protection of all endangered species substantially impacts interstate commerce. The D.C. Circuit noted that although it is difficult to know the commercial impact of an individual species, in the aggregate we can be certain that the extinction of species and the attendant decline in biodiversity will have a real and predictable effect on interstate commerce.
In order to determine whether the Endangered Species Act regulates activity that substantially affects interstate commerce, should the courts look at the impact on interstate commerce of each individual species, or the cumulative impact of all species that are protected?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, first of all— Senator FEINSTEIN. Do you think you can answer that? Judge ROBERTS. I can, Senator. But I do need to clarify. At the beginning you said something that, what I did in the Rancho Viejo case, and that was not what I did. The only thing that I did in my opinion—and again, there was another opinion that analyzed it and made a determination of whether it was constitutional. I did not join that opinion determining that it was unconstitutional. I simply said that we need to look at these other grounds on which to sustain the Endangered Species Act. We should consider it en banc. There was another court suggesting that our approach was inconsistent with the Supreme Court opinions. When I was confirmed for the court of appeals, everybody wanted to know will you follow the Supreme Court opinions? And I told you I would. And here we have a court of appeals suggesting you’re not following them, and I said, well, let’s take the case en banc. I did not state an opinion on whether the Commerce Clause requirement was satisfied or not. I said let’s take it en banc and consider these other grounds. The other grounds went to precisely the issue and the question that you asked. If we had looked at it under the other grounds, which was the commercial activity surrounding the endangered species, in other words, the issue that one other court of appeals had said, for example, there is commercial activity surrounding endangered species that takes place nationwide, not limited to where the particular species is, and that would satisfy the commercial activity require-

ment and allow the Court to apply Wickard under the Supreme Court’s precedents—
Senator FEINSTEIN. Which is tough duty when you get down to, let’s say, a really endangered species where you have very few of the species remaining. Perhaps they had been in a number of different States.
Judge ROBERTS. That was the problem that was presented—as my opinion tried to set forth, that’s the problem that was presented with the approach that the panel took, and I thought we ought to re-hear it and look at these other grounds where you don’t have to ask whether there is impact on interstate commerce from the particular species, the very point you—
Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me tell you what is bothering me, is that it sets a prelude for the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, in those areas, again, the commercial impact of pollution, those are things that I think are not going to present as difficult an issue remotely as if you look at each individual species. The whole point of my argument in the dissent was there was another way to look at this that would allow you to not have to look at the interstate impact of the one particular species. They were grounds that the Court in a panel opinion said they did not have to reach because they had taken this other approach that the Fifth Circuit was suggesting was inconsistent with our approach. And all I said—and, again, it is important to recognize, I did not say that even in this case the decision was wrong, that it was unconstitutional. Another judge dissenting did say that. I did not join that opinion. I simply said let’s look at these other grounds for decision because that doesn’t present this problem.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you for clearing that up. I appreciate it.
Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Schumer? Senator Schumer, you are recognized for 15 minutes. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, thank you for allowing us to go on with the questioning. I just want to make a comment and then I will get into the questions, because in our last round you had mentioned something that I did not think you had said before. You know, you have always said you cannot talk about decided cases because people might think there is some bias, but you introduced an argument I have heard you make to me privately, but I don’t know if you made it here publicly, which is you don’t want to try and, quote, get my vote by changing your position, and there shouldn’t be a bartering process at these hearings. I would like to say to you that I don’t think there should be either, and I don’t think anyone does. I am not asking you, I don’t think any member of this Committee, from Mr. Coburn all the way to the other end, is asking you to try and tailor your answers to what you think we want to hear. That would be unfair to you and unfair to us. All we are asking is to learn of your views within the ways you feel that you can tell us your views. So I think this argument that this is a bargaining or bartering process demeans it. I want to

know what you think, not what you think I want you to think, so I can make a fair judgment as to how to vote for you. And I think that is probably true of every single member here.
And, by the way, since you are before all of us, if you try to earn one person’s vote, you might lose another person’s vote. So you may as well just say what you think and not try to do any bartering. And I am sure that is how you think, too, but I don’t think that is a fair argument in terms of why people won’t answer questions about decided cases or about anything else. That would apply to every question you are asked that you might—we may as well not have hearings if the only reason was for you to try and twist yourself in a pretzel to please everybody here.
As I have said, I would like to vote for you. To me, as I said in my opening statement, the test is: Are you a mainstream person, conservative mainstream but mainstream, or an ideologue? Now, this is my view, and I am not going to ask you yours. I think there are a couple of ideologues, too, on the Court who want to use the law to change America dramatically in their vision. And so I am going to try a few other ways to try and figure out who you are so I feel comfortable with it.
Justice Rehnquist in his hearings to become Chief Justice 19 years ago was asked where he sat on the ideological spectrum of the Court. Justice Rehnquist replied, ‘‘On the conservative side. In fact, on the basis of the Court’s opinions,’’ he said, not their personal preferences—he had been on the Court I guess, 16 years? You would know better than me. But a good number of years—13, I think.
Judge ROBERTS. Thirteen. Senator SCHUMER. Yes. He said, ‘‘I think the Chief’’—Warren Burger—‘‘and I are probably the most conservative, and it may be that I am more so than he.’’ That doesn’t involve any previous case or bias. So let me ask you the parallel question about the D.C. Circuit upon which you sit now. Where, Judge, do you place yourself on the ideological spectrum of the D.C. Circuit? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I think that’s a very hard question to answer for a number of reasons. One, as you know, almost all of our opinions are unanimous. We don’t parse ourselves out according to an ideological spectrum. Senator SCHUMER. Most are technical—yes, many are tech or commercial, you know, governmental, technical. But on the tough ones they are not. Judge ROBERTS. I don’t know where I fall. I do know that I saw recently a study that was done that indicated I agree more with some judges appointed by Democratic Presidents than I do with judges appointed by other Republicans Presidents, and it’s not simply lined up according to the President who appointed you. There are judges there that I’ve joined in opinions where I’ve found myself—where we have had dissents. There are some—I know one case we were talking about earlier, the Bombardier case, Judge Rogers and I were in one position, Judge Rogers appointed by President Clinton, and Judge Garland was in a different position. I know in another case that was decided that we have talked about, Barber, Judge Garland and I were on one side and Judge Sentelle dissented.

408
So to the extent there have been divisions, I think you could go and see and they would be completely non—
Senator SCHUMER. So you are saying you are somewhere in the middle—
Judge ROBERTS.—political. I am saying that judges don’t think of themselves along an ideological spectrum.
Senator SCHUMER. Justice Rehnquist did. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t. Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Judge ROBERTS. And the judges, I think, on the D.C. Circuit generally don’t either. Senator SCHUMER. So I guess you wouldn’t want to place yourself on the current Supreme Court either. Judge ROBERTS. No, I think that would be— Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Let’s try another route. I didn’t think that one would get too far, although as I said, Justice Rehnquist did answer it. He is your mentor, and he answered it openly, fully, directly. He and Burger were the two most conservative, and he is more conservative than Burger. How about modesty and stability? Let’s try to talk about that. And when we met, I was very impressed with the concepts of modesty and stability. They suggest to me you respect precedent and well-settled law. You have said that yourself here, particularly in reference to Senator Specter’s opening round of questions. And that is a good opportunity for common ground. I had a history professor, Franklin Ford. He had Ford’s rule of history: ‘‘We are no smarter than our fathers.’’ A pretty good rule. And that is sort of a modest concept in history, not in jurisprudence. So I would like to find out a little bit more about modesty. So I would ask you—and these can be well settled, they could be 50 or 100 years ago, and please don’t go on at length—can you give me a few Supreme Court cases that are modest, or represent modesty, is a better way to put it, at least in your view, and a few Supreme Court cases that would represent immodesty? Judge ROBERTS. Sure. I guess I would think the clearest juxtaposition would be the cases from the Lochner era. If you take Lochner on the one hand and, say, West Coast Hotel, which kind of overruled and buried the Lochner approach on the other, and the immodesty that I see in the Lochner opinion is in its re-weighing of the legislative determination. You read that opinion, it’s about limits on how long bakers can work. And they’re saying we don’t think there’s any problem with bakers working more than 13 hours. Senator SCHUMER. Right. Judge ROBERTS. Well, the legislature thought there was, and they passed a law about it, and the issue should not have been, Judges, do you think this was a good law or do you think bakers should work longer or not? It should be: Is there anything in the Constitution that prohibits the legislature from doing that? Senator SCHUMER. How about another one? Judge ROBERTS. Well— Senator SCHUMER. Or modest ones. You know, it could be either way.

409
Judge ROBERTS. You know, people talk about Brown v. Board of Education, and let me explain why I think that is an example. It’s obviously a dramatic departure in American history, and in many respects very bold. Yet I think it’s more appropriately understood as a restrained decision compared to the decision that came before in Plessy v. Ferguson. And you can see this if you look at the arguments of the lawyers, because what John W. Davis was arguing on the side of the Board was to the Court, ‘‘You need to be worried about the social consequences of upsetting this decision. People have lived their lives this way. If you overturn this, it is going to be disruptive, the consequences are going to be bad.’’
Thurgood Marshall, on the other side, was making a legal argument addressed to the obligation of the Court to apply the rule of law, and he said, focused on the discrimination involved in the separation. He made an argument, and it was a very clever approach to the case because he based his decision on precedent as well, saying ‘‘You have had this recent case in Sweatt v. Painter. Don’t talk to me about Plessy v. Ferguson. You are beginning the process of departing from that. Your recent decision here, if you are going to be consistent, you have to come out this way.’’
So again it seems odd I know to talk about things like modesty in such a bold decision, but it is in my view a more appropriate judicial restrained decision.
Senator SCHUMER. Let me ask you. This is a general question that I was going to ask you that leads to this. In other words, if a decision of the Court issued many years ago is immodest, in your view, modesty could compel overruling?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think if you take— Senator SCHUMER. That is what you argued just a minute ago with Brown I think. Judge ROBERTS. Well, sometimes the appropriate restrained approach—now, with Brown my point was the notion of precedent was one that Thurgood Marshall appreciated in arguing to the Court that it shouldn’t be simply a debate. He didn’t want to debate it on John W. Davis’s terms about Plessy, should it be overruled or not? He said, ‘‘Here’s another precedent of the Court.’’ So he was arguing from precedent as well. Senator SCHUMER. Right. But when you have the conflict, a past error decision that was fundamentally immodest, let us say, and then years and years of it being on the books, stability argues keep it on the books, and even modesty, with its respect for precedent argues keep it on the books. How do you draw that? Can you just elaborate a little bit on how you weigh those two different concepts of ‘‘modesty?’’ Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think a modest approach requires beginning with the body of precedent. That is what judges do, and that’s a recognition just as Professor Ford said, that we’re not necessarily, we’re not smarter than our fathers who laid down this precedent. Senator SCHUMER. Professor Ford. Judge ROBERTS. Professor Ford, yes. My point with respect to Brown was that Thurgood Marshall appreciated that and then he was making an argument from precedent, just as the way Davis was, and they kind of I think gave the Court some comfort in de-

410
parting from Plessy, that they had already taken the initial step in Sweatt v. Painter.
Senator SCHUMER. Let me go to—I think Senator Durbin alluded to it, because this is one that was a little troubling and maybe you can talk about it. In the memo you wrote about Wallace v. Jaffre which had just been decided, involved church and state—I am not interested right now in the specific holding—you wrote, ‘‘Rehnquist tried to revolutionize Establishment Clause jurisprudence and ended up losing the majority, which is not to say the effort was misguided.’’ Then you wrote, because you were speaking approvingly of Rehnquist’s attempt to revolutionize a well-settled area of law. You also in the same memo criticize the opinion of Lewis Powell, same case, criticizing as, ‘‘a lame concurring opinion focusing on stare decisis.’’
To at least the reader of this it seems very immodest, praising the revolutionary decision and sort of criticizing, saying it was lame opinion for focusing on stare decisis.
I know you wrote this 20 years ago, and I know you wrote it for your boss, Ronald Reagan, who you admire—I admire him too but probably for different reasons—but those words, Ronald Reagan did not command you to say, ‘‘I approve of Rehnquist’s view to revolutionize [Powell].’’ I know your establishment clause jurisprudence had to come out on that side. Just please explain to me, if you still stand by, not the holdings in the case, not whether Wallace v. Jaffre was correctly decided, but the language that you used, the thinking that you used, how does that square with modesty, or had you not developed the theory of modesty when you were there as a young clerk or a young member of the, I guess at that point, Solicitor General’s Office.
Judge ROBERTS. No, no. Senator SCHUMER. Wherever you were. Judge ROBERTS. If it’s 20 years ago it would have been— Senator SCHUMER. It is 1985, yes. Judge ROBERTS. It would have been in the White House Counsel’s Office. Senator SCHUMER. White House Counsel’s Office. Excuse me. Judge ROBERTS. And the memo that you are referring to is, obviously, it’s speculation about what happened in the case. Senator SCHUMER. I know. How does it square with modesty? Did modesty arise in your way of thinking after that? Judge ROBERTS. It’s not a question about me being a judge. It’s a question about my describing what I was obviously speculating was going on in that particular case. Senator SCHUMER. But you approved of it. You said the revolutionary aspects were not—‘‘which is not to say the effort was misguided.’’ And then you said ‘‘lame’’—there is no real way to interpret that except pejoratively—‘‘concurring opinion that focused on stare decisis.’’ Judge ROBERTS. Saying that the effort was not misguided referred to what I had been speculating was the Chief Justice’s effort to reformulate the approach in that case, and it’s the Lemon test, and we’ve talked about the Lemon test before, and the pluses and minuses. I’ve described it I think it was today, maybe yesterday. It is a survivor. I noted when we argued the Lee v. Weisman case,

411
that every—six of the Justices I think had taken the position critical of the Lemon test, six of the sitting Justices. They never took it at the same time. It is still the test that applies, and it would be, the precedent that I would begin with—
Senator SCHUMER. Just going to cut you off. I apologize, because I have 16 seconds, and the Chairman said I have to ask the questions before.
Just assure me and maybe some more of us, that modesty is not a concept that you use when you want to slow things down because the courts are moving too fast, but you do not use when you think things should be sped up, that it is a general approach that sort of says to judiciary, ‘‘Go slow in every aspect.’’ Try to convince me of that if you can.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I’ll try, Senator. It is a neutral principle. Your suggestion that I apply it in cases where I want to but don’t— is of course a grievous insult to any judge, the notion that they’re result-oriented, that they would apply a particular approach one way in one sort of cases and a different way in another case. That’s not how I approach judging and not how I would approach judging whether I’m back on the court of appeals or somewhere else.
It is a neutral principle. It reflects the—and it’s obviously not an original concept with me.
Senator SCHUMER. No, it’s not. Judge ROBERTS. There are judges, you go back throughout our history, that have articulated and recognized the principle of judicial restraint, that there are limits on what the judge can do. And those judges have always explained that this applies whether or not I’m in favor of a particular result or not. It’s a reflection of their institutional authority in their role, that their job is to interpret the law, not to make the law. And that applies without regard to what law you would like to have made or not. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Schumer. Thank you, Judge Roberts. Thank you all. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. We will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. That concludes our hearing.

NOMINATION OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR., OF MARYLAND, TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2005
UNITED STATES SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:01 a.m., in room SH–216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman SPECTER. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning, Judge Roberts. Judge ROBERTS. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. We will now proceed to the third round of questioning, which will be abbreviated. There are six Senators on the other side of the aisle who have requested additional time. There will not be a third round for any of the Senators on the other side of the aisle. We will go into a closed session a little before 11:00, and we will turn to the outside witnesses hopefully at 11:30. And we project a conclusion late this afternoon, but that will depend upon the sequence of events. I now yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy, for 20 minutes. Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, you are really going to miss us, aren’t you? You are going to miss doing this every day. It is—you are not even going to answer that one, are you? [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Senator. Senator LEAHY. When we left off the other day, you and I were discussing the Supreme Court’s decision in the Christine Franklin Title IX case. This, for those who may have forgotten, is the case of very, very serious sexual abuse of a young girl by her teacher. It makes your skin crawl just to hear the facts of it. Now, Justice White’s opinion for the Supreme Court rejected your arguments, your technical legal arguments. You had argued she should not be allowed to sue for damages. He wrote, ‘‘From the earliest years of the Republic, the Court has recognized the power
(413)

414
of the judiciary to award appropriate remedies to redress injuries actionable in Federal court.’’ He went on to note that, ‘‘To disallow a damages remedy in this case would be to abdicate our historic judicial authority to award appropriate relief in cases brought in our court system.’’
And then, most tellingly, Justice White wrote that your argument that Christine Franklin’s remedy should be limited to back pay and injunction, a position you had reiterated a couple days ago, he said that conflicts with sound logic. He went on to say it is clearly inadequate. And he wrote that back pay does nothing for her and that prospective relief accords her no remedies at all.
Now, the reason I raise this case is not that it is one of those rare ones where you were on the losing side, but I raise it because I felt it was a case about what our courts should do, including doing justice and remedying rights and protecting Americans.
So my question to you is this: Do you now recognize that the Supreme Court’s view in the case as set forth in Justice White’s opinion was the right one and the positions of the United States in your brief were the wrong ones?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, as a judge looking at it, obviously when you lose a case, as you point out, 9–0, it’s a pretty clear signal that the legal position you were advocating was the wrong one. The position the administration took in that case was the same position that the court of appeals had taken. In other words, what the Supreme Court did was reverse the lower court, so—
Senator LEAHY. Well, I— Judge ROBERTS. I’m just explaining why the position we took prior to the decision may have looked different than it did after the decision. Senator LEAHY. And I understand that. I thought I sort of laid that out earlier. But my question is: Do you now accept that Justice White’s position was right and that the Government’s position was wrong? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I certainly accept the decision of the Court, the 9–0 decision, as you say, as a binding precedent of the Court and, again, have no cause or agenda to revisit it or any quarrel with it. The issue, of course, was the one of what remedies are available for an implied cause of action. The reason I think that the lower courts came out the other way and the Supreme Court came out one way is that you’re dealing with an implied cause of action. In other words, it hasn’t been spelled out and— Senator LEAHY. But I think the Supreme Court was looking and acting, as they felt, within the law for an area that would actually bring justice. That was basically my point. It may have been implied, but they looked within the case, they looked within the law, and they found an area to bring justice. And I realize hard cases sometimes make not the best law, but I think this case is a hard case but it made good law. Would you agree? Judge ROBERTS. I have no quarrel with the Court’s decision, Senator. Senator LEAHY. You have been involved a great deal in the development of the Supreme Court authority limiting the ability of individual Americans to ensure they actually receive the rights and protections that Congress has mandated under Spending Clauses.

415
In the Reagan administration, you advocated legislative responses to Maine v. Thiboutot. That is how the Supreme Court tells me it is pronounced. It is not how those of us who live with those of French-Canadian descent might say it. But you strongly criticize— that was a case that recognized broad access to courts to vindicate your rights under Federal law. You criticized the damage supposedly caused by that case in a 1982 memo. And then you wrote briefs and argued before the Supreme Court in the 1980’s and the 1990’s. We talked about some of these—South Dakota v. Dole, Wilder v. Virginia Hospital, Suter v. Artist M., Gonzaga University v. Doe. And you called for the narrowing of Congress’s spending powers and limiting the right of individuals to sue to compel the protections Congress required under Federal law.
I worry about this if an individual loses their right to sue if the State or the administration, whoever the administration might be, doesn’t protect their rights. For example, if the only remedy for a State’s refusal to live up to its obligations under a spending power enactment, like Medicaid or another such program, is action by the Federal Government, and the Federal Government doesn’t act, where does that leave the rule of law? Where does that leave America’s sense of justice if an individual can’t then step in and seek action?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, two points, Senator. The issue in the Spending Clause cases that you refer to—Wilder, the later one, the Suter case, and the Gonzaga case that I argued when I was in private practice—the issue is one of congressional intent. The question is: Did Congress intend there to be a private right of action? That’s what the courts are trying to figure out. And if Congress did intend there to be a private right of action, if Congress intended this to be actionable whether through 1983 or under—Section 1983 or under the law itself, then there would be a private right of action. In some cases, Congress doesn’t intend that, and in those cases, there wouldn’t be. I would say—
Senator LEAHY. But—no, go ahead. Judge ROBERTS. I was just going to make the point that in those cases, of course, I was advocating a position for a client. I did have occasion as a judge to address a Spending Clause case. It was a case called Barber v. Washington Metropolitan Area— Senator LEAHY. But that one, the statute was pretty darn clear, the Metro case. Judge ROBERTS. Well, it was a 2–1 decision, divided decision on a court that doesn’t often issue 2–1 decisions. There was a lengthy dissent saying that Congress did not have the authority to require the Metro— Senator LEAHY. Judge Sentelle dissented? Judge ROBERTS. Judge Sentelle dissented. Senator LEAHY. I read that. I don’t want to go into that. He is not here before us. But what I worry about, though, is the trend of these to say that Congress intended these programs, more like Medicaid, commitments there to be kind of an exclusive bargain between the Federal Government and the State government. And that raises a question in my mind. Do the courts really think we have made empty promises? I thought of this the other night because I remember what you said about the empty promises of the

Soviet Constitution. But wouldn’t it be an indication we were making the same kind of empty promises if individuals can’t sue if they are left as innocent bystanders who are harmed, but they have no remedy if the State is negligent in acting or if the Federal Government doesn’t protect it? I mean, why shouldn’t they be able to sue to get the promises that are made in these bills so that it is not like the Soviet constitution, great promises but empty?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the issue is not whether they should be able to sue or not. The issue is whether Congress intended them to be able to sue or not. The issue doesn’t even come up if Congress would simply spell out in the legislation we intended these individuals to have the right to sue in Federal court. That would prevent the issue from even coming up.
All of those cases we have been talking about arose because Congress did not address the question, and, therefore, the courts—
Senator LEAHY. Yes, but Congress assumes the States and the Federal Government are going to do what the law spells out. We don’t do it as an empty promise. We assume they are going to do it. When they don’t do it, if you are developmentally disabled, Medicaid kids, foster kids, rape victims and so on, shouldn’t they be able to have a voice?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, if Congress wants them to sue, all Congress has to do is write one sentence saying, ‘‘Individuals harmed by a violation of this statute may bring a right of action in Federal court.’’ There are laws where Congress says that, and that question never comes up.
The issue in the various cases that we have been talking about, including in the Barber case, where I ruled that the individual did have the right to sue when I was judge, the issue is, What did Congress intend? And all too often that issue is not even addressed. I don’t know whether it’s because of inadvertence or it’s because of an inability of Congress to agree, and they both sort of—both sides sort of say, well, let’s let the courts figure it out.
Senator LEAHY. Well, maybe it is an assumption of those of us who take an oath of office here to uphold the laws that the State government, those officials who take similar oaths of office, or the administrators in the national government who take similar oaths of office are actually going to do what they have sworn to do.
Judge ROBERTS. Well— Senator LEAHY. Let me—can I move on? Because it also goes to— and I understand your point on this, and we could probably debate this all morning long. But I hope you understand my concern, which is a concern of lot of American people in this area. Let’s go to another precedent that moved me a great deal, Gideon v. Wainwright. As a young law student, I had an opportunity—my wife and I had an opportunity to have lunch with Hugo Black shortly after that, one of the most memorable times I had. He was a former Senator. He recognized the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee to counsel in a criminal case was a fundamental right to a fair trial. He called it an obvious truth that in an adversary system of criminal justice, any person hauled into court who was too poor to hire a lawyer cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. There is a wonderful book, ‘‘Gideon’s Trumpet,’’ that Anthony Lewis wrote.

Doesn’t Gideon stand for the principle that to be meaningful such a fundamental right as the right to counsel requires assurances that can be exercised?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes, I think so. I have often said that a lot of these difficulties, particularly in the area of legal errors being raised and collateral review, a lot of those difficult questions could be avoided if people had competent counsel from the very beginning.
Senator LEAHY. Well, doesn’t the same principle embodied in Gideon, that the Constitution guarantees a person’s ability to exercise fundamental constitutional rights, doesn’t that apply to other constitutional rights? I mean, to be meaningful, if we have these rights, they have also got to be real in people’s lives.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think the basic instinct and genius behind the Gideon decision was that without counsel to protect people’s rights, they were going to forfeit them. They were going to waive them due to ignorance or inability to appreciate the proceedings, and that is why you need counsel at that stage. It is not simply because you have a right to counsel in the abstract. It was the recognition that having counsel is a way to ensure the protection of your other rights that you may not even be aware of.
Senator LEAHY. That could be with a lot of our rights. I mean we have got to be meaningful. You cannot just say you have them. I am really struck by your discussion of the Soviet Constitution. I totally agree with you on that, but we have 280 million Americans of all different economic and educational backgrounds and everything else; we have wonderful rights. Our Bill of Rights is, I think, one of the most amazing things ever written by a democratic people. But the rights are only there if they are meaningful in people’s lives, if they can be enforced. And ultimately it may come right down to the courts.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I think— Senator LEAHY. I mean Hugo Black’s opinion is a pretty strong opinion. You suggested I may have over-read your memo following the Lebanon operation. You said it was really talking about veterans’ rights, but actually your memo, what struck me, it does not say veterans’ rights, it says ‘‘War Powers’’ on it. The Constitution vests the power of declaring war in Congress, not the President. I still have a hard time squaring that with your inherent authority argument you advanced in that memo. Maybe I could ask it this way. Do you continue to believe that the President has inherent authority to invade a sovereign nation absent attack by a foreign power? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, that is a very abstract hypothetical. There are situations that arise when an Executive may determine that that type of action is necessary. That may be challenged. I don’t think abstract questions like that should be answered. There have been situations in our past where that authority has been claimed, both abstractly and concretely. Certainly Congress has the power to declare war, but as you know, of course, there have been several incidents in our history, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, others where there has been authorization of the use of force, but not a declaration of war.

You know the history, when Madison’s original proposal gave Congress the authority to make war, and he thought that should be changed so that the Executive would have the authority to respond to an invasion, and I appreciate that part of your question.
Senator LEAHY. You also have George Washington, if you are going to quote people back at that time. George Washington ‘‘no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after Congress shall have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure.’’ So I will go to the flip side, can Congress stop a war?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that’s of course a difficult question. Now, Congress has always exercised the power of the purse with respect to activities of that sort, and regulated the funding for that type of activity, and that has of course always been the core of Congress’s authority. But the question to actually terminate hostilities that the Executive has determined to initiate, either with the authorization of Congress on in the situation of congressional silence or acquiescence, to go back to the Youngstown decision. The issue of what Congress’s authorities are to terminate short of exercising its power with respect to the purse, those are unsettled and I think have to be addressed in the context of a particular case.
The memo to which you refer, again, I was a lawyer for the Executive, and any cautious lawyer for the Executive, without regard to the administration, would be alert for any type of suggestion that there are limits on that power, just as—
Senator LEAHY. Showing how cautious you were, you wrote, in another memo regarding the invasion of Grenada, ‘‘There’s no clear line separating what the President may do on his own and what requires a formal declaration of war,’’ but you conclude the exercise of Presidential power in connection with the Grenada incident fell comfortably on the legitimate side of the line. What is a situation that falls on the illegitimate side of the line where a declaration of war would be needed?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, you know, you take the history anyway, if you have a situation like the Korean War taking place without a declaration of war, the war in Vietnam taking place without a declaration of war, I think it’s difficult to articulate in the abstract where the line would be other than the fact that throughout our history there have been those significant types of engagements that I suspect all of the people involved in them thought were a war that did not have a congressional declaration of war. So again, where the line is drawn or how it would be drawn in a particular case, or even what the role of the courts would be. As you know in these areas there’s often an initial dispute, is this a judiciable question that the Court should entertain in the case of litigation and a conflict between the executive and the legislative concerning something like whether a declaration of war was required. That would be a question the Court would have to address before reaching the merits.
Senator LEAHY. Let me switch gears again. Senator Grassley, who is not here right now, and Senator Specter and I have worked for several years to shed some light on the FISA Court, the Foreign Intelligence Court. A lot of Americans are affected by the decisions. Most Americans do not know how it works, do not know whether civil liberties are being curtailed or violated. We added some sun-

shine provisions. The Attorney General now submits a biannual report to four congressional committees, details how many people are targeted for electronic surveillance and so on. It still is inadequate in that it doesn’t get public reporting. If you are confirmed as Chief Justice, you are the overseer of the FISA Court. Most do not even look at that role of the Chief Justice. I think it is probably one of the most important ones if you are going to talk about our liberties and how they are protected. Would you be willing to work with Members of Congress to add more transparency, or do you believe there is enough transparency in the work of the FISA Court now?
Judge ROBERTS. Senator, you said you think this is something most Americans aren’t aware of. I’d suggest probably most judges aren’t aware of it. It is a specialized court. I will tell you when I became aware of it, it’s a surprising institution. It’s an unusual setup.
Senator LEAHY. Certainly different than what we think in our system of courts.
Judge ROBERTS. That was exactly my reaction. On the other hand, Congress, in setting up the court, obviously concluded there were reasons to do it that way. I was asked a question about appointing the judges to it, and my response was that given the unusual nature of it, very unusual nature, given the usual traditions of judicial processes, that the people appointed to it have to be people of the highest quality, undoubted commitment to all the basic principles, both of the need for the court and the need to protect civil liberties. That, I think, is very important.
Beyond that I would just tell you I don’t know enough about the operations of the court at this point and how it functions to be able to make any representations about what I would do other than that I certainly appreciate that it’s an unusual establishment and in many respects doesn’t have the sorts of protections that the normal judicial process has, and that I would be sensitive to those concerns.
Senator LEAHY. I realize my time is up and I apologize, but I hope that if you are confirmed that you might be willing—and I think Senators Grassley, Specter and myself could put together some suggestions—to at least keep an open mind on.
Judge ROBERTS. Certainly, Senator. Senator LEAHY. Because in an electronic age, in a digital age, when more and more information is being pulled in on Americans that we sometimes do not even know about, it is frightening. We want security, but we want to keep in mind—as Benjamin Franklin said, that people who give up their liberties for security deserve neither. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Kennedy for 20 minutes. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Judge Roberts. Judge ROBERTS. Good morning, Senator.

Senator KENNEDY. In response to a question that was asked by Senator Biden the other day, you appropriately pointed out that there were different responsibilities at the local level, State level and national level in dealing with the challenges our country faces in domestic policy. I want to talk about what you understand are the powers that we have at the national level.
And I want to start off with the issue of racial discrimination, discrimination on the basis of race in our society. We have talked about this in different ways over the past few days, and our Founding Fathers did not get it right in the Constitution. We have had the Civil War and the struggles of Dr. King. Do you believe that we have the authority and the power to pass legislation to free ourselves from the stains of racial discrimination?
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. Now let me ask you about gender discrimination. We find out over the history of this country, as you are very familiar, how women have been discriminated against in all forms and all shapes, and now I want to ask you whether you believe that we have the power and the authority to pass legislation to free our Nation from discrimination against women in our society? Judge ROBERTS. Yes, Senator, I do. I’m familiar with the various legislative enactments in the area that protect the right to work and so forth, free from discrimination. Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask you about those that are faced with disabilities. Do you think the 50 million Americans that are faced with disabilities in one form or another, challenges I like to say, do you think that we have the authority and the power to free this country, free our Nation from the forms of discrimination against those who have disability? Judge ROBERTS. I do, Senator. Now, there are issues that come up, as you know, in several of the cases before the Supreme Court on the particular applications of that, cases concerning the question of do you have the authority under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to abrogate State sovereign immunity if the claim of disability discrimination concerns a State as a defendant. And as you know, in the Garrett case there was the conclusion that the authority was not there. Later in the Lane case under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the conclusion was that the sufficient record had been established that there was the authority. So while as a general matter, there is the authority in a particular case that may come up against other provisions in the Constitution, or—in that case the recognition of State sovereign immunity, and that presents an issue that the courts have to address. Senator KENNEDY. You mentioned the Lane case. That was decided 5–4, 5–4. We are going to hear later today from Beverly Jones, who was a plaintiff in that case. I have listened to her and met with her before. She is an extraordinary woman, mother of two, trying to provide for her family, and a court reporter. The issue or question whether she was going to crawl up the flight of stairs to have access to the courtroom and have someone bring up her wheelchair, or whether she was effectively going to be denied that opportunity to have access to a courtroom in Tennessee. Four Justices indicated in their dissent that this kind of an issue or question ought to be resolved by the States, effectively, 50 States

421
ought to be making that judgment. I strongly believe that this country, in its march towards progress in dealing with disabilities, with Americans with Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act, the work that was done with IDEA over a long period of time, that we have come to the point where we as a country want to invite all of those with forms of disability to be a part of the main stream. But that was a 5–4 decision.
And I appreciate the fact you at least mention Lane v. Tennessee, that you are at least sympathetic to the judgment that Justice O’Connor made in indicating that accommodation for those with disability in that case was appropriate.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, it’s certainly the precedent of the Court in that area and I have no quarrel with it. The issue of course is whether or not Congress has the authority under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to abrogate the State’s sovereign immunity. It’s not a policy judgment by the Court about leaving things to the States or the Federal Government, but a legal determination of whether the State’s sovereign immunity has been abrogated. And the Court determined in that case that Congress did have that authority and that it could authorize the suit against the State institution.
Senator KENNEDY. We are going to come back to the kind of legalist determinations that make an extraordinary difference in terms of people’s lives. We welcome guidance and invitation about which particular provisions of the Constitution that we ought to utilize in order to strike down these forms of discrimination.
Let me ask you a broader question. Do you think having a diverse society where everyone has an equal chance to participate is an American value and is fundamental to the strength of our society?
Judge ROBERTS. I do, I agree with that statement Senator, yes. Senator KENNEDY. I do too, and I want to just review very quickly what I consider to be sort of a pattern in different judgments that you have made over a period of 20 years. We have not got a lot of time and I am not going to bother going through the memoranda unless you would like to. But for someone who is a minority, a woman, disabled, and looks at a pattern over 20 years where you were actively involved in the Reagan administration against affirmative action—I am leaving out the whole issue of quotas, all of us oppose quotas, we are talking about affirmative action—and you expressed strong reservations about the affirmation action. Then in 1991 in the FCC case, you as the advocate for the U.S., the Acting Solicitor General, refused to take the position of the FCC, your own client. And the FCC filed briefs in favor of its own affirmative action program and your office opposed the FCC. This is, as I understand, extremely unusual. Part of the difficulty that we have, Judge Roberts, is we do not have your records on affirmative action. They were in the Reagan Library and at some time they became misplaced and we do not have those records to be able to give a complete review of these documents, although what I am stating here is factual. We do not have the information that we requested from the Solicitor General’s Office, who, as you appropriately mentioned yesterday, is America’s lawyer.

422
In this particular case, the FCC—with its affirmative action program that recognized that with all of the broadcasting and the television stations there were very few minority-owned stations and they had a very modest program—petitioned you to intervene on behalf of the FCC. But you made a judgment that you would enter a brief in opposition to it. The Supreme Court came out in favor of the FCC. I know that the standard altered and changed subsequently on that case.
And then in 2001 you took a private case to basically ensure that the Department of Transportation’s affirmative action program that applied in this case to the highways, which has been overwhelmingly supported by the Congress year in and year out, would be effectively undermined.
The point I am asking here is, given these series of actions over a period of time, what do you think in your record would give some sense of hope to women, to minorities, to those that are disabled that are not looking for a hand-out, but just looking for a chance in this diverse society to be able to have an equal opportunity?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, I think there’s a great deal in my background that you could look to in that respect. For example, you could look to the cases in which I argued in favor of affirmative action. I’ve argued on both sides of that issue. In the Rice v. Cayetano case, for example, before the Supreme Court, I argued in favor of affirmative action for Native Hawaiians. I lost that case but I was arguing on the side of affirmative action.
There are other episodes in my background that people could look to. For example, I regularly participate in, when I was at my law firm, a program sponsored by the firm, a legal reasoning program for minority and disadvantaged students going on to law school, to help them prepare for the rigors of law school, so not simply that they would be chosen, selected and admitted into law school, but be in a better position to be able to succeed once they got there.
With respect to the FCC case that you mentioned in the Metro Broadcasting case, I think a fuller understanding of the situation there is necessary. The United States had already taken a position before the FCC opposed to the FCC program. That put the Solicitor General’s Office in the position where they had—the position of the United States, which was opposed to it, and the FCC position which had prevailed before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. I authorized the FCC to defend its position in court. That was a discretionary decision. I didn’t have to do that, but I thought the Supreme Court, in a situation where the FCC, part of the United States and the formal position of the United States, before I had ever gotten involved in the case, were at loggerheads, that the Court should have both views and decide the case. They did decide it in favor of the FCC 5–4, and as you noted in the other case that I participated in later, the Supreme Court overturned that decision.
The long and short of it is, that if you look at my record on the question of affirmative action, yes, I was in an administration that was opposed to quotas. Opposition to quotas is not the same thing as opposition to affirmative action. That was something that President Reagan emphasized repeatedly. I argued against quotas in the

423
FCC case. I argued in favor of affirmative action in the Hawaiian case. In terms of my own personal involvement, I’ve been active in programs that promote the interests of minorities and disadvantaged to participate fully in our society.
Senator KENNEDY. As you know, the Hawaiian case was not an affirmative action case. You gave that response to Senator Durbin in the written answers when you were promoted to the circuit court. The case itself indicates that it was not an affirmative action case. All right. Well, let me go—we will agree to differ.
Judge ROBERTS. Sure. Senator KENNEDY. I have just a short time left. On the EEOC, there is the quote that you have. This is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that was set up in 1964 as part of the 1964 Act. And it was basically set up at the strong suggestion and recommendation of Everett Dirksen, who played a key role in trying to deal with the discrimination of women, of race, of ethnicity, and national origin. And so they set up a Commission in order to be able to take the various complaints. They did not think they would have many complaints. The first year they had 9,000 complaints, and it has been doing extraordinary work ever since. You mentioned in your memorandum that we should—you are familiar I think with these words; they have been written up in the journals and you can probably recognize them. ‘‘We should ignore the assertion that the EEOC is un-American, the truth of the matter notwithstanding.’’ Is there some reason that you would make a comment like that, ‘‘the truth of the matter’’ ? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, you have to read the memo I think in its entirety to put it in context. That was not my language. That was the language—the ‘‘un-American’’ reference was the language that was employed by an individual who had a case before the EEOC. He actually won his case before the EEOC, but he didn’t like the difficulty and the time involved. He wrote to the President, and he said two things, one, that his treatment at the hands of the EEOC was un-American, and two, that the President has promised in the campaign to abolish the EEOC, and he wanted to hold the President to that promise. It was my responsibility to figure out how to respond to this complaint that had been received. And how we responded was by protecting that EEOC from interference by the President in any political way, by protecting the EEOC from this sort of complaint. We did not go to the President and say, ‘‘You’ve got to do something about the EEOC.’’ We didn’t pass on the objection at all. And the point of the letter, when you read the whole memorandum, you see two points. The first is that I was unable to determine, in the short time I had to respond, whether or not the President had made such a pledge to abolish to EEOC. I simply didn’t know, and I said that in the paragraph if you read it. And that’s what ‘‘the truth of the matter notwithstanding’’ is referring to, the question of whether or not the President had promised to abolish the EEOC. I say right in the memo that we cannot determine that, and whether his treatment was unAmerican or not is beside the point. We don’t interfere with the ac-

tivities of the EEOC. That was the conclusion and that’s what we did in that case.
Senator KENNEDY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that the memo by included in the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be included. Senator KENNEDY. You say that the assertion that the EEOC is un-American—the ‘‘truth of the matter notwithstanding’’ was your comment though. Judge ROBERTS. You do need to read the prior clause, prior sentence. Senator KENNEDY. I have read it a number of times and I will include it in the record and we will let the record stand. Chairman SPECTER. When Senator Kennedy’s line of questioning is finished and he has used his time, he will have the memo and you can respond. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you. Senator KENNEDY. At the outset of my questions I talked about Earl Warren, and you were enormously complimentary about Earl Warren, about him understanding not only the law, but also understanding the importance of the Chief Justice bringing other Justices together in a very important way in terms of dealing with a societal issue and a question. And I think we are a fairer country and a fairer land because of this. This was really the bringing together of the mind and the heart. Oliver Wendell Holmes said: It’s dangerous to think that legal issues can be worked out like mathematics. And another nominee who was here not too long ago, had this to say about the head and the heart. ‘‘What you worry about is someone trying to decide an individual case without thinking out the effect of that decision on a lot of cases. That is why I always think law requires both a heart and a head. If you do not have a heart, it becomes a sterile set of rules, removed from human problems and it will not help. If you do not have a head, there is the risk that in trying to decide a particular person’s problem in a case, that may look fine for that person, but you cause trouble for a lot of other people, making their lives yet worse.’’ In the remaining moment, recalling Justice Warren, just thinking through what other nominees have said about the importance of a heart and a legal mind, and you as a Chief Justice together, in telling the American people how you were inspired by Chief Justice Warren at a very important and critical time in our Nation’s history, what could you tell them now that could give them the assurance that you might be a similar kind of Chief Justice should you be approved by the Senate? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, my point with respect to Chief Justice Warren was that he appreciated the impact that the decision in Brown would have, and he appreciated that the impact would be far more beneficial and favorable and far more effectively implemented with the unanimous Court, the Court speaking with one voice, than a splintered Court. The issue was significant enough that he spent the extra time in the reargument of the case to devote his energies to convincing the other Justices—and obviously, there’s no arm-twisting or any of that. It’s the type of collegial discussion that judges and justices have to engage in of the im-

425
portance of what the Court was doing, and an appreciation of its impact on real people and real lives.
I recognize as a judge, and I recognized as a lawyer, that these cases have impact on real people and real lives. I always insisted when I was a lawyer about getting out into the field and seeing it. If I was arguing a case involving Native villages in Alaska, I went to the villages. If I was arguing a case about an assembly line, I went to the assembly line. You had to see where the case was going to have its impact and what its impression was going to be on people.
Now, none of those cases were as important as Brown v. Board of Education, but the basic principle is the same. I think judges do have to appreciate that they’re dealing with real people with real cases. We obviously deal with documents and texts, the Constitution, the statutes, the legislative history, and that is where the legal decisions are made, but judges never lose sight, or should never lose sight of the fact that their decisions affect real people with real lives, and I appreciate that.
Senator KENNEDY. My time is up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. As I said when Senator Kennedy was questioning you about the EEOC, I did not want to take his time to have him present the memo to you, the limited time that he had, and it has been made a part of the record. Senator Kennedy, if you would make the memo available now to—Senator Kennedy, if I could have your attention? Senator KENNEDY. Yes, excuse me. Chairman SPECTER. If you would make the memo available to Judge Roberts now so that he can comment on it now without having taken your time to do that. Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. As you know, this has been redacted, and so I think in fairness to him and in fairness to the Committee, if we can get out the other redactions, it would be a more accurate and complete record. Chairman SPECTER. Well, if it is possible for Judge Roberts to deal with the redactions, that would be fine. Judge ROBERTS. I think the redactions simply identify the individual—the individual who was making the complaint, who had his case. The only thing I would emphasize is that the language that was quoted was part of a sentence, and the question of what ‘‘the truth of the matter’’ is referring to goes to the first part of the sentence that was not read, which is the assertion, the assertion that the President promised to abolish the EEOC. That was the matter that I could not determine in the time available whether that was correct or not, so I said, ‘‘The truth of that matter notwithstanding.’’ And I also emphasized that any reference to the phrase ‘‘un-American’’ is always in quotes to make it clear that that’s what the writer of the letter said, and certainly not what I said, and was certainly not my view then or now. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kennedy, do you want to follow up on that?

426
Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think we have been over this. After all is said and done, about finding out what President Reagan wanted to abolish or not abolish, that really wasn’t the issue or the question. And the question is about whether—the use of ‘‘un-American’’ is obviously unacceptable and they are dismissing that. But Judge Roberts said the assertion the EEOC is ‘‘un-American’’—and he is quite right saying that they were dismissing that word. But then he adds, ‘‘The truth of the matter notwithstanding.’’ I think it is not unreasonable to assume that he somehow was disparaging the EEOC. That is all. I am glad to let the record stand, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. Any counter-reply? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I am glad to let the record stand, just so long as the whole memorandum and the entire sentence that is being discussed is in the record. Chairman SPECTER. We have finally come to one point of agreement. Senator Feinstein for 15 minutes. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to just say one thing, Judge Roberts. I don’t really know what I am going to do with respect to voting for you or voting against you. I had one impression of you when we had our hour in private, and to a great extent, I think I came out of that meeting with a different sense of you. And, of course, the impression that I have today is of this very cautious, very precise man, young, obviously with staying power. I mean, you have gone through this in a remarkable way. I am convinced you will be there, God willing, for 40 years. And that concerns me even more because it means that my vote means that much more. And I come from a different side than my Republican colleagues do, with different concerns, I think, and different life experiences. Last night, I gave you the Plyler memo. Senator Durbin asked a number of questions. I asked a few. And you read that memo, I hope, last night. Judge ROBERTS. I did, Senator, yes. Senator FEINSTEIN. Do you believe you were wrong? Judge ROBERTS. Well, Senator, on the underlying question— Senator FEINSTEIN. Could you say you were wrong if you believed you were wrong? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I can say that the—the reason I’m hesitating—and this is what was brought out in the Congressional Research Service memo that you attached to it. These issues come up all the time in related questions. I have no quarrel with the Court’s decision. As you know, it was a 5–4 decision on the legal question, not the question—I certainly believe every child should be educated. Senator FEINSTEIN. Regardless of immigration status? Judge ROBERTS. My own view is that if you have a child, he or she should be educated, and you worry about status later. Senator FEINSTEIN. Just say yes, regardless of immigration status. Judge ROBERTS. As a personal view, yes. It’s a separate issue as a legal question, as you know. And the Court in Plyler split 5–4. Among the dissenters, the people who agreed with the position that

the administration—or the position discussed in the memorandum were Justice White and Justice O’Connor. And I would not take their subscribing to the position of the dissent in Plyler v. Doe as suggesting that they in any way have less than fully developed and sensitive concerns about children and education. Justices White and O’Connor don’t, and they’re not subject to criticism on that score simply because their understanding of the law came out in the dissent in Plyler v. Doe.
So I would just try to make sure that people appreciate that saying that this is what you think the legal determination was—because the issue there was the Texas Legislature, the representative of the people of Texas, had reached a certain determination about funding and how they wanted to fund particular activities. And that was what the litigation was about. It’s not a question about whether you believe in educating children or not. I don’t think Justice O’Connor didn’t believe that children should be educated, yet she was in the dissent in that case.
Senator FEINSTEIN. I understand. Let me just give you two human dynamics. One of the people in public life that I most respect is a mayor in my State of a small immigrant community called Orange Cove. His name is Victor Lopez. I have known him for about 10 years. I am a former mayor, and I have watched him try to build a town from nothing. I was there. There weren’t sidewalks. There weren’t schools. He has managed to do it. He has given his people—they are all agricultural workers—a sense of pride and dignity.
To me, that is the American dream. It is the Federal Government’s job to keep illegal immigrants out, but once they are here, it is our job to see that they have certain basic rights, I think, among them education.
Another interesting twist to this is in 1986, an amnesty was passed. Plyler was in 1982. If the decision had gone the other way, you could have seen the enormous problem that would have happened in 1986 when all these children, then legal absolutely, still would have been denied school. So I think that is an interesting twist.
Now, Duke Law School Professor Katherine Fisk examined nine cases heard by you while you have been on the court of appeals. Her review concluded that you ruled in favor of a business each time. Consequently, she made this prediction: you’re going to be a fairly reliable vote against workers’ rights across the board.
Would you respond to that, please? Judge ROBERTS. I think the conclusion is wrong. I would suggest that any examination of nine cases is too small of a statistical sample to draw any conclusions of that sort. I know that I’ve ruled against corporations on a regular basis on the D.C. Circuit. I think I just saw a study, a more comprehensive one, that suggested I tended to rule against corporations more than the average judge. I don’t want to—I just skimmed the article, but it is quite often the case, for example, a lot of the business on the D.C. Circuit involves regulatory issues, agencies regulating corporations. Are you ruling in favor of the corporation or the agency? And I know I regularly rule in favor of the agency. Sometimes I rule against the agency. I like to think it depends upon the particular law and the par-

428
ticular facts. But I haven’t seen that study, but, again, nine cases, I am sure you could fine nine cases going the other way as well.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. I want to move on. A number of people on our side are very concerned about Executive power and what we perceive, either rightly or wrongly, to be greatly expanded Executive authority in recent years, causing enormous concern in a number of different ways. Let me go back into your past. In trying to get Senate documents, one of the documents withheld was a draft memo titled, ‘‘Establishment of NHAO,’’ the Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office. This office was used by President Reagan to give aid to the Nicaraguan contras following the passage of the Boland amendment, and that was a prohibition on providing funding to the contras. What involvement did you have with the Nicaraguan Humanitarian Assistance Office? Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I’m not familiar with the memorandum. If it was withheld, it was probably withheld from me as well, and I don’t recall any involvement. So, you know, I don’t recall any— Senator FEINSTEIN. Okay. Fair enough. Judge ROBERTS. I do know that there was an issue—an issue was raised. I have seen memoranda that I know have been released about private fundraising activities, and I do know that I gave advice in order to make sure that they didn’t engage in lobbying activities in order to be consistent with the Boland amendment. I’ve seen those, but beyond that, I’m not recalling anything. Senator FEINSTEIN. Do you believe that the administration’s provision of funds to the contras exceeded the Executive’s power in light of the Boland amendment’s prohibition on funding the contras? Judge ROBERTS. You know, it’s not something I’ve—I just sort of know what I’ve read in the papers about it. And, you know, it seemed to me that it did. But, again, that’s just based on—it’s not based on a study or a legal analysis, just sort of—I think a lot of it— Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, it’s a pretty simple question. I mean, when the Congress passes a law that says don’t fund something and the Executive finds a covert way to fund it, and as you know, one of the great redeeming qualities of President Reagan was that he gave an admission of wrongdoing, and I think the American people accepted that. He was able to admit a mistake, which I tend to think, you know, is hard to do in this arena. But in a way, it is a sign of a big person to be able to come forward and say, ‘‘I was wrong.’’ So on its face, what you are saying, if I understand you, is you do believe that the provision of funds exceeded the Executive power in this instance. Judge ROBERTS. Well, again, I haven’t done a legal study, but based on what I know, which is just what every citizen knows from reading—I think it all took place after I was no longer in the Government, or at least came to light after that. It seemed to be inconsistent with the law. Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me ask you a general question then. If an Executive exercises power in direct violation of an Act of Congress, is such an act unconstitutional?

429
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the answer depends, Senator, and this is where you get back to the Youngstown analysis, where Justice Jackson said there are three categories: you can act with Congress’ support, being unclear what Congress’s position is—and he recognized a third category where you can act—the Executive may act in the face of a congressional prohibition. And there are certain areas where the Executive does have authority to the exclusion of Congress. You know, without stating a legal view, for example, one that law professors regularly talk about is the pardon power. In other words, that’s given expressly to the President in the Constitution. And restrictions, if Congress were to pass a restriction on the pardon power, does the President nonetheless have the authority to act under the Constitution? That’s a difficult question. But it may be that the President’s authority would trump Congress’ authority.
So I can’t answer a question in the abstract without knowing exactly what the record is and what the situation is. What Justice Jackson said in Youngstown, though, is obviously true, that if the President is acting in the face of congressional opposition, his power is at its lowest ebb. As Jackson put it, it includes his powers less whatever powers Congress has. So if it’s in an area in which Congress has legitimate authority to act, that would restrict the Executive’s authority.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Which this case was. All right. Senator Kennedy engaged you in, I think, a substantive discussion on the civil rights issue, and you did let a little bit of the man come through, and I commend you for that. Thank you very much. Let me talk about Gonzaga for a minute, because if I understand it, you argued that the Spending Clauses are not the supreme law of the land but should be viewed as contracts between the Federal Government and the States, right? Judge ROBERTS. No. Senator FEINSTEIN. Okay. Judge ROBERTS. It was not a dispute about it being the supreme law of the land. There is no dispute about that, that when Congress passes legislation, under the Supremacy Clause it’s the supreme law of the land. The question is what remedies are available. It’s a very simple problem. You folks give money to the States, and you say you can spend this money on educational programs. But if you accept our money, you have to do this, this, and this. Senator FEINSTEIN. Right. Judge ROBERTS. And the question is, well, what happens if somebody comes into court and says they accepted the money, Congress said if you take our money you have to do this, they didn’t do it, they violated my rights under this provision, what happens then? Now, in many cases, Congress will say if these rights are violated, you can sue in court and you can make that State institution—in this case, not a State institution, a private university. The same thing, they’ve accepted the funds. You can make them pay damages. But in other cases, the argument is, well, the condition was imposed by the Federal Government, and the Federal Government should enforce any violations. And you don’t necessarily have the right to sue for damages. That’s the question.

430
It’s an issue that would never come up if Congress would say in each law if you violate this provision, you can sue in Federal court, or you can’t sue in Federal court. Or as in this case, we are going to set up an office in the Department of Education that is going to police compliance, and if you violate this provision, that office is going to come down on the university and make them comply, make them do whatever they need to do to get back into compliance.
There’s no dispute that the university in this case is bound by the condition. The question is: Does an individual who’s harmed by their violation get to sue about it? And sometimes it comes out that they can, as in the Wilder case. Sometimes it comes out that they can’t. The determination is that Congress did not intend there to be a private lawsuit to enforce that. And that was the conclusion in the Gonzaga case.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, let me ask you: Do you believe that State obligations created by Congress through the Spending Clause are enforceable by citizens in the courts?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, the answer there is it depends on that law. In Gonzaga what the Court determined was that provision at issue there was not enforceable by private citizens in the courts. It was enforceable by the Federal Government. The Federal Government can cut off the funds. More likely, the Federal Government can enforce the provision through proceedings against the university.
In the Wilder case, a different statute, the Court determined the condition in that case, the Medicare—or Medicaid funding case was enforceable, a private citizen could go into court because the review of Congress’ intent in that case came out differently than it did in the Gonzaga case.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Well, let me just finish this quickly. I am not a lawyer and I don’t really know how to ask this question, but let me try. When is it a contract and when is it the law? Because if it is a contract, that affects a whole host of laws that we pass that are very important—Medicaid, Title IX, No Child Left Behind, even the Internet Protection Act, all of these things. So when does a contract attach?
Judge ROBERTS. It’s always a contract, and sometimes if the intent of Congress is that private parties be allowed to sue, it’s more than a contract. But it’s always at least a contract.
Senator FEINSTEIN. So the intent has to be a specific intent. Judge ROBERTS. It doesn’t—no, the courts don’t require that. They don’t require that you specifically say you have the right to sue. But the Court has to look at it and try to figure out did you intend—when you put this provision in, did you intend private parties to be able to sue for damages? Or did you expect the Department of Education to enforce that and have the authority to cut off the funds or to impose other conditions because a university is violating it? And as I’ve said, some cases come out one way, and some cases come out the other way. But in each of those cases, what the Court is trying to do is figure out what you, the Congress, meant in that statute. Senator FEINSTEIN. I think my time is up. Thank you very much. Thank you. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Feingold, you are recognized for 20 minutes. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for your willingness to allow us this additional round, and thank you, Judge Roberts, for all your patience throughout this whole process. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Senator FEINGOLD. A topic we touched on in our meeting in my office in July was the issue of judges going to judicial education conferences at sometimes fancy resorts, which are put on by ideologically oriented groups and paid for by private corporations that sometimes even have cases pending before the judges in attendance. And when we spoke, of course, you had been nominated for the Associate Justice position, and our conversation concerned your personal interest in attending such events. As I remember, your answer was that you said you would rather spend your free time with your family, which I thought was a pretty good answer. But now you have been nominated for Chief Justice, and one of your duties is to head the Judicial Conference, which among other things, sets the ethics policies for the Federal judiciary. And this is one area where I think Chief Justice Rehnquist might have taken a different course. He took a number of steps to essentially leave this ethical question up to the personal decision of individual judges and appointed a judge to head the Committee on Codes of Conduct who had been prominently featured in a ‘‘20/20’’ expose of these junkets. Not surprisingly, the Committee weakened the judicial ethics rules on this question of privately financed trips. Chief Justice Rehnquist strongly opposed congressional efforts to put a halt to these judicial junkets that I believe sometimes reflect poorly on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary. So I would like to know, Judge Roberts, if confirmed, whether you will use your power as Chief Justice to set a high ethical tone for the Federal judiciary by putting in place new codes of conduct that would prohibit judges from participating in privately funded ‘‘judicial education’’ that lets special interests essentially lobby Federal judges? Judge ROBERTS. Well, I don’t think special interests should be allowed to lobby Federal judges. Stated that way, I think the answer is clear. I don’t know enough about how these things operate. As I said, I have not been on one of them. I don’t know how the funding is set up. I don’t know what the situation is. If confirmed, I’m certainly happy to examine it. I know that there is a conflict of interest or ethical standard review group, I think, within the Judicial Conference. I believe they addressed that question and issued an opinion on it recently. But, again, I am just sort of recollecting something I read. I would say more generally, though—and maybe it is off topic, in which case feel free to cut me off. But I do think it is important for judges and Justices to get out, particularly get out of Washington a little bit. I’ve always enjoyed going to the law schools, participating in the moot courts or, you know, functions where you get to visit with the law students. I’ve done that a few times—not a lot, a few times. I wouldn’t call that by any stretch of the imagination ‘‘a junket.’’ But I do think it’s important for the Justices to get

out around the country and particularly visit the law schools. That is probably not the same sort of thing you are talking about.
Senator FEINGOLD. Fair enough, and I think you would agree that there is nothing wrong with judges or Senators golfing. That is not the question.
Judge ROBERTS. It may not be good for the game of golf, but... [Laughter.] Senator FEINGOLD. In 2000, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote a letter supporting repeal of a provision of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 that bans honoraria for judges. Do you believe that the law should be changed to permit judges to take honoraria for speeches or appearances? Judge ROBERTS. There again, Senator, that’s not an issue I’ve looked at. I know the law prohibits that. I know that there was a case about that, and the Supreme Court decided that, to some extent, that prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to lower-level officials but constitutional as applied to others. It’s not a question that I’ve addressed. Senator FEINGOLD. Just to return for the record for a moment, the item that the judge referred to in terms of a Judicial Conference opinion is actually the policy that I was concerned about that I thought was a step backward, and I just wanted that reflected in the record. I also, Mr. Chairman, want to put an item in the record. I am not going to ask more questions about Judge Roberts’s memo recommending against the President stating that HIV could not be transmitted through casual contact. But I do want to make sure the record is complete. I would like to submit for the record Judge Roberts’s memo on that issue from September 1985, Centers for Disease Control documents from 1982 and 1985, and a number of news stories from August and September 1985, reporting the CDC’s conclusion that HIV could not be spread through casual contact. I would note that there are several articles in this collection from the Washington Post on September 4, 1985, the date of the article that Senator Coburn submitted yesterday, that I think makes this clear as well. Mr. Chairman, if those items could be entered in the record? Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, so ordered. Senator FEINGOLD. Turning again to the death penalty, when you worked in the Reagan administration, you expressed strong opposition to Federal courts reviewing criminal convictions and State courts reviewing writs of habeas corpus. As you know, prisoners who believe they were wrongly or unfairly convicted in State court can seek to have the Federal courts hear their claims via a writ of habeas corpus. Habeas corpus is a fundamental part of our legal system that has long protected individual freedom. In a 1981 memo, you argued that the availability of Federal habeas relief to State prisoners ‘‘goes far to making a mockery of the entire criminal justice system.’’ In that same memo, you said, ‘‘The question would seem to be not what tinkering is necessary in the system but, rather, why have Federal habeas corpus at all? ’’

433
Then in 1983, as Senator Leahy brought up yesterday, you suggested that if the Supreme Court wanted to reduce its caseload, it should ‘‘abdicat[e], the role of fourth or fifth guesser in death penalty cases.’’ Not in First Amendment cases or antitrust cases, but death penalty cases.
I know that you’ve said that your memos in the Reagan administration reflected the views of the administration and not your own. But in this area, at least, your memos clearly indicate, I think, that these were your views. With the 1981 memo, for example, there is a cover note in your handwriting directing that the memo be sent to Jon Rose, an Assistant Attorney General at the time, with a cover note that reads, ‘‘The attached memorandum contains some thoughts on habeas corpus reform, for whatever you think they’re worth. Judge Friendly and Justice Rehnquist would never have forgiven me if I remained mute.’’ That sounds a lot like a memo advocating your views, not those of the Department.
With regard to the memo from 1983 that I mentioned, you were analyzing the Chief Justice’s proposal to create another intermediate appellate court to take the pressure off the Supreme Court’s docket, and you said, and I quote, ‘‘My own view’’—‘‘My own view is that it is a terrible idea.’’ And you went on to say that the fault lies with the Justices themselves who take too many cases, including death penalty cases.
And you sent a personal letter to Judge Friendly in 1981 that said, ‘‘This is an exciting time to be at the Justice Department when so much that has been taken for granted for so long is being seriously reconsidered. To cite just one example, serious thought is being given to reform of habeas corpus. . . . I do not know what will eventuate as you noted, what has come to pass as the Great Writ is regarded by many lawmakers with no idea of the problems as unalterable perfection.’’
Now, that discussion in a personal letter sounds like your own opinion as well. A decade later, when you were at the Solicitor General’s office during the first Bush administration, you signed several briefs that sought to strictly limit Federal habeas review. And in 1993, while in private practice, you testified before the House Republican Task Force on Crime in favor of further habeas restrictions.
The comments in your memos from the 1980’s, I am sorry to say, don’t even show the slightest concern about innocent lives possibly being lost if Federal habeas were eliminated. Does the possible hostility toward the habeas process that was expressed in those memos, particularly in death penalty cases, reflect your current view on Federal habeas? Or have your views changed or evolved?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, as you know, the law has changed and evolved dramatically since the early 1980’s, and at least with respect to my personal letter to Judge Friendly—I guess I thought it was a personal letter—
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. But the situation has changed dramatically, as you know. What I was referring to in the early 1980’s was a situation where there were no limits on repetitive habeas corpus petitions, four, five, six, dozens of different petitions could be filed repetitively. Congress saw that as a problem. Congress acted to ad-

434
dress the very concerns that I was raising there in past legislation. The Supreme Court saw it as a problem. The Supreme Court acted in a number of cases, the Teague case and others, in limiting the availability of successive and repetitive habeas petitions.
Actually, what happened is the Supreme Court, I think, started down that path, and Congress made the decision that this is something they should look at in a more comprehensive way. So Congress passed laws that restrict when people can file repetitive and successive petitions. Those are the very concerns that I was talking about. They were concerns that had motivated the first person I worked for as a lawyer, Judge Henry Friendly, to write on the subject. He wrote a famous article on habeas reform entitled ‘‘Is Innocence Irrelevant? ’’ because he thought these successive petitions had made sort of a game out of the whole process in which the question of innocence was totally lost in these successive petitions.
And the references to the Great Writ, yes, of course, the writ of habeas corpus has an established heritage as a basis for complaining about illegal confinement. But all the stuff we are talking about there—the fourth and fifth successive petitions, raising new issues that should have been raised in the first petition—and as you know, that’s what Congress’ legislation focused on.
Senator FEINGOLD. But, Judge, did you not at the time, as I read in your statement, advocate the abolition of Federal habeas review?
Judge ROBERTS. No. The purpose of what I was saying was to certainly reform and abolish the system as it existed then, where people could file repetitive and successive petitions, and I’ll tell you why. The main problem—and I think it’s a particular concern in death cases—is that nobody along the way feels that they’re making the responsible decision. If people get in a situation where they know, okay, if you’re on a jury and you sentence someone to death, if you think, well, he’s going to file habeas petitions in State court, and they’re going to look at it then, after that—and the person who considers the State habeas petition says, ‘‘I know there are going to be successive Federal habeas petitions, they’ll look at the issue then,’’ everybody is pointing fingers in opposite directions.
When Congress reformed this system, I think it helped to make clear that the decisions that are going to be made on the first habeas petition are going to be critical, and so hopefully it’s looked at a lot more carefully than in the prior system when you knew, well, that wasn’t the end of the process, it wasn’t even the beginning of the end; the conviction was just the end of the beginning.
Senator FEINGOLD. Well, would you agree that had the view that you advocated in your memos prevailed in the early 1980’s—the abolition of the writ and the entire removal of Federal habeas review of State court convictions had that happened, innocent people would have been executed and serious constitutional errors would have gone unaddressed?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, that wasn’t my position. Senator FEINGOLD. No, but I am asking— Judge ROBERTS. No, my— Senator FEINGOLD. Had that view prevailed, not necessarily your personal view, but the abolition of the writ, isn’t it the case that innocent people would have been—

435
Judge ROBERTS. Oh, I’m not in favor now and was not in favor then of not allowing any Federal habeas review.
Senator FEINGOLD. I am asking you whether you wouldn’t agree that as a matter of fact—
Judge ROBERTS. Yes. Senator FEINGOLD.—had the writ been eliminated, that some innocent people would have been executed? Judge ROBERTS. Well, they certainly wouldn’t have been able to assert their claim of innocence in Federal habeas— Senator FEINGOLD. Would not have— Judge ROBERTS.—and people do succeed at that stage. I certainly think it serves a valuable purpose. But that, again, was not—you know, the situation with respect to habeas 23 years ago was quite different than it is today, and the reason it’s changed, I think, is because Congress responded to those sorts of concerns. Senator FEINGOLD. I take those comments as very important, and I know you can’t comment on this, but there are further efforts now to further limit this right that could come before you. And I know you can’t comment on it, but I think it is of great significance that you have acknowledged that some of those changes that were made in the 1990’s have significantly affected your view about the propriety of the habeas process. On a different subject, after the passing of Chief Justice Rehnquist, a number of news articles discussed his legacy and noted that early in his tenure as Justice, he had been a dissenting voice, but the Court seemed to shift in his direction over time. Recently, Professor Cass Sunstein recalled that over lunch with a group of Supreme Court clerks when he was an Associate Justice, Chief Justice Rehnquist described his own role on the Court. He said the Court was like a boat that had tilted way over to one side, and his task was to put it upright again. Do you believe that the Chief Justice has the duty to influence the overall philosophical direction of the Court through his personal leadership or through opinion-writing assignments or any other means? And do you think that it is appropriate for the Chief to do that? Judge ROBERTS. I don’t think using opinion-writing assignments as a way to try to promote a particular view or agenda is a good idea. And I don’t think Chief Justice Rehnquist did that. I do think if you go back and look at every year that he was the Chief Justice and just pick out what you think are the 10 or 12 biggest cases of that year, I think you will find that those cases are distributed very evenly among the nine Justices. And one reason I think relations among the Justices were so collegial under Chief Justice Rehnquist’s leadership—at a time when, of course, the Court had very marked philosophical differences and sharp dissents in some areas, but everybody got along well—is because the Chief made a priority of being fair in his opinion assignments. I think that is the more important priority. Senator FEINGOLD. Can you imagine ever changing your vote in order to be able to assign the majority opinion to yourself or to another Justice? And do you think that such a practice is appropriate? Judge ROBERTS. No, I don’t, in answer to both questions.

436
Senator FEINGOLD. So you would not do that. Judge ROBERTS. I wouldn’t do that. I think that, again, sort of trying to use that assignment power in a tactical way, it causes tension on the Court and I think undermines the ability of the Chief Justice, to the extent he has that ability—and it’s obviously limited—to act as a force to help bring about some cohesiveness and collegiality. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you. Thank you for that answer. On a different subject, some people blame plaintiffs’ lawyers for various problems with the economy and the legal profession. Do you believe that lawyers who represent indigent persons in product liability and medical malpractice cases are harming America? Judge ROBERTS. No. Senator FEINGOLD. Having worked on the defense side for most of your non-Government career, can you be fair in your rulings to plaintiffs seeking redress for injury? Judge ROBERTS. I’m going to disagree with your premise. I’ve represented plaintiffs’ interests. I think if you look, for example, at the antitrust cases I’ve argued, more of them have been on the plaintiff side than on the defendant side. One of my co-clerks, when I clerked for Justice Rehnquist, is a very prominent personal injury lawyer, and I think he does a wonderful job. I know there are abuses in this area. There are abuses in the area of defense representation as well. I certainly don’t have any biases one way or the other. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Judge. Judge, you argued an important case before the Supreme Court concerning who is protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was called Toyota v. Williams. Ms. Williams suffered from hand, wrist, and arm pain while working in an engine assembly line. She was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome, and her physician placed her on permanent work restrictions. Her pain continued and she did not think that her employer was addressing her physician-ordered work restrictions appropriately, so she sued under the ADA. You represented Toyota in the case before the Supreme Court, and this was a case of statutory interpretation, so I assume you are quite familiar with the legislative history of that Act. Do you agree with the statement of one of the Justices during oral argument that the Act was primarily intended to protect people who are ‘‘wheelchair-bound’’? Judge ROBERTS. The Act contains a definition of disability, and that’s what the issue was about, and that definition does not contain that type of restriction. So, you know, I don’t want to comment on issues that might come before me, but the case was about the definition. The definition was not restricted in that way. The only point I would make—and I’m sure you appreciate this— is that a lot of times the statements during oral argument are certainly not expressions of either the Justices’ view—they’re often playing a devil’s advocate, and I don’t even remember that question. I don’t know if it was directed at me or the other counsel, but it may well have been intended to elicit a response to flesh out more fully what the definition was.

Senator FEINGOLD. More generally, do you believe that the ADA or any other civil rights statute should be interpreted narrowly or broadly when it comes to the issue of who it protects?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I have to say I think it should be interpreted consistent with Congress’s intent, and you look at a lot of different factors in trying to flesh that out.
If you folks here in Congress had a particular—in any statute, a narrow focus, then to give that focus a broader impact I think would be wrong. If you had a broad focus, as, of course, you often do when you’re dealing with statutes designed to address discrimination, giving that interpretation a narrow focus would be wrong.
The effort in every case is to try to give it the right focus, and that’s the focus that you intended when you passed the law.
Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Judge, and I appreciate all your answers.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Feingold. Senator Sessions has asked for recognition briefly to clarify one point which he thinks requires that clarification. Senator SESSIONS. Thank you. Judge Roberts, I commend you on your good humor, and even when they read a memo to suggest you said that the EEOC was un-American, when actually all you were doing was quoting a complaint, and that you defended the EEOC and its rights and independence aggressively in that memo. But I wanted to ask you about this Texas case. As I understand it, Texas decided that they would not fund education for illegal aliens that are here in the country. And that was challenged as being unconstitutional and went to the Supreme Court. I know you have said that you as a parent and as a person who believes in education, you absolutely believe in education for all children in some way, form, or fashion. But you don’t mean to suggest or prejudge, do you, the constitutionality of the right of the State of Texas to make that decision? That would be a matter of, I think, some importance, and perhaps again in the years to come. Judge ROBERTS. Well, no, Senator, and I did try to be very careful in separating the personal views with respect to the importance of education from the legal question there. And the legal question, of course, was a close one. It divided the Court 5–4, and as I noted, among the dissenters were Justices White and O’Connor. And I don’t think their legal position reflected any less than wholehearted view concerning the importance of education. Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Senator Schumer is recognized for 15 minutes. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, just a little housekeeping. I think tomorrow is the day that it is due for us to submit written questions, and you will have no problem getting those back to us before we have to vote, which I think by the agreement of the Chairman and the Ranking Member will be next Thursday, will you? Judge ROBERTS. Well, it depends how many there are. [Laughter.]

Judge ROBERTS. My answers will be fuller the fewer questions there are, but I will certainly—
[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I will certainly obviously make every effort to get them in as soon as possible. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. Next question: We have had a great debate here in the Senate and with the administration about the documents—there were 16 cases, I think, led by Senator Leahy, that the eight of us requested when you were Principal Deputy Solicitor General. Now, we know the administration has said they will not relinquish those documents. I just wanted to know—and I am not asking your view on the law. Do you have a personal objection if they were to give us those documents? Because you wrote them. Judge ROBERTS. Senator, I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to take a position. If the client is asserting a privilege, I don’t think the attorney should be stating a position on it, because in these situations the privilege is that of the client. And for the attorney to take a position would, could, might put pressure on the client and— Senator SCHUMER. I may not get— Judge ROBERTS.—I think that’s inappropriate. Senator SCHUMER. I may not get this. Aren’t they the attorney and you the client this time? Judge ROBERTS. Well, when the memos were prepared, I was the attorney. Senator SCHUMER. I see. Judge ROBERTS. And they were the client. Senator SCHUMER. So you won’t take a position on that. Judge ROBERTS. I don’t think it’s appropriate for a lawyer to do so. Senator SCHUMER. Yesterday, as I told you, I was sort of confounded by the refusal to answer certain questions. I do not think any of us expected you to answer every question or answer the— give us the answer the way we want it. But we did hope that you would answer enough questions with enough specificity so that we and the American people would get a clear picture of the kind of Chief Justice you will be, not just rely on your assurances. So I want to try this another way because I really want to find out. You are one of the best litigators in America. You know how to convince people. That is what you have been paid to do for a long time. So let me ask you, if you were sitting here, what question would you ask John Roberts so that you or us could be sure that we were not nominating what I call an ideologue, someone who you might define as somebody who wants to make law, not interpret law? And then how would you answer the question you asked yourself? [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I’d begin by saying, ‘‘Well, that’s a good question, Senator.’’ [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I think, with respect, I would ask a lot of the questions that have been asked, a lot of the questions that were asked in the questionnaire that I completed earlier, and it begins

with the most important question, What is your view of the proper role of a judge in our system? And people have different answers to that question. I’ve given an answer to that question.
How do you approach particular cases in areas of particular interest? And I’ve been asked that question and I’ve given an answer. I’ve explained, for example, in the area of Executive power, as issues arise what the framework that I would use would be, and I’ve talked about the Youngstown opinion and Justice Jackson’s framework there.
I’ve talked about how I would approach cases involving the right to privacy under the Liberty Clause. I’ve talked about how I would approach cases involving Government enforcement in the antitrust—
Senator SCHUMER. How about something that you have not—a question that has not been asked since some of us are still unsure?
Judge ROBERTS. But in other areas people talk about—and it is personal views on issues, and there again, I think it is important. There may be some nominees who want to share personal views on issues. My reaction has been to emphasize—and I think this tells you about what kind of a judge I hope I am on the Court of Appeals and what kind of a Justice I would be if confirmed, and my reaction has been that I set those personal views aside, and so don’t consider them pertinent. Other nominees might take a different approach in response to those types of questions.
People have asked about particular decisions, and I’ve talked about decisions in which I’ve been involved. We’ve talked about— with Senator Grassley about the Totten case in which I was involved, others about the Barber case involving Congress’s power under the Spending Clause.
People have asked very probing questions about my legal positions. What did you—what was the position you were advocating in this case and why? I think it’s fair to talk about the record.
Senator SCHUMER. Any question that you would ask that has been left out?
Judge ROBERTS. There have been a lot of questions asked and a lot answered. I can’t think of any that—you know, I expected people to ask me about this and it hasn’t been asked.
Senator SCHUMER. So I guess we did a better job than we think we did, right?
Judge ROBERTS. I think the Committee has been very effective over the last several days in learning a lot about me. I think in the process of meeting with the Senators before—and I was quite serious when I said I appreciated how accommodating everyone had been in sitting down with me. I think people learned a lot about me. I think you can learn a lot about me from looking at the 50 opinions I’ve written. You can learn about—
Senator SCHUMER. Let me, if I might. I want to go back to the Commerce Clause, which bothers me, as you know. Again, apart from anybody’s view, do you agree that the Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate activities that are purely local, so long as Congress finds that the activities exert a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce?
Judge ROBERTS. If the question—and this is where the issue comes up—is whether or not as the Court has addressed it, the ac-

tivities are commercial. If the activities are commercial in nature, you get to aggregate them under Wickard v. Filburn that we have talked about. You do not have to look at just that particular activity. You look at the activity in general. Where the dispute and issues come in is whether the activities are commercial. That is where the disagreement—the point I was trying to make in the infamous or famous toad case. If you should look at this as commercial activity, then you can—
Senator SCHUMER. Do you believe Congress deserves a great— this is in reference to some of the things Senator Specter talked about—that Congress deserves a great deal of deference when it decides something is commercial and has findings to that effect?
Judge ROBERTS. I do, Senator, and I think that is the basic theme that runs through the Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence. There is again of course the Lopez and Morrison decisions, but there is also the Raiche decision, and again I think it is very important to—and what the Raiche decision said is you’ve got to consider Lopez and Morrison in the context of this broad sweep, not just as sort of the only decisions.
Senator SCHUMER. Okay. Let me ask you then this hypothetical, and that is: that it came to our attention, Congress’s, through a relatively and inexpensive simple process individuals were now able to clone certain species of animals, maybe an arroyo toad; did not pass over State lines, you could somehow do it without doing any of that. Under the Commerce Clause can Congress pass a law banning even non-commercial cloning?
Judge ROBERTS. I appreciate it’s a hypothetical and you will as well, so I don’t mean to be giving binding opinions. But it would seem to me that Congress can make a determination that this is an activity, if allowed to be pursued, that is going to have effects on interstate commerce. Obviously, if you were successful in cloning an animal, that’s not going to be simply a local phenomenon, that’s going to be something people are going to—
Senator SCHUMER. You can leave it at that. That is a good answer as far as I am concerned.
What I would like to do is say a few concluding words here with a final request. First I want to thank you for holding up so well during the 3 days of grueling questions. Many of us on this Committee, probably every one of us, some more than others, have been wrestling with how to vote on your nomination since well before the hearing started, and of course now that process is accelerated. I, for one, have woken up in the middle of the night thinking about it, being unsure how to vote. I think my colleague from Delaware was on to something when he called this a roll of the dice.
But this is a vote on the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. You will in all likelihood affect every one of our lives in many ways for a whole generation, so this is not just rolling the dice. It is betting the whole house.
I thought I would share with you some of the thoughts of some of us with important questions; there are pros and cons. On the pro side first of all is your brilliance. You have an amazing knowledge of the law. You spent 3 days here talking on so many aspects of it without any paper in front of you, without a single aide coming over and whispering in your ear or passing you a note. Your knowl-
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00452 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

441
edge of law and your way of presenting it is a tour de force. You may very well possess the most powerful intellect of any person to come before the Senate for this position.
Second on the pro side is that you seem to be a lawyer above all. You have devoted your entire life to the law, and it is clear that you love it. Most people in that position tend not to be ideologues. They will follow the law wherever it takes them, regardless of the consequences, and you have repeatedly professed that to be true for you. But given that you have spent most of your legal life representing others, and that your limited tenure on the Court of Appeals did not allow you to rule on very many non-technical cases, there is not a long enough track record to prove that point.
The third and perhaps the most important, at least to me, is your judicial philosophy of modesty and stability. Such a theory respects precedent, the Congress and other judges’ opinions. Modest jurists tend not to be ideologues, and many of us on this side of the aisle would like the Court to maintain, and in cases related to the Commerce Clause like Morrison, increase its modesty.
But in complicated decisions like this one, there is always a counterpoint even on the modesty question. Yesterday you said that the decision of Brown v. Board could be described as modest. Brown v. Board was breathtaking. It was wonderful. It reversed 80 years of accepted but bad law, yes, but modest? So I ask myself could overturning Wickard or Roe also be modest by your definition?
Nonetheless, I think the philosophy of modesty is an appealing, important, and unifying philosophy to many of us.
Let me go to the con side here. First is the question of compassion and humanity. I said on the first days of these hearings it is important to determine not just the quality of your mind, but the fullness of your heart, by which I think a good number of us, at least, on both sides of the aisle really, mean the ability to truly empathize with those who are less fortunate and who often need the protections of the Government and the assistance of the law to have any chance at all. It did not seem much, for instance, to concede that the wording ‘‘illegal amigos’’ was unfortunate, yet you refused to say so. America has moved in the 21st century beyond what Senator Kennedy called ‘‘the cramped view of civil rights professed in the early Reagan administration.’’ But you would not admit now in 2005 that any of those views you argued for in the early ‘80’s were misguided, with the hindsight of history. That is troubling.
Second is the refusal of the administration to let us see any documents you wrote when you served as Deputy Solicitor General, when you were not simply following policy, which you have reminded us in your earlier days there and in the Counsel’s office, but making it. This would have given us tremendous insight into who you are, into actually knowing who you are and what kind of justice you would make. But for what seemed to be self-serving reasons they were refused. Now this was not your decision, but you carry its burden, and I think we all have to consider it when weighing how to vote.
Third, and most important on the con side, is your refusal to answer so many of our questions. I know you feel you were more

forthcoming than most any other nominee to the High Court. I must disagree. You certainly were more forthcoming than a few. Now, for instance, I do not know Justice Scalia’s opinion on ‘‘Dr. Zhivago,’’ but most answered more relevant questions than you did. Your refused to comment on any issue that you thought may come before the Court. We learned a lot about your views on older, completely discredited cases like Lochner and Plessy and Korematsu, but they are not of much help to us. What we need to know are the kinds of things that are coming before the Court now, and not knowing makes it hard to figure out what kind of Justice you will be, particularly in light of the fact we have little else to go on.
You did speak at length on many issues and sounded like you were conveying your views to us, but when one went back and read the transcript each evening, there was less than met the ear that afternoon. Perhaps that is the job of a good litigator, but in too many instances it did not serve the purpose of the hearing.
Having said that about documents and questions, obtaining documents and answering questions are a means to an end, not an end in itself. In some cases like Miguel Estrada’s nomination, we had no knowledge of his views so we could not vote. But here there is clearly some evidence. So now we must take the evidence we have and try to answer the fundamental question: what kind of Justice will John Roberts be? Will you be a truly modest, temperate, careful judge in the tradition of Harlan, Jackson, Frankfurter and Friendly? Will you be a very conservative judge who will impede congressional prerogatives but who does not use the bench to remake society like Justice Rehnquist? Or will you use your enormous talents to use the Court to turn back a near century of progress and create the majority that Justices Scalia and Thomas could not achieve? That is the question that we on the Committee will have to grapple with this week.
And over the next week, if you have any more information that could help us answer this question, I think every one of us would welcome it. Thank you, Judge.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Schumer. Senator FEINSTEIN. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Wait just a minute. I will recognize you in a moment. Judge Roberts, Senator Schumer has postulated quite a number of questions in his last soliloquy, but— [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER.—they are summarized in what kind of a Justice you would be, and I think you are entitled to respond to that if you care to do so. Senator FEINSTEIN. That was going to be my request. I think it would be very important. Chairman SPECTER. In that case, go ahead and make your request. [Laughter.] Senator FEINSTEIN. Yes. I think— Chairman SPECTER. Better the request comes from you than from me, Senator Feinstein.

443
Senator FEINSTEIN. I think that Senator Schumer really summed up the dilemmas, and not only for himself but for our side. I would very much like you to respond, particularly to the con side. The pro side speaks for itself. Many of us are struggling with exactly that, what kind of a Justice would you be, Judge Roberts?
Chairman SPECTER. No time limit, Judge. Judge ROBERTS. Well, I appreciate the comments very much, Senator Schumer, and I very much appreciate the pro side of the ledger. On the con side, the issue of documents, it is hard for me to comprehend that there could be more documents. The numbers been ranging from 80,000 to 100,000, and there is a lot of paper out there. I have tried to be as fully responsive as I thought consistent with my obligations as a sitting judge and a nominee. And I appreciate that this is not a new issue. You have gone back and read the transcripts and of course participated. I have gone back and read the transcripts. It comes up at every nomination. In some instances Members of the Committee want more information than the nominee feels that he or she can give in good conscience. That is nothing new. I have tried to be as fully expansive as I can be, and drawn the line where as a practical matter I think it is necessary and appropriate. The basic question, Senator Feinstein and Senator Schumer, what kind of a Justice would I be? That is the judgment you have to make. I would begin, I think, if I were in your shoes, with what kind of a judge I have been. I appreciate that it has only been a little more than 2 years, but you do have 50 opinions. You can look at those. And, Senator Schumer, I don’t think you can read those opinions and say that these are the opinions of an ideologue. You may think they’re not enough. You may think you need more of a sample. That is your judgment. But I think if you’ve looked at what I’ve done since I took the judicial oath, that should convince you that I’m not an ideologue, and you and I agree that that’s not the sort of person we want on the Supreme Court. Beyond that I have the few days that I’ve been here, all the documents, the questionnaire. You have not just my opinions but my briefs. I think those also help show what kind of a judge I would be. You of course appreciate that that’s presenting a position and I’m just an advocate, but advocates deal with the law in different ways. You can look at other people’s briefs, I think, and conclude that that person may not be a good judge because of the way they argue the law. I would hope you would look at my briefs and my arguments before the Supreme Court and conclude that that’s a person who respects the law, respects the Court before whom he is arguing, and will approach the law in a similar way as a judge. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Judge Roberts. Senator CORNYN. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Senator Cornyn. Senator CORNYN. If I might have three minutes. I would just want to ask the witness to explain the rationale as he understands it for the privilege—

444
Chairman SPECTER. Senator Cornyn, you are recognized for three minutes.
Senator CORNYN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, it strikes me as odd, having been on the Committee last year when we had an alleged theft of internal documents that were written by staffers of individual Senators, and which were then published to the outside world, and there was bipartisan outrage over that. And we, as I recall, referred that matter for investigation and possible prosecution.
But surely if the legislative branch is entitled to confidential communications between our lawyers and us so we can do our jobs and get candid advice, the Executive or the President is entitled to the same sort of confidential and candid communications.
And, Judge, this is the question. I do not want anybody to be under the misapprehension that, number one, it is within your power to produce additional documents. It is hard to imagine there are in addition to the 100,000 that have already been produced. But I want to give you a chance to articulate the reasons why the law recognizes this importance of a confidential, candid communication between a client and the lawyer that cannot be readily overrun or trumped. Would you give that a shot, please?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, I mean certainly the basic attorney/client privilege goes back centuries, and there have been eloquent expressions of its value in the Supreme Court. I think of the Upjohn opinion from 1981 in the Supreme Court and other classic expressions. And the idea is that if we want people to benefit from the advice that lawyers can give, we have to ensure that they feel perfectly free to communicate and exchange their views with their lawyer without fear that that would be reviewed and used to their prejudice.
Carried forward to the point that we are talking about now, you have to have a candid exchange among lawyers in presenting cases to the Court in order to effectively represent your client whether your client is the Government of the United States or a private company. And that type of debate, which often involves pointing out inconsistencies in the decision, even flaws in your own legal position, say, ‘‘This is the argument, but this part of the argument is really quite weak and we have to be worried about that.’’ Those sorts of things you do need to thrash out and discuss and elaborate on. And yet if that was then revealed to your adversary or to the Court, it would obviously prejudice the presentation.
And if those things were going to be regularly revealed, people wouldn’t make those types of analyses and judgments. They wouldn’t say, ‘‘This is a weak argument. What are we going to do about that? Should we really make that argument? ’’ They would not commit those to writing and the adequacy of the legal counsel and advice would suffer, and the role of the advocate before the court in vindicating the rule of law on which the courts rely, would also suffer.
Senator CORNYN. Mr. Chairman, it may already be part of the record, but if it is not, I would ask unanimous consent at this point in the record that we would make the letter of former Solicitor Generals, appointed both by Democrat Presidents and Republican Presidents who agree that these Solicitor General memos should remain protected by the privilege, part of the record.

Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, so ordered. Senator Durbin, you are recognized for 20 minutes. Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Roberts, again, thank you, and you may be nearing the end of the process, which I am sure is a great relief to you and your wife and friends. Let me first address Senator Cornyn’s point. The memos that were stolen from offices of the Senators on this Committee, stolen by a Republican staffer who was discharged, that case was turned over to the Justice Department. I sent a letter to the Attorney General yesterday applauding the fact that the Justice Department had in fact successfully prosecuted in Massachusetts a person who had hacked in and stolen the telephone records of Paris Hilton. And I asked the Attorney General to please ask our Special Counsel in this case to take a look at the precedent of the Paris Hilton case and see if he can perhaps protect our records as much as he wants to protect that poor young lady’s telephone records. [Laughter.] Senator DURBIN. The second aspect I would like to raise is this. Many of these documents we are talking about have been given before. Justice Rehnquist offered similar documents to the Committee for consideration, so it is not unprecedented for us to ask, nor for the Government to produce them on a voluntary basis, no theft involved. If I could clear up a couple other things that have been raised, I read and reread the sentence which you and Senator Kennedy debated about the EEOC, and I want to read it again, conceding the fact that the word ‘‘un-American’’ is in quotes and clearly refers to something else. But the sentence in your memo reads in its entirety as follows: ‘‘We should ignore that assertion in any event, as well as the assertion that the EEOC is ‘un-American’, the truth of the matter notwithstanding.’’ Now, those are your words but for the quotes ‘‘un-American.’’ What did you mean when you say ‘‘the truth of the matter notwithstanding? ’’ It suggests that you agree with that conclusion. Judge ROBERTS. The first part of the sentence refers to that assertion, and that assertion was the assertion that President Reagan had promised to abolish the EEOC. That as the issue that I said in the memorandum I had been unable to determine whether that was accurate or not. It was the truth of that matter, of that assertion that I couldn’t verify. The reference to ‘‘un-American’’ was not my language. It was the language of the person who complained and said, ‘‘You need to do something about the EEOC,’’ and our response was what we’re going to do is make sure that the EEOC is not interfered with because of your complaints. Now, he may have felt that he was being treated in an ‘‘unAmerican’’ way and wanted something done about it. But it was not my view, and again, the language was in quotes to make clear that it wasn’t my view. Senator DURBIN. I do not question the fact the language was in quotes, but I think there is at least some ambiguity in what was said. It might have been said more precisely if the conclusion that we are suggesting does not reflect your views.

If I could I would like to return to a discussion that we had yesterday about a very fundamental question. I asked you yesterday about a case that you handled as an attorney involving a large HMO, in which you advanced a very narrow reading of an Illinois State law. Had your position prevailed, millions of American families stood the risk of losing coverage for their health insurance. You did not prevail, and as you mentioned, it was a closely divided Court, which again underlines the importance of each new Justice as we consider them, but your position did not prevail.
Let me read what you said to me in response. You told me you had no reservations about taking the case, and here is what you said, quote: ‘‘My practice has been to take the cases that come to me, and if the other side in that case had come to me first, I would have taken their side,’’ end of quote. I want to follow up on this.
You have taken some pride in the pro bono cases that you have taken, and I am glad you have. I think that is part of being a professional, accepting pro bono cases. You were asked the other day about your participation in the 1996 case of Romber v. Evans, a landmark case that struck down a Colorado law that would have taken away the rights of gay and lesbian Americans. You gave some legal advice to the lawyer in this case who was trying to uphold the rights of those with different sexual orientation. So I will ask you, if the other side had come to you first and said, ‘‘Mr. Roberts, we would like you to defend the State amendment that took away the rights of gays and lesbians.’’ Would you have taken the case?
Judge ROBERTS. It’s a hypothetical question. Of course, I think I probably would have, Senator. I actually have done pro bono assistance for States on a regular basis through the National Association of Attorneys General, and if I’m remembering right, the State would have been the other party in that case. I think that’s right. And through the State and Legal Center, I participate in moot courts for the States on a regular basis. And a big part of my practice was representing States, so if a State, in that case, Colorado, had come to me and said, ‘‘We have a case in the Supreme Court, would you defend it? ’’ I might—again, I can’t answer without knowing the full details and all that, and I have to look at the legal issues. And I would not, and never have, presented legal arguments that I thought were not reasonable arguments, doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to prevail, and I have certainly lost my share of cases.
But it has not been my general view that I sit in judgment on clients when they come to me. I viewed that as the job of the Court when I was a lawyer. And just as someone once said, you know, it’s the guilty people who really need a good lawyer, I also view that I don’t evaluate whether I as a judge would agree with a particular position when somebody comes to me for what I did, which was provide legal advice and assistance, particularly before the Supreme Court.
Senator DURBIN. I have a long series of hypotheticals that I will not get into, such as, would you have represented that D.C. Government against the welfare families? You spoke to me of your pride in representing the poor people in the District of Columbia on their welfare rights. I could ask you whether you would have

taken the side of the Board of Education in the Brown case. Would you have taken the side of the State of Virginia in Loving? I could have gone through all of those hypotheticals. The purpose is, and the purpose of my original question was this: all of us are trying to get down to what are your core values, where would you draw lines, saying ‘‘I do have principles and values. There are certain things I would not use my legal skills to do because they conflict with those values.’’
If this is just a process, a legal contest, and you will play for any team that asks you to play, it raises a question about where would you draw the line if you would ever draw the line? And I think that is why I have asked this question, and I want to give you an opportunity now to tell us.
Senator Feinstein asked a little earlier today about the Plyler case. You came a little bit further than you did last night in saying—and I think this is a very safe assertion—‘‘Children deserve an education.’’ That is not a headline. But I think that what I would like to get to is the original question here. As a lawyer, do you have standards and values as to the causes and beliefs that are so important to you where you would draw a line?
Judge ROBERTS. Well, let me try to answer it this way, Senator. People become lawyers for different reasons, all perfectly good and noble, and legitimate. People who are interested, for example, in protecting the environment often will go into the law and practice environmental law because they think that is an effective way to advance a cause in which they passionately believe.
People who are committed to the cause of civil rights may become lawyers and become civil rights lawyers and present and press those causes because they are causes in which they passionately believe.
I became a lawyer or at least developed as a lawyer because I believe in the rule of law. The point I was trying to emphasize in my opening statement, that all of these other areas—you believe in civil rights, you believe in environmental protection, whatever the area might be, believe in rights for the disabled, you’re not going to be able or effectively to vindicate those rights if you don’t have a place that you can go where you know you’re going to get a decision based on the rule of law. It was the point I was making with respect to the Soviet Constitution, filled with wonderful-sounding rights, absolutely meaningless, because people who suffered under that system had no place they could go in court and say, ‘‘My rights have been violated.’’ So that’s why I became a lawyer, to promote and vindicate the rule of law.
Now, that means that that’s at issue and play regardless of what the cause is, and that’s why, as we were talking yesterday, you can go in my record and you’ll see, yes, I’ve advanced cases promoting the cause of the environment. As I was discussing earlier, I’ve been on both sides of the affirmative action issue. Take even technical areas like antitrust. I’ve defended corporations; I’ve sued corporations. In each case, I appreciated that what I was doing as a lawyer, particularly as a lawyer before the Supreme Court, was promoting the rule of law in our adversary system. And I viewed that as—I appreciate that to some they may say, well, that sounds like you’re a hired gun, to be disparaging, you are going to take the side
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00459 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

448
of whoever comes in the door first. I think that’s a disparaging way to capture what is, in fact, an ennobling truth about our legal system that lawyers serve the rule of law, above and beyond representing particular clients. That’s why when the Chief Justice welcomes new members to the Supreme Court bar, he welcomes them as members of the bar and as officers of the court, because that is the important role that they play. That has significance for what types of arguments they can present and how they can present them.
Senator DURBIN. Well, if I might say, Judge, if you have made one point many times over the course of the last 3 days, it is that as a judge you will be loyal and faithful to the process of law, to the rule of law. I think that is without question from what you have said. I accept that on its face.
But the questions which we continue to ask you really try to go beyond that, because I said at the outset that I thought one of the real measures as to whether or not you should be on the Supreme Court goes back to a point Senator Simon had made: Would you restrict freedom in America or would you expand it?
When you are defending gays and lesbians who are being restricted in their rights by the Colorado amendment, you are trying, from my point of view, to expand freedom in America. That to me is a positive thing. That is my personal philosophy and point of view.
But then when you say, ‘‘If the State would have walked in the door first to restrict freedoms, I would have taken them as a client, too,’’ I wonder, Where are you? Beyond loyalty to the process of law, how do you view this law when it comes to expanding our personal freedom? Is it important enough for you to say in some instances, ‘‘I will not use my skills as a lawyer because I don’t believe that that is a cause that is consistent with my values and belief’’? That is what I have been asking.
Judge ROBERTS. Well, and the—I had someone ask me in this process—I don’t remember who it was, but somebody asked me, you know, ‘‘Are you going to be on the side of the little guy? ’’ And you obviously want to give an immediate answer, but as you reflect on it, if the Constitution says that the little guy should win, the little guy is going to win in court before me. But if the Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then, the big guy is going to win, because my obligation is to the Constitution. That’s the oath. The oath that a judge takes is not that I will look out for particular interests, I’ll be on the side of particular interests. The oath is to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that’s what I would do.
Senator DURBIN. Would you at least concede that you would take into consideration that in our system of justice the race goes to the swift, and the swift are those with the resources, the money, the lawyers, the power in the system, and that many times the powerless, the person who has struggled and clawed their way to your courtroom, went through a wall of adversity which the powerful never had to face? Is that part of your calculation?
Judge ROBERTS. Absolutely, and it is, again, what’s carved above the doors to the Supreme Court: ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ And the judicial oath talks about doing justice without regard to per-

sons, to rich and to poor. And that, of course, is critically important. You do have to appreciate that there are going to be interests who, for one reason or another, don’t have the same resources as people on the other side. The idea is not to give the case to the side with the best resources, the side with the best lawyers, the side with the most opportunity to prepare and present. It is to decide the case according to the law and according to the Constitution. And as case after case in the Supreme Court shows, that’s often the prisoner who’s sitting in his cell and writes his petition out longhand. Sometimes the Constitution is on that person’s side and not on the side of the corporation with the fancy printed brief. But the judge’s obligation is to appreciate that the rule of law requires that both of those be treated equally under the law.
Senator DURBIN. Judge Roberts, thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Judge ROBERTS. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Durbin. Judge Roberts, questions will be submitted to you within 24 hours, and you have already stated your commitment to answer the questions. And you can’t be totally open-ended because you don’t know how many questions there will be. Senator GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. I have a strong inclination that however many questions there are, you will be able to answer them in appropriate course. We are now going to move into a closed session. Senator Graham? Senator GRAHAM. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. You are recognized. Senator GRAHAM. Just for a couple minutes. I am trying to compile questions from the past where the answers were very similar to the answers of Judge Roberts about ‘‘I can’t comment,’’ ‘‘I can’t answer your question because it may compromise my integrity,’’ the judge in the future. And I would ask for permission of the Committee to get a chance to organize this because there are so many volumes. And what I would like to be able to demonstrate to the Committee is that the pattern that he has displayed in terms of saying ‘‘I can’t give you an answer because it may disqualify me’’ is not unique to the Senate and very similar to past nominations, and I have got some examples of that. But if I may—and I know we have been here—and Lord knows this guy has been through the wringer—I just want to comment a little bit about an unhealthy area I think we find ourselves in, in the last hour. Most of us are lawyers, and I would hate to be judged by the people I have represented in the past, totally. I have represented some people that are not very nice. But I gave them my all. I have represented people on Air Force bases that were so unpopular, Judge Roberts, that no one would eat with me, because it was my job as the area defense counsel to represent that person. Your heart. Nobody can question your intellect because it would be a question of their intellect to question yours. [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. So we are down to the heart. And is it all coming down to that? Well, there are all kinds of hearts. There are

bleeding hearts, and there are hard hearts. And if I wanted to judge Justice Ginsburg on her heart, I might take a hard-hearted view of her and say she is a bleeding heart. She represents the ACLU. She wants the age of consent to be 12. She believes there is a constitutional right to prostitution. What kind of heart is that? Well, she has a different value system than I do, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have a good heart. And I want this Committee to understand that if we go down this road of putting people’s hearts in play, and the only way you can have a good heart is adopt my value system, we are doing a great disservice to the judiciary.
Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Graham. We are now going to go into executive session under Senate Rule XXVI to review the FBI report, which is standard for all judicial nominees, Supreme Court or court or appeals or district court, and to consider any other investigative issue that members of the Committee may have. During Senator Biden’s tenure as Chairman, the practice was initiated of conducting routine closed sessions with each nominee for the Supreme Court to ask the nominee on the record under oath about all investigative charges against the person if there were any. These hearings are routinely conducted for every Supreme Court nominee, even where there are no investigative issues to be resolved. In so doing, those outside the Committee cannot infer that the Committee has received adverse confidential information about a nominee. The Committee and Judge Roberts will now proceed to Dirksen 226, which is right down the hall— Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I understand, also following our practice, the Republican counsel and the Democratic counsel, who normally work together on such issues, will brief the Committee. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Leahy, that is correct. Senator LEAHY. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. We expect to return to hear our first outside witness, the American Bar Association, just as soon as we conclude this. We want to move ahead as promptly as we can, so those witnesses should be available, and we will now adjourn to 226 in this building. [Whereupon, at 11:07 a.m., the Committee proceeded to executive session.] [Whereupon, at 11:38 a.m., the Committee reconvened in open session.] Chairman SPECTER. The Committee went into executive session and reviewed the background investigations on Judge Roberts, which were routine. Senator Leahy and I have been delegated to report that there are no disqualifying factors. We had Judge Roberts in for a very short discussion and we returned to the hearing room to move ahead with our hearing. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. I concur with that. The practice of this was begun with the prior Chairman. I think it is good to have it as a routine. We do this through the Supreme Court nominees we meet, go over the background. I agree with the Chairman, there was

nothing in the background of a disqualifying nature and it was pretty routine. I mention this because I don’t want anybody to read more into what is just, if anything, a housekeeping chore in this case.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. We have six panels of witnesses, a total of 31 witnesses. It is our hope and expectation that we can conclude our work today. And while Senators have rights to question, we customarily have a 5minute rule. To the extent that we can move ahead promptly, it would be appreciated. We start first with the American Bar Association. The Chairman of the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary is Mr. Steve Tober, undergraduate and law degrees from Syracuse University, law review, deeply involved in the New Hampshire and New England legal communities, former Chairman of the Committee to Redraft New Hampshire’s Rules of Professional Conduct. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Tober, and thank you for your service. And now we look forward to your testimony. All witnesses will be limited to 5 minutes, which is standard under our rules.
STATEMENT OF STEPHEN L. TOBER, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE; ACCOMPANIED BY THOMAS Z. HAYWARD, PAST-CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS; AND PAMELA A. BRESNAHAN, D.C. CIRCUIT REPRESENTATIVE, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. TOBER. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, my name is Stephen L. Tober, of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and it is indeed my privilege to chair the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. I am joined by Thomas E. Hayward, Jr., of Chicago, sitting to my right, my immediate predecessor, and by Pamela Bresnahan, who was the 2004–2005 District of Columbia Circuit member, also of the 2004–2005 committee. For more than 50 years, the ABA Standing Committee has provided a unique and comprehensive examination of the professional qualifications of candidates for the Federal bench. It is comprised of 15 distinguished lawyers who represent every judicial circuit in the United States and who individually volunteer hundreds of hours in public service to our profession. This Committee conducts a thorough, non-partisan, non-ideological peer review, and it does so by using long-established standards that measure the nominees’ integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament. In the sense that a major portion of the investigation consists of scores and scores of interviews with judges and lawyers, it is very much the voice of the bench and bar of this Nation. Over the course of its history, the ABA Committee has never proposed a candidate of its own, nor do we do so now. Its function, rather, is to receive the name of each nominee, investigate and evaluate the professional qualifications of each nominee, and then vote. While factors used in considering lower Federal court nomina-

452
tions obtain here as well, the committee’s investigation of a nominee for the United States Supreme Court is further based on the premise that such an individual must possess exceptional professional qualifications. The significance, range, and complexity of issues that such a nominee will face on that Court demands no less.
As a result, our approach to a Supreme Court nomination has two procedural differences. First, all circuit members of the Committee conduct confidential interviews within their circuits; and second, the Committee works with at least two reading groups composed of a team of academicians and a team of practitioners who analyze the nominee’s writings in detail and report their findings to the full committee.
After the comprehensive investigation is completed and assembled, each member of the Standing Committee reviews the report thoroughly and individually evaluates the nominee, using three rating categories: well-qualified, qualified, and not qualified. Needless to say, to merit an evaluation of well-qualified, the nominee must possess legal ability, experience, and reputation of the highest standing.
With respect to Judge Roberts’s nominations to the Supreme Court, the Standing Committee has rated him twice. When he was first nominated by the President to be Associate Justice, on July 29th, the 2004–2005 committee, chaired by Tom Hayward, undertook a complete evaluation and measured the nominee’s integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament. That evaluation included interviews with more than 300 judges, lawyers, and community members throughout the Nation; a review of his decisions and selected substantive memoranda from the National Archives by both our reading groups and individual circuit members; and an in-person detailed interview with Judge Roberts. Based upon that evaluation, the 2004–2005 Committee found that Judge Roberts was unanimously well-qualified to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
When the President thereafter nominated Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice, on September 6th, the 2005–2006 committee, which took office in mid-August with seven new members, performed a supplemental evaluation. That supplemental effort was focused solely upon the nominee’s qualifications to perform the administrative and leadership skills incumbent upon the Office of Chief Justice of the United States. This new Committee had, essentially, a handful of days to perform that supplemental evaluation. Nonetheless, that supplemental effort included interviews with well over 80 judges, lawyers, and community members; a review of the materials gathered in the original report; and an in-person interview with Judge Roberts. Based upon that supplemental evaluation, and even with the change in membership, Judge Roberts was found by the 2005–2006 Standing Committee to be unanimously well-qualified to perform the administrative and leadership responsibilities required of the Chief Justice of the United States.
These two ratings, when considered together and in conjunction with the accompanying letter to your Committee, which we ask to be made part of this record, provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with a comprehensive, independent peer review.

Allow me to summarize: The ABA Standing Committee is fully satisfied that Judge Roberts meets the highest standards required for service as Chief Justice of the United States. He has the admiration and respect of his colleagues on and off the bench. And he is, as we have found, the very definition of collegial.
Mr. Chairman, the goal of the ABA Standing Committee has always been and remains in concert with the goal of your Committee, to assure a qualified and independent judiciary for the American people.
Thank you for the opportunity to appear here. We are more than happy to entertain any questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Tober appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Tober, for your testimony. Thank you, Ms. Bresnahan, for your contribution; Mr. Hayward, for your contribution. We thank the ABA for your hard work and a very comprehensive report. Obviously a great deal of effort has gone into it, with the very extensive interviews which you have conducted.
Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. They are probably going to feel left out and disappointed if we don’t grill the three of them the way we grilled Judge Roberts the last few days. Ms. BRESNAHAN. I don’t think so. Senator LEAHY. But on their behalf, I am willing to waive that. Mr. TOBER. We will take that risk, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. A vote has just begun. I think we can move ahead into the next panel unless any of the members have any questions which are important to be asked. Senator Biden? Senator BIDEN. I just want to reiterate, we know how much work this entailed. I mean, it was an incredible amount of work. And truly, we thank you. There have been debates in this Committee in the past about the relevance and importance of the ABA recommendation. I think it is important, what you do; I think we all do now. And I want to thank you. It is a whole lot of work. And thank you, Steve, for your efforts. Mr. TOBER. Thank you, sir. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. Let me just second that. I have certainly appreciated over the years the good work you are doing. I have to say that over the last number of years it has just been exemplary in every way. I just want you all to know that, and we appreciate it. We know all the effort and especially, Ms. Bresnahan, the effort that you have put in on a number of the judges that have come up in this area. You have worked your heart out, and I have to say I want to compliment. Ms. BRESNAHAN. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to thank these members for their work and would just point out that, in the course of making these evaluations, you talked to the judges, lawyers on both sides, against whom they litigated. You know from your own personal experience normally who will give a fair and

454
honest evaluation and place good judgment on a person’s professional skills. So I do think it provides a lot of advantages for our Committee, and I salute that.
Secondly, let me ask if one of you would comment just as a professional lawyer who has been involved in the practice for many years—how do you feel about the tendency that sometimes occurs to judge a lawyer by their client rather than how they perform honorably and effectively in court? Would you share your thoughts about that subject?
Mr. TOBER. I guess what I would say, Senator, is that a lawyer is an advocate in the first instance and an officer of the court as well. And the roles are distinct, well-defined. And if we only defended those that didn’t need our help, we wouldn’t be doing very much for the American people.
The role of a judge is very different. By definition, that person should know nothing about the case coming before them, should have no judgment about the parties either way, and must be fundamentally fair at the end of the day so that litigants and lawyers feel they’ve been treated properly in our system. The only thing, Senator, that keeps our buildings of justice standing is the respect of the American people, and that is the product that comes out of that building from judges.
Senator SESSIONS. And you would have some concern that if a judge judged lawyers by their clients and didn’t give them the full fair hearing in court, I guess you would say.
Mr. HAYWARD. That is true, Senator, and I adopt the comments of Steve Tober. And I would even add to that. You should not judge it by who the lawyer represents because the lawyer, as you have heard over the last several days, is there as an advocate.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Senator LEAHY. I didn’t want by my saying there would be no questions to suggest that we don’t have appreciation. I have been Chairman of this Committee as have several others here, and we do know the work, we do know a number of instances where you have gone back and followed up on things. It is not easy. I should note for the people who are watching this, you don’t get paid for doing this. Mr. TOBER. That is correct, sir. Senator LEAHY. In fact, we couldn’t begin to afford it, with the fees of some of you, if you did. You do this pro bono. It is a tremendous service to the Senate, but it also a tremendous service to the bar overall, and I thank you for it. Mr. HAYWARD. Thank you, Senator. Mr. TOBER. Thank you, Senator. Ms. BRESNAHAN. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. It is a high compliment to have no questions, or few questions. Senator SESSIONS. Could I ask one more? Senator LEAHY. We are diminishing the compliment now. Senator SESSIONS. With regard to the lawyers and judges and others you interview, isn’t it true that sometimes they are more willing to confide in you if they have a problem that they might share with someone else?

Mr. TOBER. I believe that is true, Senator. Tom served 6 years before being Chair. I served three as a member. Pam has been on for three. We all have had experience in talking to judges, to lawyers, to other community members who feel very comfortable understanding that what they tell us remains in the strictest of confidence, and we are able to do a true peer review because of that. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to explain that. We do get information of the most important kind from the process that we engage in.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Tober, Ms. Bresnahan, and Mr. Hayward. Thank you.
Mr. TOBER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. HAYWARD. Thank you, Senator. Ms. BRESNAHAN. Thank you. Senator SESSIONS. I think that makes that report particularly valuable, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. I agree with you, Senator Sessions. We will now call on our second panel, Governor Thornburgh, Congressman Lewis, Commissioner Braceras, Mr. Wade Henderson, Commissioner Kirsanow, and Judge Jones. While the panel is being seated, just a word of explanation. There is a vote in process, but there is a second vote behind that so that when we break to vote, it is most efficient to vote a second time before returning. But we never know exactly when the first vote is going to end, so our time is best economized if we arrive there about 20 minutes after the vote has started so that we can return as promptly as possible. Our first witness is the distinguished former Governor of Pennsylvania, Governor Dick Thornburgh, elected in 1978 and reelected in 1982, Attorney General for both President Reagan and President George H.W. Bush, Under Secretary General for Administration and Management of the United Nations, currently counsel for the international law firm of Kirkpatrick and Lockhart and a longstanding friend of mine. It began in 1966 when I campaigned with him in Squirrel Hill when he ran for the Congress of the United States. Governor Thornburgh, thank you for joining us.
STATEMENT OF HON. DICK THORNBURGH, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, FORMER GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND COUNSEL, KIRKPATRICK AND LOCKHART NICHOLSON GRAHAM, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. THORNBURGH. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Specter, other distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee. It is my distinct honor and privilege to be here today in full support of Judge John G. Roberts’s nomination to be the 17th Chief Justice of the United States.
I have known Judge Roberts as a friend and colleague for over 15 years and can attest to his outstanding personal characteristics and undoubted integrity. Perhaps more important for present purposes, Judge Roberts’s extraordinary legal skills and keen intellect are undisputed.
Before his Senate confirmation by unanimous consent over 2 years ago to be a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, he

was heralded by leading Democrats and Republicans alike as one of the very best and most highly respected appellate lawyers in the nation with a deserved reputation as a brilliant writer and oral advocate. He is also a wonderful professional colleague, both because of his enormous skills and because of his unquestioned integrity and fair mindedness, that from his peers at the D.C. Bar.
I can echo this fanfare because of the deep and lasting respect I have for Judge Roberts’s legal abilities that I saw firsthand when he served as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General while I was Attorney General under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush. In that capacity, Judge Roberts represented the U.S. Government in all manner of cases before the Supreme Court, where he was charged to defend, among other things, legal attacks on the constitutionality of Acts of Congress. John represented the Government in 39 cases before the Supreme Court while in the Solicitor General’s Office.
He is a truly remarkable lawyer—bright, witty, capable, respectful, and creative. I had the good sense to enlist him as my coach for my final appearance before the Supreme Court myself in 1991 and we won the case.
On the Court of Appeals for the last 2 years, Judge Roberts has demonstrated in practice the principles he has articulated as a young attorney working at the Department of Justice.
Reflecting on the role of judicial restraint as a guiding standard for how courts should approach the judicial decisionmaking process, Judge Roberts explained in the materials he drafted for then-Attorney General William French Smith, and I quote, ‘‘The phrase ‘judicial restraint’ may mean many things to many people, but at its core, it is a notion that Federal courts must scrupulously avoid engaging in policy making, which is committed under our system of government to the popularly elected and accountable branches of the States.’’
‘‘Judicial activism,’’ Judge Roberts stated, ‘‘is neither conservative nor liberal.’’ He recognized that throughout history and to this day, both liberal and conservative interests have sought to enlist an activist judiciary in the achievement of goals which were not attainable through normal political processes. Today, different groups urge judges to substitute their own policy choices for those of Federal and State legislatures, but the evils of judicial activism remain the same regardless of the political ends the activism seeks to serve. So said Judge Roberts.
Indeed, he sagely recognized that the greatest threat to judicial independence occurs when the courts flout the basis of their independence by exceeding their constitutionally limited role and engage in policy making.
Let me highlight just one of Judge Roberts’s D.C. Circuit opinions, which clearly reflects the correctness of his approach that cases should be decided upon the text of the statute, the Constitution, and the particular facts before the court. I know that most members of this Committee are familiar with this case, which has been nicknamed the ‘‘french fry case.’’
The facts are straightforward. The D.C. City Code made it illegal to eat or drink in a Metro station and the local transit authority imposed a zero-tolerance policy for violation, since it had received

complaints about bad behavior in certain Metro stations. A 12year-old girl who stopped at a fast-food restaurant on the way home from school made the mistake of eating a french fry while waiting for her friend to purchase a farecard. She was arrested and hauled off to jail for booking, and ultimately, some three hours later, delivered to the custody of her parents.
Was this bad policy? Yes. In fact, after the publicity surrounding the case, the City Council adopted a new rule whereby they would merely issue citations to juvenile offenders rather than arresting them. Was the policy unconstitutional? Both the District Court judge and the unanimous panel of the D.C. Circuit agreed that it was not because age, or more specifically youth, is not a suspect classification under the Constitution or any Act of Congress and because probable cause existed to support the arrest, since she did, in fact, eat the french fry in violation of the city’s zero-tolerance policy.
Why discuss such a seemingly silly case? I think that in the opening paragraph of the decision, which I will quote, Judge Roberts forcefully establishes his understanding of the court’s limited role while at the same time expressing hope that the policy is changed at the appropriate level.
He said, ‘‘No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation. A 12-year-old girl was arrested, searched, and handcuffed. Her shoelaces were removed and she was transported in a windowless rear compartment of a police vehicle to a juvenile processing center, where she was booked, fingerprinted, and detained until released to her mother some three hours later, all for eating a single french fry in a Metrorail station. The child was frightened, embarrassed, and crying throughout her ordeal. The District Court described the policies that led to her arrest as foolish, and indeed, the policies were changed after those responsible endured the sort of publicity reserved for adults who make young girls cry. The question before us, however, is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. Like the District Court, we conclude that they did not.’’
Judge Roberts has also stated repeatedly his belief that cases should be decided on the merits, not on the basis of a judge’s personal opinion. As he expressed as recently as this past July in United States v. Jackson, sentiments do not decide cases. Facts and the law do. Understanding that most basic principle highlights the significant difference that exists between a lawyer acting as an advocate on behalf of a client and the role of a judge charged with deciding cases fairly and objectively.
But all too often in the soundbites that attach to reviews of Judge Roberts’s record, one group or another will state that Judge Roberts doesn’t support, for example, the rights of criminal defendants, environmental enactments, or the civil rights laws, or most egregiously, that Judge Roberts condoned the bombing of women’s clinics. The supposed bases for these claims is gleaned, interpreted, and misconstrued by these critics from their interpretation of arguments that Judge Roberts made as a lawyer, both in private practice and for the Government.

The distinguished members of this Committee can easily see through this argument, for we all know and appreciate that lawyers are duty-bound to be zealous advocates for their clients. Cases argued by Judge Roberts as a Government lawyer or a lawyer in private practice, in my opinion, say little about how Judge Roberts as a Supreme Court Justice will approach cases, other than as he has all his professional life. He approaches matters with great skill, dedication, and earnestness.
It is Judge Roberts’s record as a jurist that is most impressive and most persuasive. It is a record that speaks of a judge who understands the role of the judiciary, who approaches each case independently and objectively, who respects history and precedent, who interprets the law based on the facts before him, who does not engage in judicial policymaking, and who will make this country proud as the next Chief Justice of the United States.
I sincerely appreciate the Committee’s invitation to speak today and the Committee’s careful and deliberate consideration of Judge Roberts’s nomination. He is, in my view, an exemplar of what we should seek in our next Chief Justice. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Thornburgh appears as a submission for the record.]

Congressman Lewis is voting at the moment. Do we know how much time is left on the vote? Well, the time has expired, so we are going to go vote and we will return just as soon as we can. The Committee stands in brief recess. [Recess 12:03 p.m. to 12:31 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume. Our next witness is Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, an architect of the historic march on Washington in August of 1963; has been the Representative for Georgia’s Fifth Congressional District since November of 1986 when he was elected, took office in January; a B.A. in religion and philosophy from Fisk University, graduate of American Baptist Theological Seminary. Thank you for crossing the Rotunda today, Congressman Lewis, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN LEWIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA
Representative LEWIS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Committee, I am honored to be here today. As many of you know, this is not the first time I have come before this Committee. I was here 14 years ago when the nomination of another Justice to the Supreme Court moved me to speak out. I am here today with the hope that this Committee will hear my words and take heed. When I was growing up in rural Alabama I saw those signs that said ‘‘White Men, Colored Men,’’ ‘‘White Women, Colored Women.’’ I used to ask my parents and my grandparents, ‘‘Why racism? Why racial discrimination? ’’ And they would tell me, ‘‘Don’t get in trouble. Don’t get in the way.’’ As a participant in the civil rights movement of the 1960’s I decided to get in the way. I was beaten, arrested and jailed more

than 40 times for peaceful, nonviolent protests against legalized segregation in the South.
During that time I saw American citizens with their head cracked open by nightsticks lying in the streets, weeping from tear gas, trampled by horses and attacked by police dogs, calling helplessly for medical aid.
Back then, legalized discrimination was enforced by State and local officials. The Federal Government was our only hope, and we depended on the Supreme Court to act as referee in the struggle for justice and civil rights.
I remember on one occasion when the Court issued a decision on public transportation, and a elderly black woman was overheard to say, ‘‘God Almighty has spoken from Washington.’’
In 1965, Jurist Roberts was only 10-years-old. He may be a brilliant lawyer, but I wonder whether he can really understand the depth of what it took to get the Voting Rights Act passed. The right to vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society.
As many of you know, I gave a little blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, but some of my friends and colleagues gave all they had, their very lives for the right to vote. People stood day after day in unmovable lines to pass their so-called literacy tests. They had to interpret certain sections of the Constitution, count jelly beans in a jar or the number of bubbles in a bar of soap to register to vote.
I feel that if Judge Roberts is confirmed to be the Chief Justice of the United States, the Supreme Court would no longer hear the people’s cries for justice. I feel that the leadership of the Court will promote politics over the protection of individual rights and liberties. If the Federal Courts had abandoned us in the civil rights movement in the name of judicial restraint, we might still be struggling with the burden of legal segregation in America today.
Jurist Roberts’s memos reveal him to be hostile towards civil rights, affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act. He has even said that Voting Rights Act violations, and I quote, ‘‘should not be made too easy to prove.’’ Under the Court’s decision in Mobile v. Bolden, the Court weakened the Voting Rights Act. Under this ruling many political subdivisions would have been permitted to maintain at large election systems, diluting minority voting strength. This may be less obvious than the violence and intimidation of 1965, but it is no less harmful to our Nation’s principles of inclusive democracy.
Section 2 has been successful in reducing barriers, and has increased the number of minority elected officials. There is no doubt, Mr. Chairman, in my mind, that had Judge Roberts’s narrow reading of the Voting Rights Act prevailed, fewer people of color would be serving in Congress and at both the State and local level today.
As our Nation is still reeling from Hurricane Katrina, the timing of these hearings could not be more significant. What happened in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana exposed the issue of race, class and fairness yet again. We are still a Nation deeply divided by race and class.

ities, all of us need equal access to a fair and independent judiciary to assure equal justice under the law.
The stakes are higher than ever. We cannot afford to elevate an individual to such a powerful lifetime position whose record demonstrates such a strong desire to reverse the hard-won civil rights gains that so many of us sacrificed so much to achieve. We have come a great distance. We cannot afford to stand still. We cannot afford to go back. We must go forward to the creation of one America.
My friends, Members of the Senate, I implore you to get in the way.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Representative Lewis appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Congressman Lewis for those very passionate remarks. Our next witness is Commissioner Jennifer Braceras, U.S. Commission for Civil Rights; taught at the Suffolk Law School as a Visiting Fellow at the Independent Women’s Forum; in the year 2000, Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly rated her as one of the State’s top ten lawyers of the year. Practiced law with the Boston firm of Ropes & Gray. Thank you for joining us, Commissioner Braceras, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF JENNIFER CABRANES BRACERAS, ESQ., COMMISSIONER, U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND VISITING FELLOW AT THE INDEPENDENT WOMEN’S FORUM, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS
Ms. BRACERAS. Thank you. Chairman Specter, Senator Leahy, members of the Committee, my name is Jennifer Braceras. I am a resident of Massachusetts and a member of the Massachusetts Bar and the Hispanic National Bar Association. I am, as you said, a Visiting Fellow with the Independent Women’s Forum, and I am privileged to serve by appointment of the President as a Commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights. I am honored to be here today to support the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. Although I do not know Judge Roberts personally, I am generally familiar with his background and record. His distinguished career and his testimony before this Committee make clear to even the most casual observer that Judge Roberts is eminently well qualified for the post. Despite these obvious qualifications, however, opponents of Judge Roberts criticize his record on a variety of matters that loosely fall under the umbrella of civil rights. These critics allege that Judge Roberts’s confirmation to be Chief Justice will somehow be harmful to women and minorities. These charges are at best misplaced, and at worst deliberately misleading attacks that would have been leveled against anyone nominated by this President. There are at least five reasons why such criticisms are without merit. First, many of the specific criticisms of Judge Roberts’s record involve positions he advocated as a lawyer in the adminis-
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00472 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

trations of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Some of the subjects that have elicited criticism by interest groups include school busing, racial quotas, the revision of the Voting Rights legislation to seek equal electoral results as opposed to equal access, and the theory of comparable worth.
Published reports indicate that the positions taken by Judge Roberts in this capacity as a lawyer for the Reagan and Bush administrations are broadly consistent with the views of the American people and fully within the political mainstream. But even if they were not, the arguments expressed by Judge Roberts as a young man decades ago are arguments on behalf of the administrations for which he worked, not the views of a neutral umpire asked to rule on particular legislation.
Judge Roberts’s view of the judicial function does not contemplate the imposition of his own policy preferences from the bench. His commitment to judicial restraint should give Americans of all political viewpoints great comfort.
Second, it is clear from the public record that Judge Roberts supports the vigorous enforcement of our Nation’s anti-discrimination laws. In his executive branch memos Judge Roberts repeatedly defended the ‘‘bedrock principle of treating people on the basis of merit without regard to race or sex.’’ And he argued numerous times for the executive branch to prosecute claims of unequal treatment to the fullest extent of the law.
Third, as an advocate, Judge Roberts has been on both sides of controversial civil rights questions. This broad experience should give the American people faith in Judge Roberts’s ability to understand the complexity of controversial issues.
Fourth, it is clear that Judge Roberts has a strong commitment to equal opportunity and to the anti-discrimination principle embodied in the 14th Amendment and codified in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He has written—and I quote—‘‘Before the law, we do not stand as black or white, Gentile or Jew, Hispanic or Anglo, but only as Americans entitled to equal justice.’’
Certainly there is nothing extreme or unusual about this field. To the contrary, it embodies the American ideal. It reflects the aspirations of the 14th Amendment which were given life by the Court in Brown v. Board of Education and by the framers of the 1964 Act.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, irresponsible rhetoric that a Court led by Judge Roberts would be hostile to civil rights misinterprets the role of the Court in our democracy. This rhetoric is based on several deeply flawed premises. First, such rhetoric presumes that it is the job of the Court to create new rights in response to evolving circumstances. It is not. Our Constitution guarantees certain basic rights which the courts must, of course, enforce. Legislatures, both State and Federal, may expand upon those rights or create new ones, provided that they act within the scope of their constitutional authority. If citizens are in any way dissatisfied with the scope or reach of current law, it is to their democratically elected representatives, not the courts, that they must turn.
Second, Judge Roberts’s critics erroneously presume the Court should interpret all statutory language expansively. That is also not their role. Their role is to apply statutes as written.

Chairman SPECTER. Commissioner Braceras, could you summarize the balance of your statement, please?
Ms. BRACERAS. Sure. Chairman SPECTER. Your full statement will be made a part of the record, as will all statements. Ms. BRACERAS. The Supreme Court is neither the first nor the last word on civil rights, or any other issue, for that matter. Each of the three branches of Government has a role to play, and Judge Roberts respects and understands these distinct roles. In conclusion, I submit that Judge Roberts’s critics have it wrong. Judge Roberts’s commitments to the vigorous enforcement of our Nation’s civil rights laws and to the bedrock principles of judicial restraint, judicial review, and equal opportunity will make him a Justice of whom all Americans can be proud. And I urge you to confirm him as the next Chief Justice of the United States. [The prepared statement of Ms. Braceras appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Commissioner Braceras. Senator Leahy has asked for recognition before we complete the panel. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A classmate of mine from law school, John Dean, was supposed to testify, but when we changed the schedule this week he was unable to join us. I just want to make sure his testimony is put in the record at the appropriate place. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made part of the record. Our next witness is Mr. Wade Henderson, who is the Director of the Leadership Conference, a longstanding leader on civil rights. Before his current position, he was Washington Bureau Director of the NAACP, serves as the Rauh Professor of Public Interest Law at the Clarke School of Law, a graduate of Howard University and the Rutgers University School of Law. I know you talked to David Brog about a postponement of the hearing, and then events overtook us, and postponement did take place. Thank you for joining us today, Mr. Henderson, and the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF WADE HENDERSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. HENDERSON. Well, good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesies in giving us an additional week because of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
Again, my name is Wade Henderson, and I am the Executive Director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. The Leadership Conference is the Nation’s premier civil and human rights coalition and has coordinated the national legislative campaigns on behalf of every major civil rights law since 1957. The Leadership Conference’s 190 member organizations represent persons of color, women, children, organized labor, individuals with disabilities, older Americans, major religious groups, gays and lesbians, and civil liberties and human rights groups. It is a privilege to rep-

resent the civil rights community in addressing the Committee today.
Based on reasons I will highlight here today, discussed at greater length in my written testimony, and after a careful review of John Roberts’s available record, including his testimony before this Committee, the Leadership Conference is compelled to oppose his confirmation to the position of Chief Justice of the United States.
In the last several days of testimony, Judge Roberts has failed to distance himself from the anti-civil rights positions he has advocated. We have heard nothing demonstrating his commitment to ensuring that the Federal Government will continue to play a strong role in protecting civil and human rights of all Americans. To the contrary, all evidence indicates that Judge Roberts would use his undeniably impressive legal skills to bring us back to a country that most of us wouldn’t recognize, where States’ rights trump civil rights, where the Federal courts or Congress can see discrimination but are powerless to remedy it. This is not the America in which most Americans want to live.
As we have seen over the past 2 weeks in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, when the Federal Government’s role is diminished, the least among us suffer most. Our Nation fought a Civil War over the meaning of equality in our Constitution and the role of the Federal Government in ensuring that equality, and then engaged in a great debate about the power of the Federal Government to enforce the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. Reconstruction failed, and African-Americans were returned to a position of near servitude because those who advocated for weak Federal power won.
It wasn’t until decades later when the Court outlawed Statesponsored segregation in Brown v. Board of Education, followed by the enactment of a series of civil rights statutes by Congress in the 1960’s that are now the bedrock of our national commitment to equality of opportunity, that the Federal Government stepped in as a champion of equal justice under law.
However, in recent years, we have seen the rise of a political movement that is an eerie parallel to the post-Reconstruction period. Today, there are those who in the name of judicial restraint advocate for a Federal retreat in the area of civil rights. While our Constitution speaks of fundamental rights, some oppose the Federal courts or Congress using the Constitution to protect individuals against violations of those rights. John Roberts has written that Federal courts should not be empowered to invalidate ‘‘widely accepted State practices,’’ even if such practices prevent AfricanAmericans and others from having equal opportunity in voting. If his view had prevailed, our country’s voting rights revolution would never have happened.
Would Judge Roberts have approved of poll taxes or literacy tests because those were ‘‘widely accepted practices’’? Despite the strong recommendation from a very conservative member of the Reagan administration’s civil rights team, John Roberts advised against intervention in a sex discrimination case against the Kentucky prison system, contending that discriminatory treatment of men and women in the prison’s vocational program was ‘‘reasonable in light of tight prison budgets.’’

464
Would Judge Roberts then apply the same argument to equal educational opportunities for women generally? Could States in the name of saving money refuse to provide equal health services to men and women? In John Roberts’s view, Congress could exclude all school desegregation cases from the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. This is, in effect, a pre-Brown vision that fits squarely into the objective of preventing the Federal courts from fulfilling the promise of the 14th Amendment.
As many commentators have made clear, John Roberts is a gifted and intelligent lawyer and advocate, but that is not the test for determining whether he is fit to lead the highest Court in the land. Rather, the test is whether John Roberts has demonstrated he has committed to the fundamental principles on which our country was founded and whether his vision of America matches the expectations of mainstream Americans. John Roberts has failed this test. Therefore, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has no choice but to oppose his confirmation. America can and should do better.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Henderson appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Henderson. Our next witness is Commissioner Peter Kirsanow of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, had been labor counsel for the City of Cleveland; he is the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Center for New Black Leadership, on the Advisory Board of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a graduate of Cornell, a law degree from Cleveland State with honors. Thank you for coming in today, Commissioner, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF PETER KIRSANOW, PARTNER, BENESCH, FRIEDLANDER, COPLAY & ARONOFF, AND COMMISSIONER, U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS, CLEVELAND, OHIO
Mr. KIRSANOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, members of the Committee. I am Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and a partner in the Cleveland, Ohio, law firm of Benesch, Friedlander, Coplay & Aronoff, in the labor and employment practice. I am here in my personal capacity.
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was established in 1957 to, among other things, act as a national clearing house for information related to denials of equal protection and discrimination, and in furtherance of that function, my assistant and I reviewed the opinions of Judge Roberts while on the D.C. Circuit related to civil rights and also his Supreme Court advocacy related to civil rights, particularly with respect to prevailing civil rights norms, jurisprudential norms, with particular attention to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment.
Our examination reveals that Judge Roberts’s approach to civil rights is consistent with mainstream textual interpretation of the relevant constitutional and statutory authority and governing precedent. His opinions evince appreciable degrees of judicial restraint, modesty, and discipline and, in short, Judge Roberts’s approach to civil rights is exemplary. It is legally sound, intellectually

465
honest, and with a deep appreciation for the historical bases for civil rights laws.
Our examination also reveals that several aspects of Judge Roberts’s civil rights record have been mischaracterized and sometimes the criticisms have been sorely misplaced, for example, conflating his counsel and advocacy on the part of clients with his own personal policy preferences. Just three brief examples.
First, some have contended that during the 1982 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, Judge Roberts had adopted an anti-civil rights approach to the interpretation of the Act. But the record definitively shows that Judge Roberts had consistently counseled in favor of reauthorization of the entire Act as is, and he expressed the administration’s concern that a substantive redefinition of Section 2 could risk introducing confusion and uncertainty into what had already been considered one of the Nation’s most successful pieces of civil rights legislation. Judge Roberts continued to advocate on behalf of his client for vigorous enforcement of Section 2 even after adoption of the effects test.
Second, some have claimed that Judge Roberts’s position on affirmative action is regressive. Most of these criticisms relate to his questioning of a 1981 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report pertaining to affirmative action. A detailed examination of that report shows that not only was Judge Roberts’s criticism correct but imperative. The Commission’s report was inconsistent with the status of the law in 1981, when issued, and fails to comport with the postAdarand Construction v. Pena, Grutter v. Bollinger affirmative action norms of today. Judge Roberts had properly advised against unlawful racial quotas and set-asides untethered to a proof of discrimination. He supported the—and we heard it earlier—‘‘bedrock principle of treating people on the basis of merit without regard to race or sex.’’
A third contention unsupported by examination is that Judge Roberts’s arguments before the Supreme Court in civil rights matters were somehow extreme or out of the mainstream. Probabilities would dictate that if Judge Roberts had somehow slipped past the Supreme Court’s gatekeepers and got to make extremist arguments before the Court, the Court would have dismissed virtually 100 percent of those arguments or, at a bare minimum, far more than 50 percent, which is the fate of most arguments before the Court. Again, a review of the record shows that Judge Roberts’s arguments with respect to civil rights were agreed to by the Supreme Court 71 percent of the time—hardly indicative of positions outside of prevailing civil rights norms. And these Justices who agreed with him included those who might colloquially be described as conservative, such as Justice Rehnquist, who agreed with him 75 percent of the time, or Justices Scalia and Thomas, each of whom agreed with him 71 percent of the time. But they also include Justices colloquially described as liberal, such as Justice Ginsburg, who agreed with him 60 percent of the time; Justice Souter, 59 percent of the time; Justice Stevens, 59 percent of the time; and even Justice Thurgood Marshall, the premier civil rights litigator, probably forever, agreed with his advocacy position 67 percent of the time, almost as much as Justices Scalia and Thomas, and more than Justice O’Connor.

Mr. Chairman, it is respectfully submitted that Judge Roberts’s 25-year record with respect to matters pertaining to civil rights demonstrates an unwavering commitment to equal protection and a comprehensive understanding of our civil rights laws that would make him an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court, particularly in the capacity of Chief Justice.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kirsanow appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Our next witness and final witness on this panel is Judge Nathaniel Jones, who served as Executive Director of the Fair Employment Practice Commission, was an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, directed NAACP litigation as general counsel for 10 years, a graduate of Youngstown State University, both Bachelor’s and law degrees and served on the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and is now retired. Judge Jones, thank you for coming in today and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF NATHANIEL JONES, RETIRED JUDGE, U.S. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS TO THE SIXTH CIRCUIT, OF COUNSEL, BLANK ROME LLP, CINCINNATI, OHIO
Judge JONES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy and esteemed members of the Committee. I am honored to have this opportunity to appear as a witness today to, I hope, assist you to more effectively evaluate the fitness of John G. Roberts to be confirmed as Chief Justice of the United States by providing a historical perspective.
Mr. Chairman, I ask that my full statement be entered into the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, Judge Jones, it will be a part of the record.
Judge JONES. Thank you. My acceptance of your invitation to offer testimony was prompted by my conscience and is driven by a profound obligation to introduce into the record a historical perspective, and in doing so, I join with my colleague, John Lewis, whose life is a personification of courage and I wish to add to his description of the struggle for civil remedies and civil rights remedies.
You are confronted here, I suggest, with a serious constitutional and moral responsibility. You are considering under the Constitution’s Advice and Consent Clause the fitness of a Supreme Court nominee who has in the past argued against the use of Federal power to eradicate the vestiges of slavery and the badges of servitude. This record triggers serious questions and a vigorous inquiry into the whys.
So much of the nominee’s advocacy as a Government lawyer and counselor was in the direction of against the implementation of civil rights remedies. There has been a lack of balance.
While I appear in my own right, more importantly, I am invoking the voices of distinguished legal giants whose voices have been stilled by time: Dean Charles Hamilton Houston, Justice Thurgood Marshall, Judge William H. Hastie, Clarence Mitchell, James A.

Nabrit, Judge Spottswood Robinson, Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, and many others who have my, and I trust your, deep and enduring respect.
These individuals believed in the Constitution and they hoped that government would step up and protect the rights of the minorities and the persons who were victims of majoritarian excesses. They fashioned a strategy for using the law and the courts to attack racial segregation. They set the stage for the development of remedies to remove the stain of racial segregation that law and the courts imposed upon this land.
You may ask why I invoke their names and speak in the voice of these towering legal giants and hold up the contributions they made to advancing civil rights jurisprudence. My reason is twofold. First, my professional and personal experiences qualify me to do so. Second, since he was nominated by the President, serious questions have been raised concerning Judge Roberts’s views about the relevance and legality of remedies aimed at ending racial discrimination.
Unfortunately, few Americans know or have focused on or are familiar with the history of the myriad ways the posit of law and legislatures and courts reinforced and perpetuated racial discrimination in America. It is up to this Committee, therefore, to assure that, at the very least, the next Chief Justice of the United States understands that history and, most importantly, why remedial action was and continues to be necessary. Those courageous souls who laid the foundation for overturning decades of legally enforced racial segregation are calling out to you, and I echo their voices, to respect their labors and heed their lessons.
One’s fitness to be the Chief Justice transcends stellar academic achievements and acknowledged professional competence. The nominee’s views and his documented activist attempts to thwart the Federal court’s efforts to dismantle segregation schemes that the courts themselves permitted to be erected and sustained bring into play something much more fundamental than technical skills. The critical question before you is one of values, not competence.
To understand why this is true, one need to only consider the most wretched decision the Supreme Court ever handed down in a case of human rights, Dred Scott v. Sanford. The author of that decision, Chief Justice Roger Taney, was undoubtedly highly qualified from a technical and professional standpoint, yet faced with the fundamental question of whether a former slave had standing to sue to retain his newly acquired free status, Justice Taney wrote that black people were not persons within the meaning of the Framers of the Constitution.
Similarly, Henry Billings Brown, the author of the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision, had impressive professional credentials and academic, as well. He was a graduate of both Harvard and Yale, and his prior judicial experience was on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, but he lacked the values that sensitized him to understand why the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments had to become a part of the Constitution.
On the other hand, it was Justice John Marshall Harlan, the lone dissenter, a graduate of a much smaller law school, the son

of slave owners, who gave us the final word, and it is his word that has rung through the years.
Gentlemen and lady, I would conclude with this observation. Abraham Lincoln stated in his famous speech in 1862 to the Congress that, fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. And it was George Santayana who said, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
But given the nature of the exchanges that I have observed taking place this week in connection with the hearings, I would leave with you the words of Dr. Martin Luther King. He asked and answered these questions. Cowardice asks the question, is it safe? Expediency asks the question, is it politic? Vanity asks the question, is it popular? But conscience must ask the question, is it right? I leave you with those challenges.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Jones. [The prepared statement of Judge Jones appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Our practice in the Committee is to have five-minute rounds. In setting the witness list, we had many, many, many, many requests and we have honored as many as we could with some 30 witnesses, equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. Usually, there is a tilt to the majority, but my decision was to divide them equally. We have a very long road ahead of us. This is the second panel on six. It is my hope that the questions will be abbreviated. We wanted to see you and hear you and have your statements and have your views and look you in the eye. I personally will have just a few questions which I will want to ask, and let me start, Congressman Lewis, with you, with great appreciation for what you have done. The Voting Rights Act, which we labored through in 1982, and I was there in Senator Dole’s office and Senator Kennedy was deeply involved and so was Senator Leahy, so many of us were to get the effects test instead of the intent test so that we have some realistic enforcement of civil rights. Senator Kennedy and I have already conferred. He came to me and said, let us renew the bill this year, the Act this year, if we can. It is the 40th anniversary. We have a jammed agenda, but we are going to try to do that. It will be renewed. It doesn’t expire until 2007. I am very much with you on the objectives and what we have to do. The memoranda which you referred to, and there are quite a number of them, go back to Judge Roberts’s days as a young lawyer and he has testified that he was representing a client and we had real battles with the Reagan administration. There is no doubt about that. I was involved in them, notwithstanding the fact that it was my party. But Congressman Lewis, I would like your views as to how you regarded what Judge Roberts said in explaining his views at the time, or what the memoranda said, which he said were not necessarily his views, and you have to evaluate that, contrast it with the very close questioning by Senator Kennedy and others where he did not raise objections. He said he did not have an agenda to turn back the clock.

Representative LEWIS. It is my view, Chairman, that the Judge was on the wrong side of history. He was on the wrong side of the Voting Rights Act, not just the letter, but also the spirit of the Act.
It is very hard and very difficult, almost impossible, to prove intent. You don’t have—I think Vernon Jordan, the former head of the Urban League, said on one occasion that you won’t have people in the American South, in the 11 Southern States or the Old Confederacy, from Virginia to Texas, couldn’t have signs saying we are going to discriminate. We are going to keep black people from getting elected. They are not going to do that.
I was young, too, a few years ago, 24, 25, but I tried to do the right thing. I got in the way. And I think Judge Roberts as a young attorney in the administration of President Reagan and others failed to go with his gut. Maybe did he go with his gut, did he go with his heart, or was this his view? You don’t come back years later and say, ‘‘Oh no, oh no, this was not my view.’’ Sometimes you have to fight. Sometimes you have to get in the way. If you can’t get in the way when you are 25 or 30, you are not going to get in the way when you are 50.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Congressman Lewis. I just have a minute-forty left and I want to give Governor Thornburgh an opportunity to comment. Based on your knowledge of Judge Roberts, and you worked with him at a time when he was young, do you think that those memoranda reflected his own views as to civil rights or what do your insights and your knowledge of Judge Roberts tell you as to what we might expect of him as Chief Justice, if confirmed, on these issues? Mr. THORNBURGH. Let me say just three things in response to that, Senator. I have never seen any evidence of any hostility to civil rights on the part of Judge Roberts during my professional and personal association with him, which goes back some 15 years. Secondly, I think it is important, and Justice Ginsburg was quite definite in this in her appearance at the time of her nomination, to separate out the views that are expressed as an advocate for a client and the views that might obtain if the individual was speaking for him or herself. And thirdly, I don’t think any of us could stand—perhaps my friend, John Lewis, could because of his distinguished career, but I don’t think any of us could stand a complete and thorough rummaging through the views we expressed when we were 20 or 25 years old. I shudder to think that some of the things that I had in my craw at the time would stand the test today. But most importantly, I think it is my conclusion on the basis of my personal knowledge of Judge Roberts that there is no hostility there to civil rights. There is a veneration of the rule of law, and to the extent that the rule of law permits, it seems to me that he would be a strong supporter of equal rights and equal treatment and equal justice for all under the law. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Governor Thornburgh. This is a very, very distinguished panel and we could hear a great deal more, but my time is up and I have to set the lead on observing the time. Senator Leahy, do you care to question?

Senator LEAHY. Just more a comment. Of course, Governor Thornburgh is a friend of all of ours. We have worked with him during his time as the Attorney General.
You mentioned Justice Ginsburg. Just so the record is clear, her appearance here was a lot different. She answered questions from numerous Senators on race discrimination and affirmative action. From several other Senators, she answered questions on gender discrimination. From several other Senators, she answered questions on reproductive rights. From several other Senators, she answered questions on the death penalty, and then First Amendment and freedom of speech, the Religion Clause of the First Amendment, separation of powers, unenumerated rights, the 14th Amendment, the role of the court, deference to Congress, and then had three or four that she didn’t answer. But she answered specifically from both Republicans and Democrats very intensive questions.
I only mention that because there seems to be some view that when Judge Roberts took, I think, too much to heart the recommendation made by some of the Senators here not to answer questions, he took it too much to heart and did not answer those questions.
When my friend, John Lewis, talks about time to get in the way, he knows of which he speaks. He nearly died doing that. He was doing it for the right cause, the cause of civil rights, and I think every African-American and every white American and every brown American and everybody else, all Americans have to thank you for what you did.
I yield back my time. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator. Does anybody else on the other side of the aisle want to say anything? Senator BROWNBACK. Can I offer one thought, Mr. Chairman, just real quickly if I could. I want to welcome the panel and in particular my friend, John Lewis. We worked a lot on the AfricanAmerican Museum of History and Culture that is going to be here in Washington, D.C., sometime soon. We got that passed through. Judge Jones, if I could just ask you a real brief question on this, because I hear your concerns and I hear the thoughts and I respect the thoughts that you are putting forward here. Judge Roberts, when people asked him, I think Senator Durbin asked him, how do we know what kind of a judge you are going to be on some of these issues? Obviously, you have got a great head, but I want to look at your heart. It is hard to see a man’s heart, and Judge Roberts responded and said, well, look at how I ruled in cases thus far, which there are not a lot of, I think 52 cases thus far, but he does have one Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority case where he ruled against the D.C. Government’s claim of sovereign immunity and in favor of a worker’s disability discrimination lawsuit. It is kind of thin, but we only have 52 cases and that one is there. And then he also talked about his dedication to rule of law and that that is really what drew him into the law. If he is sufficiently dedicated to that rule of law, given the laws that we have on the books how work and protect civil rights and a number of other issues, shouldn’t that give some solace, that if his heart is right on defending the rule of law, given that we have gotten some of the

laws better and right now, that he could be quite a good judge for civil rights cases?
Judge JONES. Thank you for your question, and I would respond this way. I will respond both as a former litigator, a civil rights litigator, and as a judge.
As a judge, you look at the record. The record that has been made here, the part of it that I have observed, shows an early disposition to take positions contrary to civil rights enforcement. The burden that is now imposed upon him and imposed upon this Committee is to be satisfied that the presumption, or at least the inference that one can draw from that prior record has been overcome and that he doesn’t share those views at this time. That is a burden and judgment this Committee has to make.
I would also point out that, if I may just be a little personal, at the time I left my job as General Counsel of the NAACP, a position that I had occupied which Thurgood Marshall also occupied, I have been involved in litigating major civil rights cases all across the country. I joined the court upon appointment by President Carter in 1979. At that time, we thought generally that certain civil rights principles were settled.
We thought that the issue of school desegregation was settled in light of Chief Justice Burger’s decision in Swann in which he said that busing and transportation was an appropriate remedy when you had a finding of constitutional violations that rigged a school district. We thought the issue of affirmative action was settled with the Bakke case and Justice Powell’s plurality opinion in which he says you may take race into account.
But we find that following that case, or those cases which I thought were settled, I was then sitting as a judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and I was engaged in dealing with the first wave of attacks against school desegregation and against affirmative action. The challenges claiming preferential treatment, claiming forced busing, all of these buzzwords were coming at the court and we were then faced with the decision, are these principles settled?
I have now learned that in the boiler room of the Reagan administration, stoking out and crafting out a lot of the theories that were being used in the courts to attack these settled principles, was the nominee. Now, that raises a question for me and for you, or this Committee, to decide whether if one is a believer in the rule of law, why one would not accept Swann as settled law, would not accept Bakke as settled law, would not accept Weber as settled law.
The whole body of jurisprudence that had been built up to reaffirm the value of remedial actions when it was clear that we had this vast history of racial discrimination in this country—
Senator BROWNBACK. If I could, before my time runs out, just quickly say I appreciate the thought. I do think we have to—
Chairman SPECTER. Quickly, Senator Brownback. We have to move on.
Senator BROWNBACK. Okay. We do know what Judge Roberts has ruled, what he has done as a judge, and I would hope people could look at that in the fair light of what it is in indicating his judicial temperament and nature.
Thanks, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Brownback. We are going to break for lunch at the conclusion of this panel.
Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I don’t think any of us in the course of the time of questioning Judge Roberts ever suggested that in any way he had any hostility on the issues of race. I really think the question was does he get it. Does he get it? Just what the good judge as pointed out, the march towards progress that we have seen over the recent years. So I would ask Mr. Henderson and then John Lewis, how about this argument: Well, he was just an attorney. He was just attorney who was speaking for an administration. He was just taking the administration’s position. So we shouldn’t be too harsh on this. Sure, the administration just wanted the reauthorization of the intent test; he was just following orders, so to speak, on this. So why should we not assume that he gets it with regard to the issues of this Nation’s great, great challenge, the poison of discrimination that is there since the first days of it? And we have all seen, including in my own State of Massachusetts, the challenges that we face. Why can’t—what is your response to that? Mr. HENDERSON. Well, Senator, I certainly recognize a legitimate argument that an individual representing a client often projects the views that best suit the client. But I remind you, sir, that Judge Roberts never once distanced himself from positions articulated in many of the memoranda at issue in a way that would give comfort to the notion that he in fact had not internalized these views to reflect his own policies. Judge Roberts has a vision of judicial restraint, and he has articulated it himself—which is really a retreat from the role of the Federal courts in protecting civil rights. And I guess, you know, from my view, this is really not an academic debate. It is very personal. I mean, I grew up right here in the Nation’s capital. I was 16 before formal segregation ended by law. I know what it is like to be on the politically disfavored side of the color line. And I know that the Federal courts have played an important role in helping to ensure equal opportunity for all of American citizens. We are not prepared to take that risk. I would simply say that even in today’s society, Senator Brownback mentioned earlier, well, laws have changed, things have happened, they have improved. Certainly that is true. But in the words of William Faulkner, you know, the past is never dead; in fact, it’s not even past. And just to confirm that point, I have a pending complaint right now before the Department of Justice for a case of public accommodation discrimination from a hotel in New Orleans over the 4th of July weekend in an area where I thought change had been made in a lasting way that would not have permitted that to happen. I know first-hand what that stigma is about, and I reject that analysis. Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is true that we did ask him, I asked him, about whether any of these positions that he had taken at that time, whether he would reverse any of these. And we didn’t hear a response from him that he might.

Let me ask John Lewis to comment on that and then also—I have a minute and a half, John, so you know this business. So I hope you will respond to the earlier question to Wade, but I hope also—when Judge Roberts was asked about the intent test and the effects test, and he was asked also by members of the Committee, well, if we had actually had the intent test, do you think we would have made the progress we made with the effects test? He said, I’m not so sure we might not have made that kind of progress on that.
We know the earth-shattering progress that has been made with the election of officials locally, State, and at the Federal level, and the progress that has been made with the effects test. I am interested in someone who knows and believes that the Voting Rights Act is the key civil rights issue. What is your own view on this question? How could anyone view that if we had had the intent test we would be where we are today? Wouldn’t we be a different land?
Representative LEWIS. Well, I tell you, Senator, as someone who worked in the American South for several years directing an organization called the Voter Education Project, for 7 years trying to get people registered, trying to get people to lose their sense of fear, I tell you, we wouldn’t be where we are today. The American South would be different, the country would be different if we had to rely on the intent test. I wouldn’t be here as a Member of Congress. And a lot of my colleagues in the House of Representatives, a lot of the elected officials all across the South, before the Voting Rights Act in 1965, there were less than 50 black elected officials in the 11 Southern States, from Virginia to Texas. Today, there are more than 9,000. We wouldn’t have made it. There still would be people trying to get elected and they wouldn’t be elected.
I don’t buy this argument that he was just doing his job, he was just following the rules. By this time you had the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act of 1968. By this time if there was someone in the administration, they should have a mindset. I think this says something about Judge Roberts’s mindset. He didn’t stand up and argue against this attitude. He didn’t speak out. He didn’t send a memo saying something different.
Senator KENNEDY. My time is up. But thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Kennedy. Senator Durbin? Senator DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to the panel. Let me first thank my colleague, Senator Kennedy. I think that during the course of this inquiry of Judge Roberts he has been laser-focused on civil rights and the Voting Rights Act, and I think it has done a great service to the operation of the Committee. I hope that we all appreciate how much work went into it. But I do recall, Senator Kennedy, on the first day when you went into this, I made notes how Judge Roberts said repeatedly, That was 23 years ago; I was a staff lawyer of the Justice Department; that was the position for the administration I worked for; it was my job to articulate administration policy. We heard that consistently whenever we brought up these memos. And so I thought to myself, well, in fairness, if we are going to allow him to use that explanation, what does he feel today? What

474
can he tell us today? I personally believe in redemption, in faith and politics. And I think, John Lewis, you have seen so many in the past who were on the wrong side of history on civil rights who realized it and conceded that and moved to a different position.
During the course of this hearing, we asked Judge Roberts many questions. In fairness to him, one of the few direct questions he answered was when I asked him about the Bob Jones University case. And he said, I disagree with the position of the Reagan administration. I am glad he said that. I wish he could have told us more.
Then I tried, in my last round of questioning, to get down to a point of where would you draw the line as an advocate? Are there some things you would not bring your legal skills to? You have spoken with pride of Romber v. Evans and the fact that you counseled gays and lesbians who were about to lose their rights in Colorado. And just a few hours ago I asked him, sitting at the same table, Could you have taken the other position, to restrict the rights? And he said yes.
And so it comes down to a fundamental question. I don’t think I understand if there is a clear, bright line in his mind when it comes to this issue of freedom and when it comes to this issue of liberty. And that troubles me. Because I think, knowing that, I would feel more confident that he could lead this Court.
But I would like to ask you, John Lewis, on the issue of redemption, do you feel that even if he was totally wrong 23 years ago or 24 years ago in his memos, that people can change?
Representative LEWIS. Well, I think it’s possible and conceivable, Senator, that people can change. But when you believe and feel and know from your experience, or maybe from the law and from history that you have been wrong, you show some sign. And you are not afraid to talk about it. You are not afraid to go on the record. Judge Roberts has been afraid to show or demonstrate any signs that he has changed. I wonder whether it is part of his mindset.
Senator DURBIN. I think that is the point, and maybe Wade Henderson made the same point, that when Senator Kennedy went directly to the Voting Rights Act, much like Bob Jones University, he could have made it clear that that position was just wrong and that history had proven it wrong. And yet for two successive days it came up short.
Wade Henderson, you have made that point in what you had to say here. The critical question is values and just not competence here in what we are dealing with. Judge Jones said the same.
So I don’t want to dwell on this any longer other than to tell you, for me this is the threshold issue. The issue of race is the threshold issue. I have to be convinced in my mind that Judge Roberts comes to this critical job as the head of the third branch of our Government with a clear understanding of what we must do in this country, still, to deal with the issues of race and justice for so many minorities in this country.
Thank you all on this panel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Durbin. Thank you very much— Mr. KIRSANOW. Mr. Chairman, with your permission, if I could just make one quick clarification.

475
Chairman SPECTER. Go ahead. Mr. KIRSANOW. Thank you very much. We have been talking about redemption, and I don’t think that John Roberts needs to be redeemed in any sense whatsoever. But to the extent one claims that his position on the Voting Rights Act was somehow wrong prior to the effects test, let’s take a look at the facts. After the effects test was implemented, what did Judge Roberts do? He argued Chisholm v. Romer, he argued the Houston Lawyers Association— he argued for an extension of the effects test to State judicial elections. If he redeemed himself at all, he clearly did it right there. So we have facts here. This is not speculative. In terms of looking at his heart, if it is conflated with what he has done on the court—and I don’t know that you can necessarily discern that—we have absolute evidence of what he felt about enforcement of the effects test. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Commissioner. Senator Sessions wants a minute recognition before we break for a very abbreviated lunch. Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to add, I have been listening to some of this as I could. I would just like to add that we procured explanations from Judge Roberts on each one of the memorandums he wrote, each one of the situations that he was called to express an opinion on, such as the effects test. His ruling was absolutely consistent with the Supreme Court ruling of the United States at that time. So all I would say is I think it is unfair to suggest that he has a record that indicates that he was somehow wrong on civil rights at that time. Yes, he opposed quotas; yes, he supported the extension of the Voting Rights Act completely, but he did not favor its alteration to overrule a Supreme Court opinion. So I would just, for the record, like to say I believe his record does show affirmatively that he is committed to equal justice under law, which is what he is called upon to do. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Sessions. Senator Kennedy, you have a unanimous consent request? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent—the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund prepared some important testimony—that it be made a part of the record. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Thank you all very much. We have so many witnesses, we are going to have an abbreviated—not a lunch hour, but a lunch halfhour. We will resume at 2 o’clock. [Whereupon, at 1:30 p.m., the Committee was recessed, to reconvene at 2:00 p.m., this same day.] AFTERNOON SESSION [2:16 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We will resume the confirmation hearing on Judge Roberts. We have a distinguished panel, and our first witness is Ms. Maureen Mahoney, a partner in the Washington firm of Latham and Watkins. She had worked with Judge Roberts in the Deputy Solicitor General’s office. She had been nominated for a district court judgeship, but with some others, her nomination was not taken up, a

problem we intend to correct. She successfully represented the University of Michigan in the Grutter case, and she served as law clerk to Associate Justice Rehnquist and Seventh Circuit Judge Robert Sprecher.
Thank you for joining us, Ms. Mahoney, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY, PARTNER, LATHAM AND WATKINS, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Ms. MAHONEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. It is a real honor to be here today.
Over the past few days, I think all of you and really all of America has gotten to see why so many of us think that Judge Roberts is probably the finest lawyer of our generation. His study of the law, his understanding of the law is absolutely masterful, and he certainly has the legal skills required to be a superb Chief Justice.
Some have, nevertheless, raised some concerns that he may come to the Court committed to implement a partisan agenda and that he may not be fair-minded. I would really like to speak to those concerns based on my personal experiences with him. As you indicated, I met him in 1980 after he succeeded me as a clerk to the Chief Justice, then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. Since that time, I had the opportunity to be his colleague in the Solicitor General’s office. I also was a fellow appellate advocate in the private bar and really also a friend. This has given me a very, very wonderful opportunity to take the measure of this man, and I cannot think of anyone who would be a finer Chief Justice.
I would like to make three basic observations to respond to some of these issues, and the first is that in the Solicitor General’s office, when I worked with him there, he was not viewed as a partisan operative. Instead, he was viewed as a brilliant advocate in the finest tradition of the office. And, in fact, in 2001, this office included lawyers from all across the political spectrum. They weren’t just Republicans or Democrats, and they all admired him. And in 2001, they sent a letter to this Committee to confirm that, despite their diverse political parties and persuasions, ‘‘Mr. Roberts was attentive to and respectful of all views, and he represented the United States zealously but fairly. He had the deepest respect for legal principles and legal precedent.’’ This from his colleagues. He was not a highly partisan person in that role.
The second thing I would like to say to the Committee is please do not presume that the views that are expressed in briefs on behalf of the United States that he filed in the Solicitor General’s office necessarily reflect the views that he will adopt as a Justice on the Supreme Court. I was a deputy there, too. It was not our job to establish administration policy with respect to immigration, abortion, affirmative action—you name it. Our job was to defend the policies of the administration within the bounds of the law, within the realm of good logic, good reasoning. That was our job. And, in fact, a historical example might be useful on this.
Thurgood Marshall served as a Solicitor General of the United States, and while Solicitor General, he filed a brief on behalf of the United States advocating against the rule adopted in Miranda because he said it wasn’t good for law enforcement. When he became

477
a Supreme Court Justice, he dissented in cases that refused to extend Miranda more broadly. He abandoned the views that he had previously expressed in a brief because they weren’t his views. They were the views of the United States. And I fully expect that Judge Roberts also knows the differences in these roles in our legal system.
Third, I have been particularly troubled about suggestions in the media that he may harbor bias against women, and I say this because I know firsthand that he was very interested in promoting equal opportunity for women. He actually recruited me to the Office of Solicitor General in 1991. There was a vacancy for the deputy slot. There are only four deputies in the office at any given time. This is a highly coveted position. And he called me, he encouraged me to come and apply for that job. He supported me. I got the job and, as a result, was one of the very few women in history to serve in that position.
A year later, a vacancy came open on the Eastern District of Virginia, the Federal court, and he again encouraged me to apply. He helped shepherd me through that nomination process, and as you indicated, for some reason the Committee forgot to get me confirmed. But, really, these were things that Judge Roberts did not just for me but for other women who all admire and respect him and have absolutely no doubt that he harbors no bias.
In sum, I think that he is particularly well suited to succeed the Chief Justice. They both share some incredible traits, really exquisite intelligence, an abiding sense of modesty, charming wit, and I think that the Chief above all understood that the role of a judge is to serve, not to rule. And I think that there is no question that Judge Roberts learned that lesson well, and he ought to be confirmed as the next Chief Justice.

Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, your statement will be made a part of the record, as will all statements.
Ms. BROWNER. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, as you just noted, I have spent most of my professional life involved in our country’s efforts to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, the health of our communities, the health of our children. Our environmental laws and regulations have allowed us to make steady progress in this country toward cleaner air, cleaner water, a healthy environment.
While it is not always a perfect system, a dismantling of this system could leave our country without any sensible way to address ongoing environmental problems such as mercury, the disappearance of our wetlands, and the reality of global warming.
Briefly, I want to speak to three issues: the Commerce Clause, the power of Congress to delegate to the executive branch, and citizen standing.
More than 40 years ago, Congress realized that individual States often lack the power or the will to do the job of lessening and reducing pollution. Congress recognized that pollution doesn’t stop at political boundaries. Dirty air blows across the country without regard for where it originates, and polluted water inevitably flows downstream. Relying on its Commerce Claus authority, Congress passed a whole body of environmental legislation.
The Supreme Court’s decisions in Lopez and Morrison have triggered an effort to undermine Congress’s use of its Commerce Clause authority in a number of environmental statutes, including the Clean Water Act. In the SWANCC decision, a case involving wetlands, the petitions argued that Congress lacked the authority under the Commerce Clause to protect isolated wetlands. Well, as we have all been recently reminded with Katrina, wetlands are a very important part of nature’s efforts to protect us from flooding, to cleanse our waters, to provide important habitat.
While the Court avoided ruling on the Commerce Clause challenge in SWANCC, it is troubling that the majority did note ‘‘significant constitutional questions regarding the authority of Congress to protect certain types of wetlands, even those used by migratory birds.’’
I want to quote from Justice Kennedy. Although he joined with the majority, he noted in Lopez, ‘‘The Court as an institution and the legal system as a whole have an immense stake in the stability of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as it has evolved to this point.’’ While Judge Roberts’s dissenting opinion from denial of rehearing in Viejo, the case that is now referred to as the ‘‘hapless toad’’ case, is not definitive as to his position on the Commerce Clause, it is certainly worth noting that a three-judge panel had rejected a Commerce Clause argument with respect to the Endangered Species Act.
Lower-court judges have also attempted to restrict the authority of Congress to delegate certain powers to the executive branch. In a case I was personally involved with about my decision to set air pollution standards for ozone and smog, the lower court struck down a key section of the Clean Air Act as unconstitutional, citing the non-delegation doctrine, which had been rejected by courts for more than 50 years. For decades, Congress has asked EPA, told

479
EPA to do this job, to do it based on the best available science, to do it to protect the public health. These are sort of fundamental principles embedded in many of our environmental statutes that have allowed us to make the kind of progress that we have made to date.
Finally, Congress has frequently recognized the right of individual citizens to seek enforcement of our country’s environmental laws. When I was the head of the EPA, I was frequently asked, Well, wouldn’t you like Congress to prevent those lawsuits from being filed against you, those lawsuits from being filed against your agency? And my answer was always no. Citizen suits are an essential part of how we have gone about this work of clean air and clean water. If Congress tells an agency of the executive branch to do something and they fail to do it, the citizens of this country should have the right to go to our courts and see that Congress’s laws are upheld.
A key role and responsibility of Government is to protect those things we all hold in common—our air, our water, the public health of our communities. The Nation’s environmental laws are based on a set of shared values, and they rest on principles embraced by Congress over many, many years. The High Court should respect the broad authority of Congress under the Constitution and wellestablished precedents that allow for a robust Federal role in protecting our environment. The Court should continue to recognize the right of Congress to delegate to the executive branch the dayto-day work, to set pollution standards, to enforce those standards, and the Court must ensure the opportunity for individual citizens to step in when the executive branch fails to do what Congress has directed.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Browner appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Browner. Our next witness is Professor Kathryn Webb Bradley, senior lecturing fellow at the Duke University School of Law, graduate of Wake Forest and the University of Maryland, first in her class, clerked for Justice White, later became a litigator at Hogan and Hartson. We thank you very much for coming in today, Professor Bradley, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF KATHRYN WEBB BRADLEY, SENIOR LECTURING FELLOW, DUKE LAW SCHOOL, DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA
Ms. BRADLEY. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, thank you for allowing me to be here today.
I have been a Democrat since I was old enough to vote. But while the President has not enjoyed my personal support, his nominee has my full and enthusiastic support today. I have known John Roberts since 1990 when I was privileged to serve as law clerk to Justice Byron White. As a law clerk, I watched then-Deputy Solicitor General Roberts argue several cases before the Court. While I was fortunate to see many talented advocates that year, John Roberts stood out in my mind as simply the best.

What made him so effective was his gift for being able to take extraordinarily complex concepts and then explain them in a way that seemed straightforward, even simple, yet never simplistic. His command of the facts and the law of each case was impressive, not just because of the level of preparation it revealed, but because it enabled him to anticipate and respond to the concerns of the Court about whatever position he was advocating. Inevitably, his colloquy with the Court left the impression that he had blazed for the Court a clear trail that they could comfortably follow to reach the result he sought.
That is not to say that he was successful in every case, but I do believe that in each case his advocacy aided the Court in its decisionmaking process, which is precisely what good advocacy should do.
My admiration for his advocacy skills deepened into a deep respect for his intellect and his integrity during the time we were colleagues at Hogan and Hartson, where I worked with him on a number of appellate and administrative matters. What I remember most clearly, though, are not the details of the cases in which I assisted him, but about the times when his guidance proved invaluable to me. I have time for one of those stories today.
I was a senior associate involved in the defense of a State institution in a suit brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The plaintiff had initially filed suit in Federal court, but dismissed the complaint and refiled in State court after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Seminole Tribe v. Flordia. As I began to look at the issues, I wondered whether we might move to dismiss the State suit on constitutional sovereign immunity grounds similar to those that had mandated dismissal of the Federal suit.
But the only helpful legal authority were a few State trial court cases and one or two articles. So I called John Roberts and I ran the argument by him.
His response was that while I had a colorable legal argument, the theory I was suggesting certainly did not fit within his understanding of the Court’s interpretation of the 11th Amendment. We proceeded to file the motion, and when we lost the motion, we filed an appeal, and at each stage, even though he was not directly involved in the case, John was supportive and responsive to my questions. And when our appeal was stayed, pending the Supreme Court’s consideration of Alden v. Maine, which raised exactly the issue that we were litigating, at my request, John Roberts conducted a moot court for the Council for Maine since a decision favorable to Maine would be favorable to our client.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Alden focused new attention on federalism and received kudos from many conservatives, yet at no point during the time that I worked with John Roberts on this issue did I ever hear him voice anything other than his understanding of the governing precedent and his thoughtful and considered views about what arguments appropriately could be made within the existing legal framework. I certainly never saw any signs at all that he viewed the case as an opportunity to promote a conservative ideology or advance a particular political agenda.
I believe the qualities that I have admired in John Roberts for the last 15 years are precisely those that qualify him to become the

next Chief Justice. The mastery of the law that he exhibited in oral arguments leaves little doubt that he will be able to find a principled way through the murkiest of constitutional waters. His focus on the facts of the case and the circumstances of his clients, suggest that as Chief Justice he will approach each case on its individual merits. His respect for precedent, with his cautious approach to moving beyond its established bounds, offers reassurance that he will respect the role of stare decisis. And his collegiality and his congeniality will enable him to lead the Court as Chief Justice with grace and style.
I would like to make two final points. First, in part because of my experience as a Supreme Court clerk, I have development tremendous respect and an appreciation of the role of the Court and the role of the rule of law in safeguarding our democracy.
As a professor of law I make it my business now to try and instill that respect in the students I teach. I could not in good conscience come before you today were I not convinced that John Roberts shares that respect, and will demonstrate it every day that he serves the Court and this Nation as Chief Justice.
Finally, as both a Democrat and a woman, it is fundamentally important to me that the individual liberties of every citizen, including those relating to the right to privacy and the right to be free from discrimination be fully protected. I could not be here today if I did not feel confident in trusting my own rights and those of my children and their generation to John Roberts for safekeeping.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Bradley appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Bradley. Our next witness is Ms. Anne Marie Tallman, General Counsel of the Mexican Legal Defense and Education Fund, actually President and General Counsel. Prior to taking that position she had been an executive with Fannie Mae.

Ms. TALLMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. Thank you for the invitation to testify before you today on the confirmation of John Roberts for the post of Chief Justice of the United States.
I am Ann Marie Tallman, President and General Counsel of MALDEF, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. We are a nonpartisan civil rights organization established to promote and protect the civil rights of over 40 million Latinos in the area of education, voting rights, immigrants rights, access to the courts and employment.
It is in these areas that the writings and decisions of Judge Roberts placed him in positions opposed not only to equal justice for

Latinos, but opposed to the positions taken by bipartisan majorities of this Congress, and even by the Reagan administration that he served.
There has been much discussion about respect for the law. This hearing is not an abstract discussion. It serves as an acknowledgement of how the law’s application impacts all of us, living, working and contributing to the richness of our country, regardless of our station in life.
A Chief Justice must approach his responsibilities with not only an open mind, but cognizant of how his decisions will affect real people. If some of John Roberts’s written legal views had been adopted and become settled Federal law, thousands of undocumented immigrant children would have effectively been barred from public schools, left largely illiterate and without hope as members of a permanent underclass. A national system of identification cards might be in place, representing an unprecedented intrusion in the privacy rights of Americans, and placing minorities at much greater risk of racial profiling and discrimination. An electoral empowerment of Latinos, African-Americans, Asian-Americans and Native Americans and the record number of elected officials of these ancestries in Congress and State and local government nationwide would likely have not been achieved.
On immigrants rights, as Special Assistant to the Attorney General, he criticized the Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe, a case brought by MALDEF. In Plyler the Court, following two lower courts, struck down a Texas law effectively barring undocumented children from public schools. Roberts criticized the Solicitor General’s Office for not standing up for what he described as judicial restraint and supporting the State of Texas arguments against the application of the Equal Protection Clause, an action, he wrote, that could well have altered the outcome of the case.
As Associate White House Counsel he derided, as clinging to symbolism, the civil liberties and privacy concerns surrounding national identification cards. In expressing his disagreement with the Reagan administration’s opposition to national identifiers, he failed to even mention the potential for discrimination and singling out of Latinos and African-Americans.
In voting rights, Judge Roberts mischaracterized the bipartisan efforts by members of this Committee to restore the effects test to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act as a radical experiment, rather than a restoration of Congress’s original purpose.
Finally, a Chief Justice must possess an even temperament in fulfilling his duties to dispassionately adjudicate with an open mind. We need men and women on the Court who will understand our changing Nation. Strikingly, on official White House Counsel and Department of Justice memoranda, Judge Roberts displayed a pattern of insensitivity and dismissive comments that show a lack of respect for Latino immigrants, Members of Congress who supported equal pay for women, and the history of the Kickapoo Indian Tribe.
For these reasons, we respectfully urge that you oppose Judge John Roberts’s confirmation to serve as Chief Justice of the United States.
Thank you very much.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Tallman. Our next witness is Judge Denise Posse-Blanco Lindberg, a State Court Judge in Utah. An immigrant from Cuba, Judge Lindberg and her family fled Castro, coming here when she was 10-years-old. After receiving her bachelor’s degree from BYU she then added three advanced degrees, including a law degree. Among her many accomplishments are clerkship for Justice O’Connor. She worked in the D.C. Office of the Law Firm of Hogan & Hartson, and has been a State Court Judge in Utah since 1998. Thank you for joining us, Judge Lindberg, and your testimony begins simultaneously with the re-arrival of Senator Hatch. [Laughter.] Senator HATCH. I would not miss this for the world, I will tell you.
STATEMENT OF DENISE POSSE-BLANCO LINDBERG, JUDGE, THIRD JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT, STATE OF UTAH, SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH
Judge LINDBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. My name is Denise Posse-Blanco Lindberg, and I am a State Trial Court Judge from the State of Utah. I am honored to appear before you today in enthusiastic support for the nomination of Judge John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States.
He brings to this appointment a keen intellect, sound judgment, honesty, fairness and decency, and exceptional knowledge of and respect for the law, the courts, and our constitutional system. He has all the attributes necessary to be a Chief Justice in the highest traditions of that office.
Over the past 15 years, I have observed his career from at least three different vantage points; first as a law clerk to Justice Sandra Day O’Connor; second as his colleague at the Washington, D.C. law firm of Hogan and Hartson; and as a member of the Appellate Practice Group, which he headed; and now as a fellow judge who has reviewed his judicial record.
My first exposure to Judge Roberts came on opening day of October term 1990 at the Supreme Court when then-Deputy Solicitor General Roberts presented one of the First Monday arguments. I expected a professional presentation from members of the Solicitor General’s office, but the skill and effectiveness with which he argued his case far exceeded my expectations. Notwithstanding his youth, his composure, his clear command of the relevant facts in law, and his exceptional ability to engage with the Court in a discussion of the issues made a lasting impression on me.
After clerking for Justice O’Connor, I joined Hogan’s appellate practice group and I worked with John on a number of cases following his return to the firm. I remember many cases that we worked on, but I specifically remember his support and guidance during my first solo effort at drafting a brief for a case before the D.C. Circuit. It was a pro bono matter and he willingly spent considerable time reviewing drafts, providing feedback, and that was invariably insightful, helpful, and courteous. He analyzed issues creatively without distorting precedent or stretching a point of law

beyond what was permitted by the bounds of law. And on top of that, he was an incredibly nice, genuine human being who was incredibly bright but never arrogant.
John’s work has always been principled and carefully circumscribed. I learned much of what I know about appellate practice from watching John work and being taught by him. He reveres the law and he treats it and everyone associated with it with the utmost respect. He has taught by word and deed the importance of civility in the practice of law.
My final comments come from perspective as a judge. I reviewed a substantial number of his body of published opinions and some of the commentary. I have noted at least three problems with some of that commentary. Some commentators have failed to acknowledge that judges do not get to choose the cases that come before them but must instead respond to the particular facts in light of applicable law.
Others overlook the fact that whenever an appellate judge writes for the court, that opinion must also reflect the views of at least one, if not two, other members of the appellate panel.
Others appear to misunderstand the essential judicial role. John has correctly noted that judges, quote, ‘‘do not have a commission to solve society’s problems as they see them, but simply to decide cases before them according to the rule of law.’’
In each opinion that I reviewed, John focused on the case before him, did not overreach, or did not use it as a vehicle to further any personal preferences. He was respectful of precedent. In fact, he demonstrated the very kind of judicial restraint that this body has indicated is an important consideration for any nominee to the Court.
To this high office, John brings a remarkable combination of skills, personality, and respect for constitutional principles that will make him a highly effective Chief Justice. His towering intellectual skills and engaging personality will enable John to work effectively with his colleagues and bring consensus to a divided Court. Those same traits will make him an outstanding leader of the Federal judiciary and will allow him to work very cooperatively with the coordinate branches of government.
I respectfully urge this Committee to recommend to the full Senate swift confirmation of John Roberts as Chief Justice of the United States. Thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Lindberg. [The prepared statement of Judge Lindberg appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Our final witness on the panel is Mr. Reginald Turner, President of the National Bar Association, the nation’s oldest and largest association of African-American lawyers. A member of the Detroit-based law firm of Clark, Hill, he has been a White House fellow and worked as an aide to former HUD Secretaries Cisneros and Cuomo. He has a law degree from the University of Michigan and an undergraduate degree from Wayne State University. We appreciate your being here, Mr. Turner, and the floor is yours.

STATEMENT OF REGINALD M. TURNER, JR., PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION, DETROIT, MICHIGAN
Mr. TURNER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. To Chairman Specter and to all the members of the Committee, the National Bar Association appreciates this opportunity to address you on behalf of the network of over 20,000 lawyers of color who are members of the National Bar Association and on behalf of our 80 affiliates across the Nation and around the world.
Here with me today is the Chair of the National Bar Association’s Judicial Selection Committee, Assistant Dean Alfreda Robinson from the George Washington University School of Law, who has worked tirelessly to prepare us for this moment. We are also joined by Theodore Shaw, the Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, whose efforts have contributed to the advancement of civil rights and civil liberties for well over a decade.
The significance of the confirmation of the Chief Justice of the United States cannot be overstated. We ask this Committee to ensure that any nominee is extraordinarily qualified before giving this esteemed position.
The National Bar Association has established a fair process and fair criteria for evaluating judicial nominees. We take a position on a nomination only after a complete and exhaustive review of the nominee’s record. We have reviewed Judge Roberts’s entire record, including his professional and educational background, and the available records of his years as a government lawyer. The record is, unfortunately, complex and troubling. It is also incomplete. Judge Roberts has impressive educational credentials and a distinguished employment history, but these credentials alone are not sufficient to qualify a lawyer or judge to be Chief Justice of the United States.
Sadly, this Nation was founded on principles and laws that denied many rights and privileges, including the right to vote and of citizenship to African-Americans and women. Throughout our history, however, the Supreme Court has helped to advance our Nation toward the ideal of equal justice under law, and the effect of that work on African-Americans is perhaps unduplicated with respect to any other people in the United States.
Many of the cases in which the Supreme Court has advanced equal justice under law have been decided by razor-thin margins, most typically five-to-four. Accordingly, the stakes in this appointment could not be higher.
As Senator Edward Kennedy stated earlier during this hearing, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina has exposed America’s continued racial inequities and economic disparities. In this country, race and treatment of racial issues by the judiciary profoundly affect every aspect of American life and play critical roles in the formulation of American social, economic, and political agendas.
Accordingly, the National Bar Association must determine whether a Federal judicial nominee will interpret the Constitution and laws to effectuate racial equality and eliminate oppression.
Despite the claims of neutrality and equality, our legal system is not yet as colorblind as it should be. In Grutter v. Bollinger, which upheld the use of affirmative action, Supreme Court Justice Sandra

486
Day O’Connor acknowledged that. She said, and I quote, ‘‘in a society like our own, race unfortunately still matters.’’
Therefore, a judicial nominee’s record should demonstrate support for constitutional principles, statutes, and legal documents that serve to extend the blessings of liberty to all Americans, including people of color.
Unfortunately, the available record on Judge Roberts precludes us from supporting his nomination. We take the position on the following grounds.
The record is incomplete, as many important documents have been withheld from this Committee and from the public. There are numerous available documents demonstrating that the nominee does not support civil rights, civil liberties, and equal justice under law. He has argued for the use of inordinately restrictive standing analysis to limit access for groups seeking to promote civil rights and civil liberties. He has argued for reducing the authority of Federal courts even to hear cases relating to civil rights and civil liberties, and he has argued for restriction of the Federal court’s ability to remedy those violations.
In conclusion, on the basis of our thorough review of the available record on Judge Roberts and for the reasons cited above, the National Bar Association cannot support this confirmation.
Earlier, there was a reference to memoranda. It is really important to note that those memoranda reflecting Judge Roberts’s views, which have not been repudiated during the course of these hearings, must be considered by this Committee as reflecting his current views. We thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Turner appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. A vote has been called and we are in the latter stages of it. There are a great many questions which we could benefit from on dialogue. As I have said earlier, we have invited 30 witnesses. We had many, many, many requests and we accommodated as many as we could, but it realistically precludes very much by way of questioning. We have a Utah judge here. Senator Hatch, do you have a comment or two? Senator HATCH. I do, as a matter of fact I just want to thank you all for appearing, but I just want to chat a little bit about my good friend and Utah judge here. Judge Lindberg, given your unique and impressive personal, academic, and legal background, I think you are in a strong position to offer an opinion on Judge Roberts. Not only did you serve there at that law firm, but you have one of the strongest backgrounds of any woman lawyer in this country, as a woman with a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father who fled Cuba as a young child and then went on to a distinguished academic career, earning two Master’s degrees and then a Ph.D. and then who went on to the Brigham Young University School of Law and got a law degree there with honors, and then knowing something of the Supreme Court from the inside from your time that you spent as a law clerk to Sandra Day O’Connor, and then working at the highest levels of the legal profession, including your work, as mentioned, as a col-

league of Judge Roberts at the law firm of Hogan and Hartson, and now having spent the last 7 years on the bench yourself in one of Utah’s trial courts, I am very, very pleased to have you here.
I was particularly pleased to listen to your experiences as a woman, as a minority, as an able jurist in that you believe Judge Roberts’s qualifications to be as good as anybody could possibly have. That means a lot to me, and I personally want to pay tribute to you as somebody who has not only excelled in the legal profession, but deserves the accolades that I have just given. Thank you for coming. I appreciate you being here.
I appreciate all of you and your testimony. Whether or not we agree or disagree, we appreciate that you have taken time to come and discuss these matters with us.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Just briefly, and thank you. Ms. Tallman, what kind of America would we be if the Judge’s position on the Plyler case had been the findings and we had that kind of an education policy to many Hispanic families? Ms. TALLMAN. The Plyler decision was a very important piece of litigation decided before the United States Supreme Court that has profound impacts on the ability of undocumented immigrant children, who are in this country by no fault of their own, the ability of them to be protected under Constitution, upholding over 100 years of jurisprudence that prove that aliens were persons under the Constitution and that education was something that these children should be able to access. If that decision had been decided differently, because judicial restraint pursuant to Judge Roberts’s view would have been followed, the Equal Protection Clause may not have been applied in that case and, as a result, we would have a permanent underclass of children in this country who would be unable to access public education. Senator KENNEDY. And your response to his position, well, that was the position of the administration and he was just carrying forward the administration’s policy? Did you find out—I asked him about the great decision that Justice Warren, the great Brown decision, he said, was settled law with regard to black children—did you find it somewhat troublesome that he had a different interpretation when it came to children of Hispanics? Ms. TALLMAN. I think the concern that we have on Plyler is that on the memo that he wrote on the day of the decision, in June of 1982, his instant reaction was to ignore the Supreme Court’s rationale regarding the important societal impact of the decision and focus on how it would have resulted in potentially a different outcome had judicial restraint been followed. That is his personal view, that he thought judicial restraint should have been or could have been followed had the Solicitor General’s Office followed a different approach. And I think that, with his ongoing perspectives of the limited involvement of the Federal Government in the protection of people’s civil rights, I believe that Judge Roberts’s views are that limited involvement—no remarks during this hearing to state that he feels strongly about the decision in Plyler, and his memo on the day of the decision all raise very serious concerns for us.

Senator KENNEDY. Carol Browner, let me just ask you about the Judge’s 1983 position about the nondelegation doctrine, the constitutional anomaly of independent agencies. This is the recognition—it is the unified presidency, meaning that these independent agencies really don’t have the authority to carry—If we carried that concept through to its logical end, where would we be, for example, on environmental issues, just generally, on clean air, clean water?
Ms. BROWNER. Well, I think we would be in complete disarray and the amount of protections we have been able to provide to date probably wouldn’t be there. I mean, Congress has very wisely delegated to the Environmental Protection Agency the difficult work of making sure that all the science is there before a pollution standard is set, making sure that both industry and the public at large get to comment on this. There is a whole process that unfolds. If Congress were not able to delegate that authority to the executive branch, to the independent agencies, I suspect that either nothing would happen or it would happen much more slowly, because Congress would be left to do that.
We made a decision when I was in the administration to set tough public health air pollution standards for ozone and fine particles, sometimes referred to as soot and smog. These are standards that will prevent tens of thousands of premature deaths. They are very important. A lower court found that that was an unconstitutional provision of the Clean Air Act. In the Supreme Court we did win 9–0, but it is important to protect that going forward.
Senator KENNEDY. My time is just about up. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Kennedy. Thank you all. The time has expired, so we are going to go to vote. There may be two votes, but we will be back as promptly as we can to proceed with Panel IV. Thank you all very much. [Recess from 2:57 p.m. to 3:16 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume. Before turning to our fourth panel, I want to correct the record on a statement which I made yesterday when I was questioning Judge Roberts on U.S. v. Morrison and the alleged rape of a woman. I said by three VMI students, Virginia Military Institute, and that was incorrect. It was VPI, Virginia Polytech Institute. I regret the confusion and apologize to VMI and correct the record. And now, on to the panel. Our first witness is Ms. Catherine Stetson, a partner in Hogan and Hartson concentrating on appellate and Supreme Court litigation. She had been clerk to Judge Harris on the D.C. District Court and Judge Catell on the D.C. Circuit. Thank you for joining us, Ms. Stetson, and the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF CATHERINE E. STETSON, PARTNER, HOGAN AND HARTSON, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Ms. STETSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Kate Stetson. I am a partner in the law firm of Hogan and Hartson and I am here today to speak in strong support of the nomination

of my friend and my former colleague, Judge John Roberts, to be Chief Justice of the United States.
You have heard many times over of the Judge’s unsurpassed skill as an advocate. I can speak to that issue, as well, but I don’t believe you need to hear that from me today. What I would like to do instead is talk to you about my personal experience working for the Judge and his role in guiding me from early in my legal career through partnership in my firm.
I came to Hogan and Hartson as an associate in 1997, after those two judicial clerkships. Those clerkships both gave me a deep appreciation for good advocacy, but I grew up as a lawyer on Judge Roberts’s watch. It was my 6 years working for him at Hogan and Hartson, first as an associate and then as his law partner, that taught me to be an advocate.
No one could have had a better teacher, but having a mentor and not just a teacher is equally important to any young lawyer’s career and Judge Roberts was a mentor to me, as well. He counseled me on matters I handled for clients. He acted as a mock judge for moot courts that I held before my oral arguments. He demanded a lot from me, he praised me, and he supported me unstintingly.
I will give you just one example. Several years ago, I gave my first D.C. Circuit argument. Judge Roberts came and he sat in the audience and watched, and after the argument was over, he and I walked back together from the courthouse to our offices, as we often had done after the Judge’s own oral arguments, and together we discussed and dissected the panel’s questions and my answers. I will remember that day and that long walk for a long time.
Judge Roberts mentored me in less tangible ways, as well. I watched him for years interact with colleagues and staff at the firm, no matter what their position, always in the same decent, gentlemanly way. Whether he was dealing with clients or with adversaries, he was unfailingly courteous, never strident, never engaging in the luster that so often characterizes discourse among lawyers. I learned a lot from him in those more subtle respects, as well.
Five years ago, Judge Roberts and his wife, Jane, adopted their two children, Josephine and Jack. In that same year, my husband and I had our first child, as well, so all four of us learned at the same time what a delightful, chaotic, sometimes frustrating, and always joyful thing it is to be a parent.
When I came back to Hogan and Hartson after maternity leave, I faced the difficult challenge of being a new mother and a law firm associate. The transition back to work is hard for any working mother, and I was no different in that regard. But the transition back to working with Judge Roberts was seamless. We just picked up where I had left off a few months before. Judge Roberts never questioned the balance I chose to strike between my obligations to my family and to my colleagues and clients at the firm. He supported me in both of those roles and he did it quietly and without fanfare.
At the end of the year 2001, I was being considered for partnership at my firm. I had taken a few months of maternity leave that year. I was also an associate working on a part-time schedule. Now, either of those considerations might have impeded my pro-

motion to partnership at another firm. Neither of those considerations mattered to Judge Roberts or to my firm. What mattered to Judge Roberts was that I was a good lawyer. And so with his strong support, I became a partner at Hogan and Hartson at the end of that year.
Now, by the time the Judge left for the D.C. Circuit bench, we had worked on many matters together, issues as diverse and arcane as patent appeals, ERISA briefs, energy cases, preemption issues. The issues that we dealt with varied widely from week to week and from case to case, but a few things were constant—the Judge’s keen intellect, prodigious beyond description, his depth of preparation for every case, his kind and quiet sense of humor, and his devotion to the law.
No one is more dedicated and more devoted to the law than Judge Roberts. It was my honor to work for him for several years and it is my honor to appear before you today to speak on his behalf. Thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Stetson. [The prepared statement of Ms. Stetson appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Our next witness is Ms. Marcia Greenberger, founder and Co-President of the National Women’s Law Center, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, both Bachelor’s and law degree. She practiced with the Washington firm Kaplan and Drysdale, had been Director of the Women’s Rights Project of the Center for Law and Social Policy, which became the National Women’s Law Center. She is also on the Executive Committee of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. Thank you for being with us today, Ms. Greenberger, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF MARCIA GREENBERGER, CO-PRESIDENT, NATIONAL WOMEN’S LAW CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Ms. GREENBERGER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I am Marcia Greenberger, Co-President of the National Women’s Law Center, which since 1972 has been involved in virtually every major effort to secure and defend women’s legal rights in this country. We were directly involved, as a result, in many of the battles to save women’s rights that Judge Roberts worked to undermine.
I thank you for your invitation to testify and ask that my written statement and attached report be made a part of the record.
Some have claimed that because Judge Roberts has been so supportive of women family members and friends and wonderful colleagues that he must also support women’s legal rights. But Judge Roberts’s record consists of document after document detailing his past work to undermine women’s legal rights on the job, in schools, and in government programs.
This week, Judge Roberts told Senator Feinstein he could not identify anything he would change in his writings and memoranda except the tone he used in support for limiting life tenure for judges. Judge Roberts provided a clear explanation for this seeming contradiction. He testified that he forms his legal views without regard to his life experiences, and this is his quote, ‘‘a father, husband, or anything else,’’ end quote. Unfortunately, John Roberts’s

491
view of the law is entirely divorced from its real-world consequences on women’s lives.
In contrast to Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, who said that, quote, ‘‘The life of the law is not logic but experience,’’ for Judge Roberts, the law is pure logic, untempered by life experience.
The Christine Franklin case discussed again this morning demonstrates why his judicial philosophy is so harmful. As a high school student, her teacher and coach sexually harassed and ultimately raped her. Judge Roberts said he did not condone the behavior, and I am sure he did not, but that is not the point. As the political Deputy Solicitor General, he argued that Title IX should be interpreted to preclude her, and indeed any student, from recovering even one cent of damages, no matter how severe her injuries or how egregious the discrimination.
He said students could still recover back pay or get the court to order the sexual abuse to stop in the future, but high school students aren’t paid by their schools, and by the time their cases get through the courts, they have often graduated, as had Christine Franklin, so they can’t benefit from a court order that a school protect its students in the future.
His argument on the law would have let schools off scot free and left students without effective protection or any remedy for the serious injuries they suffer. The Supreme Court rejected this extreme limitation on Title IX nine-to-nothing, and pressed repeatedly by Senator Leahy today to say the legal positions he argued were wrong now in retrospect, Judge Roberts repeatedly refused to do so. At most, he said he had, quote, ‘‘no cause or agenda to revisit it or any quarrel with it,’’ end quote.
Of course, a nine-to-nothing decision is not one likely to be revisited. As for having no quarrel with it, that is a careful formulation we have heard time and again in past confirmation hearings. Justice Thomas used it, for example, in discussing the Establishment Clause under the Lemon test, which he attacked once on the Court. He explained, in answer to a question at his hearing, that having no quarrel with a ruling does not mean that he agrees with it.
On women’s constitutional rights and equal protection of the law, Judge Roberts testified that he now believes courts must give heightened scrutiny to government practices that discriminate on the basis of sex. But Judge Roberts gave no guidance as to which version of heightened scrutiny he would apply, one that gives meaningful protection to women against sex discrimination, as Justice O’Connor and the majority of the Court have applied to date, or the Thomas-Scalia version that provides little real protection to women. His written record reinforces our concern on this point.
The very same concern applies to the right to privacy and the future of Roe v. Wade. Like Justice Thomas during his confirmation hearing, Judge Roberts said that there is a right to privacy and it applies to the marital relationship and the use of contraceptives in that context, but he refused to say how much further its protection would go. For Justice Thomas, we know the answer is not very far. In his first year on the court, he said Roe v. Wade should be overturned and later said there is no general right to privacy at all. John Roberts refused to say he disagreed with Justice Thomas in any way.

Judge Roberts has refused to disavow his past record. We don’t have the Solicitor General records on the Franklin case or others. He said many times he believes in judicial restraint, but unfortunately, what we see from the record and from his testimony is that he has been restrained in protecting individual rights and freedoms but unrestrained when he has been seeking to narrow them and that is what led the National Women’s Law Center to oppose his confirmation, because we so fear turning back the clock for all Americans and most especially women and the risks are simply too high. Thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Greenberger appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mrs. Greenberger. Our next witness is Mayor Bruce Botelho, Mayor of Juno, Alaska. He has served as State’s Attorney General. He has been a distinguished Chairman of many of the Commissions on Criminal Justice and Youth; undergrad and law degrees from Willamette University. Thanks for joining us, Mr. Mayor, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF HON. BRUCE BOTELHO, MAYOR OF JUNEAU, ALASKA AND FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF ALASKA, JUNEAU, ALASKA
Mayor BOTELHO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a distinct honor to appear before this Committee to support Judge Roberts’s confirmation to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, that is, his nomination. I do so not only as a public official who has observed his work up close, but also as a liberal Democrat whose views on several social issues are likely at odds with the majority of this Committee. I came to know Judge Roberts while serving as Alaska’s Attorney General. In January of 1997 I first hired John to represent the State in an Indian law case that we had lost before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Roberts prepared our petition for cert, which was granted. He subsequently briefed and successfully argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court. We ultimately retained him on 8 appellate matters over the course of the following 7 years. I had the opportunity to work closely with Judge Roberts on these cases of immense importance to my State, and it is on the basis of this working relationship that I urge confirmation of Judge Roberts. Mr. Chairman, I was struck by the eloquence, without exception, of the opening statements offered by members of this Committee on Monday, but it was Senator Kohl’s personal test for confirmation that particularly resonated with me. Aside from candor, Senator Kohl said that he would look for a person who is competent, has strong character and judicial temperament, someone who knows the law and can explain it to the common person. He would look for a person who has compassion for real people who are affected by the Court’s decisions, and he said he would look for a person who understands the fundamental values of this Nation.

493
In applying Senator Kohl’s approach, I offer this brief perspective on Judge Roberts. As you have all heard repeatedly, Judge Roberts possesses extraordinary legal skills. His briefs are technically perfect. They are clear, persuasive, and they are a pleasure to read. His writing style is one that is reachable by our citizens. Likewise, his oral presentation and argument style is straightforward, responsive and conversational.
Judge Roberts is a modest, respectful, polite and eminently approachable person. He has remarkable ability to engage people of our backgrounds.
I have two anecdotes I would share with you. The first, in order to get a better understanding of the issues in a submerged land case that existed between the State and Federal Governments, he decided that he wanted to explore the area. I recall with a great deal of fondness his interaction with the crew members of a small State Fish and Game vessel as we plied the waters of southeast Alaska. He was intensely interested in the crew as persons, in what they did, what they thought, and particularly their sense of the land and water surrounding us. He truly made them feel that they were part of a team.
And as an aside, Judge Roberts’s decision to spend time traveling to southeast Alaska was emblematic of his passion for learning everything there was to know about a case, not just to know the law, but to know the facts firsthand. That is the first example.
The second one a little more personal and more recent. Early this summer, I contacted Judge Roberts and asked him whether he would be willing to meet with a group of Boy Scouts on their way to the National Jamboree just as part of their trip. He immediately agreed to do so. The night that his nomination was announced in July, I e-mailed him to give him both my congratulations and to tell him that I understood that under the circumstances he had better fish to fry than meet with my troop. His reply, which was sent at 2:00 a.m., began, ‘‘Nonsense. I can think of no more valuable use of my time.’’ He met with these young men for nearly an hour and he focused on them in a way that made them feel that they were the most important people in the world at the moment. And their collective evaluation, Mr. Chairman, was ‘‘He’s a pretty good guy.’’
Judge Roberts works collaboratively. He always sought out views and our critique at every stage of preparation. He delighted in engaging and dialogue with my staff, and made clear his willingness to learn from, as well as to teach his clients. This collaborative approach to problem solving will be particularly valuable on the Supreme Court.
Finally, Judge Roberts has an unparalleled reverence for the role of the law and justice in our society. He was always faithful to the text and context of the law. His judgment and common sense were exquisite. He did not enter the debate on any case we presented him with a predetermined outcome or view. He subjected ideas to rigorous examination to reach logical sound conclusions based on the facts and the law. While he, like all of us, may hold personal views on a wide range of subjects, Judge Roberts has the capacity to approach every issue with a freshness and openness. He will de-

cide cases, not causes, and he will declare the law as reason and justice lead him.
Working with Judge Roberts, I was fortunate to get to know the most remarkable and inspiring lawyer I have ever met. He will lead the Court in a way that will instill public confidence in the fairness, justice and wisdom of its judiciary.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much. Our next witness is Mr. Roderick Jackson, the plaintiff in Jackson v. Birmingham Board of Education, a Title IX case. He complained about inadequate funding for women’s sports, and was the object of retaliation. A graduate of the University of Alabama and Alabama State, he is currently the Acting Head Coach of a girls basketball team at Ensley High School. Thank you for coming in, Plaintiff Jackson.
STATEMENT OF RODERICK JACKSON, COACH, ENSLEY HIGH SCHOOL, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA
Mr. JACKSON. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. My name is Roderick Jackson, and it is truly a privilege and honor to be here today, and I ask that you include my full statement for the record.
Chairman SPECTER. It will be made a part of the record, without objection.
Mr. JACKSON. It is hard for me to believe that I am actually here. I am just a teacher and Acting Head Coach of the Ensley High School girls basketball team in Birmingham, Alabama.
But my story shows the impact that the Supreme Court can have on the lives of regular citizens and how key a role the Court plays in making sure that our civil rights laws truly guarantee fair treatment for all.
I was born and raised in Birmingham, where I early on learned the value of taking responsibility for myself, my family and those in my charge. My father died when I was 2-years-old, so I had to help support the family, working my way through school all the way through graduate school. Other than the 6 years that I served in Army Reserves, I have spent my life in that community where I grew up.
From 1999 until May of 2001 I was the Head Coach of the girls basketball team at Ensley High School. We had a good team. The girls worked hard and they won many games. Six of my seniors actually received scholarships out of 7. But my team was not treated fairly. The girls had to practice in the outdated, unheated old gym with lumpy floors, while the boys practiced in the new regulationsize gymnasium. My team did not get enough funds to pay for buses to away games or equipment that we needed. We could not get access to basic things like ice when a player became injured.
To me this was just unfair, and I also thought it was against the law. So I did what I thought was the right thing. I went through the chain of command at my school in the school district and asked for equal treatment of my team.
The school ignored the unfairness. Instead of fixing the problems, they fired me from my coaching job. Being fired was the beginning

of a tough period for me. I not only lost the satisfaction of coaching, I also lost the extra income I would have earned.
I was labeled a troublemaker, a rabble rouser, and for 2–1/2 years I was turned down for every other coaching position that I applied for, and the young ladies at Ensley, more importantly, lost the only person that was willing to stand up for them.
So I went to court to try to get my job back, and with the help of the National Women’s Law Center and the law firm of O’Melveny and Myers, I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court.
The Court, in a 5–4 decision written by Justice O’Connor, made clear that Title IX and laws like it were intended to protect people like me and my girls.
I came to Washington for the argument. It was truly a thrill. I felt like Justice O’Connor was looking straight at me right in the courtroom. In her opinion, she said that prohibiting retaliation against those who protest discrimination is essential to realizing the goals of the law. This decision and my involvement in this case had a significant impact on me, and I hope on others as well. The Court’s decision sends a message that teachers and others like me can stand up for what is right when we recognize discrimination and bring it forward without being penalized as a result. In fact, people come up to me on the street in Birmingham almost weekly and thank me for what I did. But the decision could have easily gone the other way. A shift in even one vote would have left me without any remedy. That is why today’s hearing and the Supreme Court confirmation process is so important to people like me.
Like many Americans, I have had a chance to follow some of the coverage and read up on the proceedings with great interest. I have heard and read a lot that raises questions about whether Judge Roberts would act to protect my rights or for those young ladies that I represent. Like Judge Roberts, I have a son and a daughter, and I will insist at every turn that my daughter have equal citizenship rights with her brother. But as I have learned the hard way, sometimes we need help from the Supreme Court to make sure you can do that.
I hope that this Committee will vote to confirm nominees who understand the key role of the Supreme Court in protecting civil rights, who recognize the significant impact of their decisions on everyday lives, and who will help to continue to make the promise of the law a reality.
I thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Jackson appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Jackson. Our next witness is Ms. Henrietta Wright, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center. She worked full-time on President Carter’s campaign staff in 1976, then for the Democratic National Committee; Yale grad, both B.A. and law degree, where she was on the Journal; now of counsel to the Goldberg law firm. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Wright, and we look forward to your testimony.

STATEMENT OF HENRIETTA WRIGHT, OF COUNSEL, GOLDBERG, GODLES, WIENER AND WRIGHT, AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, DALLAS CHILDREN’S ADVOCACY CENTER, DALLAS, TEXAS
Ms. WRIGHT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. I am not here today to discuss—
Senator BIDEN. May I ask a procedural question? Excuse the interruption. Are they going to hold the vote for us?
Chairman SPECTER. The vote is scheduled to be held until 5 minutes to 4:00, so we are on a tight time schedule, but the answer is yes.
Senator BIDEN. The power of a Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Ms. WRIGHT. I will talk quickly. Senator BIDEN. No, no, no. Take your time. I just wanted to make sure. Ms. WRIGHT. I am not here today to discuss Judge Roberts’s judicial opinions or his political views. Instead, I hope to give you some insight into John Roberts, the man, whom I have had the privilege and pleasure of knowing for almost 20 years. The President could not have made a better choice for Chief Justice of the United States. I am a life-long Democrat. I served in President Carter’s White House, working for Sarah Weddington. My political views have not disqualified me from being in John’s close circle of friends. He himself does not have a doctrinaire approach to life. One of the things I have liked most about John is that he has always been supportive of women and aware of the many difficult choices that some of us have faced. As his wife, Jane, and I made the long march to law firm partnership and motherhood, he was unstinting in his encouragement. When Jane or I had successes in our Washington law practices, John applauded them. When my daughter, Sierra, turned 3 and I decided to become a full-time volunteer, he understood and supported the reasons for that decision as well. John is definitely a man who respects smart women. His wife has two more degrees than he does. John’s support of Jane’s work is constant and genuine. As but one of thousands of examples, recently when Jane’s family in New York held a celebration on the same day that she needed to be away on law firm business, John dressed and packed the children for the trip, drove them to New York, and spent several days at Sullivan family functions as a single parent, thinking nothing of it. John is truly a lawyer’s lawyer. His intellectual curiosity, especially about the law, is immense. He and I are both long-time members of the American Law Institute and have been together at many of those functions over the years. As you have seen demonstrated this week, he is capable of intelligently discussing any area of law that comes up. John is a very likable, congenial person, and the Court will benefit from his persuasive ability and tact. It is not a given that lawyers, especially super-smart ones, have good social skills. Maybe as Chief Justice, John can help the Court produce greater consensus

in its opinion. He will also bring a dry, often self-deprecating wit to the proceedings.
I laughed and groaned to see articles picking apart a flippant sentence John wrote when he was much younger about whether homemakers should be encouraged to become lawyers. I could hear the smile in his voice when I read these remarks and felt certain that he had found a way to tell a lawyer joke on himself.
How someone handles disappointments in life says a lot about them. John and Jane went through considerable effort and anguish to have children, sometimes wondering if, as prospective first-time parents in their 40’s, it would ever happen. It took a long time to arrange the first adoption, and it fell through just days before the baby was due to come home with them. Rather than being angry or devastated, John and Jane remained calm and positive.
Career disappointments came, too. John’s first two nominations to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit were not acted on by the Senate. For 11 years, he never showed any bitterness about it. Instead, he appeared to relish the challenge of his years in private practice.
John seemed perfectly accepting of the possibility that he would never become a judge. But if merit truly determined judicial appointments, it could only be a matter of time before he would be on the bench, and even on the Supreme Court.
What do all of these highly personal impressions of John indicate for this Committee’s consideration of him as a nominee? I have known John in many unguarded personal, private moments. I can assure you and the American people that what you see here and the man I have known is the Justice you will get. John Roberts is smart, tolerant, collegial, of even temperament, and loves the law.
From my experience, John Roberts has no agenda other than to apply the law as it is written. It will be a great credit to this Committee and to the rest of the Senate for his nomination to be speedily approved.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Wright appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Wright. I have just been informed that a number of our colleagues have plane reservations, and they want to leave while we want to stay. So we are going to recess now, and we will be back shortly after the vote. [Recess from 3:46 to 4:17 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume. The good news is that there are no more votes this afternoon, so we will not be interrupted again. Our final witness on this panel is Ms. Beverly Jones, Lafayette, Tennessee, one of the two plaintiffs in Lane v. Tennessee. Ms. Jones is a graduate of Tennessee State University, is a certified court reporter, more than 15 years of court reporting experience. She has a mobility impairment, and she filed suit under Title II of the ADA against Tennessee, and she got the Court on a good day. It was 5– 4 for her, unlike Garrett, which was 5–4 the other way. Thank you from joining us, Ms. Jones, and we will be very much interested to hear what happened to you and your testimony.

STATEMENT OF BEVERLY JONES, LAFAYETTE, TENNESSEE
Ms. JONES. Thank you, Chairman Specter and members of the Judiciary Committee. My name is Beverly Jones, and even though Chairman Specter pronounced it LA-fayette, where I am from, it’s La-FAY-ette, Tennessee. And I would like to thank the Committee for inviting me to testify in these confirmation proceedings.
If John Roberts is confirmed as Chief Justice, his decisions will impact the lives of Americans for decades to come. I hope that as you deliberate on his nomination, you will not underestimate the importance his role and decisions will have on everyone, including people like me.
If I may, Mr. Chairman, I would like to share with you the importance that the Constitution, the law, and the Supreme Court have had on my life, and for my rights as a person with a disability. I was a plaintiff in Tennessee v. Lane, a case that went up to the Supreme Court concerning the rights of people with disabilities to have access to the courts. The Supreme Court took the case to decide whether it could enforce the rights that Congress gave people like me under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
When Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, it found that individuals with disabilities, and I quote, ‘‘have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness’’ based on inaccurate stereotypes.
On July 26, 1990, when President George H.W. Bush signed the law, he affirmed this finding and declared that, just as we tore down the Berlin Wall to free the people of Eastern Europe, we would tear down the barriers that keep people with disabilities from participating in society. For me the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act was like opening a door that had been closed for so long.
I lost my ability to walk due to an automobile accident in 1984 and have used a wheelchair since that time. At the time I became disabled, I decided that I would not allow what I wanted in life to be denied because of my physical limitations. At the time of my accident, I was a wife and mother, but had little education and limited job skills. A local judge and attorney encouraged me to look into becoming a court reporter, and from there my ambitions began.
I completed court reporting school the year that the ADA was passed. But to my surprise, when I began my first assignment, I found that I could not get into many of Tennessee’s courtrooms and courthouses because they were inaccessible to people who used wheelchairs. I was forced to turn down jobs or face humiliating experiences.
Approximately seven out of ten courthouses in Tennessee were inaccessible when I filed my suit. In some cases, I could not even get in the door. In the years following the passage of the ADA, some courthouses became more accessible, but even in 1998, when my lawsuit was filed, a number of the courthouses I worked in remained inaccessible to me.
Courtrooms were located only on upper floors and reachable only by climbing stairs. I was often forced to ask complete strangers to carry me up the stairs or into rooms, including nonaccessible rest-

rooms. This experience was humiliating and frightening. But as a single mom supporting myself and two kids, I could not afford to quit my job or strictly limit my work to accessible courthouses.
After the passage of the ADA, I worked tirelessly to bring the law to the attention of public officials throughout Tennessee and to encourage them to follow the law’s requirements to make public buildings, including courthouses, accessible.
Because the State of Tennessee challenged the constitutionality of the ADA, my case went through the courts for 6 years without any court reaching the substance of my claims. In 2004, my case reached the United States Supreme Court, which voted by a 5–4 margin to uphold my right to enforce the Americans with Disabilities Act’s protections.
Many changes have been made in Tennessee as a result of the ruling, and I am now able to do my job with much greater ease and without humiliation or danger. My case is over. But what I have been able to accomplish with the help of Congress is not the end of the issue. For me it would be a hollow victory to see Tennessee v. Lane as the end of the road. There are too many others who need the protections of the law and the Constitution.
In fact, Congress’s power to enact the ADA will be considered again on November 9, 2005, when the Supreme Court will hear a case called Goodman v. Georgia. This case involves a man who is in prison in Georgia and is a paraplegic, just as I am. He requires a wheelchair to move about. This man is confined in a 12-foot-by3-foot cell for 23 to 24 hours a day because of the inaccessibility of the prison facilities. He has to sleep in his wheelchair because his bed is inaccessible, and he has suffered broken bones because of his attempts to transfer from his wheelchair.
On November 9th, the Court will consider whether Congress has the power to ensure that this man will be permitted to access the same services as every other prisoner in that facility. Just as I do not know Judge Roberts, I do not know Tony Goodman. I do not know if he is a good person or a bad person. But that is not the point. All I know is that just as I should not have had to endure the humiliation, embarrassment, fear, and pain that I did for more than 14 years, he should not either. And if John Roberts is confirmed to Chief Justice, he must know that there are many others like Tony Goodman who need the protection of the law.
If confirmed, the role that Judge Roberts will play in defining the boundaries of the Constitution and the power of Congress to protect citizens just like me is critical. It is my hope that the Senate will carefully review the record of John Roberts to determine if he is committed to the protection of the rights and freedoms of every American.
I am not here today as an expert on John Roberts’s record. I am here today to tell my story. But I do know that there are many within the disabled community who believe that John Roberts’s record with respect to disability rights raises serious concerns. I understand that John Roberts has advocated that the Americans with Disabilities Act should be narrowly interpreted to protect only the so-called truly disabled. Because my case involved Congress’s power to enact the Americans with Disabilities Act, I understand just how important it is to ensure that the judges on our courts re-

spect Congress’s authority to provide protections that are so desperately needed. Without the protections that Congress guaranteed in the Americans with Disabilities Act, my life and the lives of millions of others with disabilities would be a lot harder.
For all of these reasons, I urge the Senate to pay close attention to whether John Roberts has proven that he would ensure that the rights that people with disabilities fought so hard to secure are not stripped away.
Members of the Senate, I hope that you will give John Roberts’s record very careful scrutiny before voting on his nomination. I hope that the rights of millions of Americans with disabilities are important enough to merit that type of careful consideration.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Jones appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Jones, for your very poignant story. As I had said earlier, we have many, many witnesses today. We still have 12 more witnesses to hear. And while there are many questions which would be very fruitful, when we divided up the witnesses, 15 for the Democrats and 15 for the Republicans, we wanted to bring on as many people as we could to hear your stories and see your faces and take your pulse and see the quality of your testimony and passion, both for and against. But I am not going to ask any questions. I am just going to make one observation. As to your case, Ms. Jones, I had a chance to talk to your lawyer, and there is very strong sentiment in this Congress on both sides of the aisle to protect Americans with disabilities. Senator Dole, who is not with us any longer, has been a real leader, but people on this dais now were very instrumental in that legislation. And we are not going to let the Supreme Court get away with congruence and proportionality. Your lawyer is nodding in the affirmative. I think that point was made fairly emphatically so that congressional will reflecting the people and having very important social programs will be carried out. Senator Leahy, do you have questions? Senator LEAHY. I don’t have a question, but just to say this, Mr. Chairman. One, I applaud what you said, but when I voted for the Americans with Disabilities Act, I voted for the Act that I expected would be enforced. I voted for an Act that would open those doors. I voted for the Act so that Beverly Jones could go to work and others could, and one of my dearest friends who spends his life in a wheelchair, that he can go anywhere he wants. And if you knew him, you would know he wants to go where he wants. We will keep on working to make sure it is enforced. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator. Senator LEAHY. That wasn’t an empty gesture to vote for it. We want an Act that is actually going to work, and Republicans and Democrats alike joined hands on that one. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch, questions? Senator HATCH. Yes. Ms. Jones, I managed the bill on the floor for our side, and was one of the prime authors, so we are on your side on this.

Ms. JONES. Thank you. Senator HATCH. The Supreme Court is one thing, we are another, and we will surely try to make sure that your rights are protected. I just have one question for you, Ms. Greenberger, and that is, has your organization ever endorsed a Republican nominee for the Supreme Court? Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, our organization actually rarely takes positions. In fact, the very first time we ever— Senator HATCH. Have you ever been in favor of a Republican nominee—maybe I should put it that way—for the Supreme Court? Ms. GREENBERGER. We have rarely taken a position period, and I do not think that is probably—I do not think we have. Senator HATCH. I do not either. Ms. GREENBERGER. On the other hand, there are a number of Republican nominees for the Supreme Court that we have not opposed, and of course, many women’s organizations that are a part in the coalition, were very strong supporters of Sandra Day O’Connor’s nomination. At that period in our history we had not ever taken a position with respect to a judicial nomination and did not up until the late ‘80’s. I think what we learned over time as an organization that is so involved with the courts, is that when we work on legislation like Title IX or we try to represent clients like Mr. Jackson, if the judges are hostile and do not have the kind of open mind that we are looking for, whatever their political persuasion may be, then there really is not the sense of justice at the end of the day, and those legal rights do not really matter. Senator HATCH. I think whether they are Republicans or Democrats, they ought to have an open mind on women’s issues. I do not think there is any question about that. Ms. GREENBERGER. Absolutely. Senator HATCH. Your organization is closely affiliated with the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women as well? Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, we are a member of the Alliance. The National Organization for Women is an organization that we have worked with on a range of different issues, like many, many different types of organizations of all different sorts over the many years that we have worked, whether it is involving child care or involving some of the issues where, Senator Hatch, you have been a strong supporter, like child care. Senator HATCH. I think it does some good. Let me ask you this. What I am trying to get to is do you know of any Republican, let us just say from Chief Justice Rehnquist, when he was nominated for Chief Justice, on through till today, who your organization, Alliance for Justice or NOW has ever supported or has ever found to be worthy of being on the Supreme Court? Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, I cannot speak for those two organizations, but I know that there are a number of Republican judges over time who have been some of the strongest supporters for civil rights and women’s rights. There has been a very proud tradition, a bipartisan tradition of justice and equity over the Nation’s history that has not been limited by party. And that is certainly what I would hope that we would be able to see in the future.

In fact, we had not taken a position with respect to John Roberts for his Court of Appeals nomination, and did so this time, only as I said in my prepared testimony, because when we looked at the record that was available to us, we were honestly taken aback at how many of the core women’s legal rights that are at the heart of our mission he had worked to narrow, and that is what led us to take the position, not his—not his party affiliation, not the administration that nominated him.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to first of all, Beverly Jones, I want to thank you. This is not an easy task to go out and talk about some of the physical challenges that you have had over the course of your life, but it is an extraordinary story and it has to be one that gives people great, great inspiration. It is just a really impressive story, and you deserve enormous credit for your own courage and perseverance. It is interesting to know that there were four judges in the Supreme Court—even realizing the language that you read correctly from the ADA—that did not decide your way. And I can only imaging what your life would have been like if it had been 5. Just a question about how much sort of discrimination or lack of understanding is out there with regard to people with disabilities that still needs addressing? Not that we can answer all of the problems or challenges, but how much of this do you still see out there? Do you want to make just a brief comment about the progress we are making or how far we still have to go? Ms. JONES. Just briefly. I have used a wheelchair for 21 years, and I have seen great improvements, not only in Tennessee but across the country. However, there is still a lack of understanding, and I think a lot of it is people’s lack of exposure to people with disabilities. I think I bring that to the table as far as an understanding because I was a person without a disability for 20 years. So I understand what people do not understand because until I was put in that position and became that person with the disability, I was not forced to look at it. So I think a lot of the problems out there today are based on just people not being exposed to people with disabilities for the most part. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Coach Jackson, I thank you so much for being here. I wanted to ask you—and admire you for your own courage in protesting the discrimination against young women. What would have been the impact if the Supreme Court had dismissed your case instead of recognizing that you had a right to challenge the retaliation against you? Mr. JACKSON. Thank you for that question, Senator Kennedy. I think if the decision had went the other way, I think that decision would have sent a message to school systems and school boards across the Nation that it is okay to retaliate against persons who bring discrimination claims against the system. It would have been a big setback I think to not only Title IX and athletics, but also the other civil rights laws and anti-discrimination laws.

503
Senator KENNEDY. You think young women still are facing discrimination in sports today, colleges? Give us a quick thumbnail sketch.
Mr. JACKSON. There is no doubt in my mind that discrimination is still out there, even for persons who represent young ladies. For example, when you are a girls coach, it is even hard to move over to the boys position if it opens and if you apply for it. So once you are labeled a quote, ‘‘girls coach,’’ it is like it is a step down and it should not be that way in my opinion.
Senator KENNEDY. Marcia Greenberger, you mentioned that Roberts’s statement in a memo that it is a canard that women are discriminated against because they receive 59 cents for every dollar earned by men. Is there any justification for Roberts’s assertion that such a wide pay gap between men and women is not evidence of discrimination against women?
Ms. GREENBERGER. There have been many studies. Of course, that was a statement that was made approximately 20 years ago, and I think if you asked most women in the country 20 years ago, was part of the pay gap due, at least part of the pay gap due to discrimination, I think they would say yes, I think their husbands would say yes too.
We have made progress, no question about it, but I think if you ask husbands or wives, men or women today, do they still see a problem of equal pay for women, the answer would be yes, and definitely a piece of that is still unfortunately sex discrimination. And it is not just a question of asking people. Studies have shown, from 20 years ago up until today, including Government studies, that an aspect of the pay gap can only be explained by discrimination.
Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Kyl. Senator KYL. Mr. Chairman, I think all of us would like to both compliment these witnesses for their testimony, and also ask questions. In the interest of time I will not do that. I just would make one observation. It is obvious that from the testimony that he gave, we cannot know how Judge Roberts would vote in cases that are going to come before him, but in law there is something called the best evidence rule. And perhaps the best evidence of the kind of person that Judge Roberts is, is illustrated by the testimony, for example, of Ms. Stetson, who talked about her role as a young mother, and an aspiring partner in a law firm, a person that he helped to mentor. And I think the kinds of things that she talked about in Judge Roberts as a person should not be forgotten by us when we consider the nature of the man that we are elevating to the United States Supreme Court. It may be the best evidence of the way that he will rule on cases as well. I certainly hope so. I thank all of you for your testimony here. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kyl. Senator Biden. Senator BIDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This is an impressive panel, all of them.

504
You know, I may be mistaken, but I think other than Senator Kennedy, I voted for or against more Supreme Court Justices than anybody here, other than three other Senators on this panel. It has been an evolving process for me trying to figure out the right thing to do over the last 33 years.
I came to the conclusion about 10 years—well, that is not true— 17 years ago, that there is only three ways I can decide to vote my hopes or my fears. One is that, do I know people well who know the nominee well? For example, when the former Supreme Court Justice from New Hampshire came up, I was one of the few Democrats who immediately strongly supported him and pushed in the Republican administration because there were four people, one a Republican Governor of New Hampshire and two others. One is now the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, a Democrat. The other was a Federal Judge from New Hampshire, a Democrat, and the third is another Democrat who heads up the National Education Association.
They all came down to see me, and they said, ‘‘Look, we share a vacation home with him on Lake Winnepesaukah, I tell you this guy’s a straight guy, this guy doesn’t have an agenda.’’ And even though he did not have much of a record, that convinced me that I should vote my hopes. I am glad I did.
There is another way to look at it. You can look at what they have written and make your judgment based on that if you do not have any evidence on the first score.
And the third is, you look at what they say when they come before the Committee. I have been impressed by you, Ms. Stetson, as well as you, Ms. Wright, because I wish I knew you both better because you obviously care very much about this judge and you think he is going to be basically a mainstream, decent, honorable guy who will not take a narrow view of the Constitution. So it is worthwhile for me—the reason I am taking the time is to tell you that.
Also, what concerns me, I am very impressed by the testimony of Mr. Jackson and Ms. Jones, because you illustrate what is at stake here, what is at stake. And Ms. Greenberger sort of lays out the problem.
I submit for the record, Mr. Chairman, a series of questions I asked in this hearing of the Justice—of Judge Roberts, and he used the same language that Judge Thomas used with me. He said, ‘‘I have no quarrel with the majority opinion.’’ And I would press him and say, ‘‘Well, do you agree or don’t agree? ’’ And he would say, ‘‘Well, I can’t comment on that.’’ Well, that is the same position that Judge Thomas took.
To give you an illustration of how fundamentally different that is, I am going to conclude by pointing out how different it would be in Mr. Jackson’s case. In that case, writing for the minority opinion, Justice Thomas stated, ‘‘We require Congress to speak unambiguously in imposing conditions on funding recipients through its spending power, i.e., we didn’t speak clearly enough, therefore, you can be fired.’’
Now, Justice O’Connor, a Republican appointee taking the same exact language said, and I quote, ‘‘Our repeated holdings constitute discrimination under Title IX broadly,’’ broadly, and she reached a different result.

505
So I just raise for the panel and for anyone who is listening that the situation of Ms. Jones and Mr. Jackson and millions of people like them across America depend on things like whether or not it must be unambiguous, the language, as it is applied, or it must be applied broadly. That is the difference between life and death. That is the difference between freedom and lack of freedom. That is the difference between autonomy and no respect for autonomy. That is the difference between having the right to be let alone, as one famous Justice once said, and allowing the government to intrude into your life.
That is the decision I have to make, all of us have to make, and I must tell you, absent the testimony of you, Ms. Stetson, and you, Ms. Wright, I didn’t think there was any prospect I could make it, but I have great respect for both of you, but I must tell you, I am— it comes down to that difference among honorable, decent, proud women and men who serve on the Court.
My question is, is Justice Roberts going to be a Scalia, a Rehnquist, or maybe a Kennedy? If I think he is going to be a Justice Scalia, who I like personally very much, I vote no. If I think he is going to be a Kennedy, I vote yes. If I think he is going to be a Rehnquist, I probably vote yes because it won’t change anything.
But anyway, thank you for your testimony. It is helping me be more confused.
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Biden. Senator DeWine? Senator DEWINE. I have no questions, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. I am sorry I missed much of this testimony, but I was just trying to read your brief, Ms. Greenberger and it is too much to digest quickly. It is a very impressive document. But I was reading part of it and I wanted to ask you this question. Did you not think that the discussion on Roe with Senator Specter in particular, the discussion on Griswold and Casey, the discussion on stare decisis and reliance and the fact that Roe had been in place for 32 years and the findings of Griswold and Casey with respect to Roe, workability, that as Senator Specter has said, that super-precedent is really in play? I think I even heard him once say super-duper precedent. Could that be? Chairman SPECTER. I said super-duper in the context of some 38 occasions when the Court has had the Roe issue before it and they could have overruled Roe had they decided to do so— Senator FEINSTEIN. Right. Chairman SPECTER.—so it became a super-precedent. With the reaffirmation, it may become a super-duper or maybe even more, super-duper-duper— [Laughter.] Senator FEINSTEIN. Super-duper-duper— Chairman SPECTER.—38 times over. Senator FEINSTEIN. But— Chairman SPECTER. It has been a long hearing. [Laughter.]

506
Senator FEINSTEIN. I wanted to ask you, because you watch all of this very closely, from the time you wrote this, would you write the same thing after the hearing?
Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, if you could indulge me, I just want to say one thing and correct something I said incorrectly which was in answer to Senator Hatch’s question about whether—I hesitate to speak for other organizations, but I am pretty certain that the National Organization for Women actually did endorse Sandra Day O’Connor. He asked if any organizations, and specifically mentioned NOW, had ever endorsed a Republican nominee and I said I really didn’t know, but I am pretty close to sure that they did with respect to Sandra Day O’Connor.
But now to this very, quite important question that you asked, we listened very, very closely, hoping to find some reason to put our fears at rest, and, in fact, when we wrote that report, we said that it was contingent—our judgment there was contingent on what happened at the hearing.
Unfortunately, what I heard at the hearing was a very articulate explanation by Judge Roberts of what all the factors are to be considered when you look at a precedent of the Supreme Court, but no indication on his part of how he would apply those factors. And each time he was pressed about whether it was a super-duper precedent, whether he was asked about it in the context of Roe or asked about it in the context of Casey, he said, which reinforced the essential holdings of Roe—
Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me stop you. Ms. GREENBERGER.—as you well know— Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me stop you here. Ms. GREENBERGER. Yes. Senator FEINSTEIN. I think there was significance in the fact that he laid it out at all, because he didn’t have to do that. I didn’t really expect he would ever answer that question one way or another, and I think it is an unrealistic expectation. My interest was to see if he would be open to reviewing various things carefully and cautiously, or if he came in with a bias? We all grant that he is conservative, and there is nothing wrong with that. Ms. GREENBERGER. Of course. Senator FEINSTEIN. I mean, he is conservative. The nominee that I would anticipate from this President would have been really conservative, would have come in here and would have said what he was going to do and probably could have mustered the votes, but it would have been definitive. I don’t see anything that is definitive and I do see things that would allow one to believe that this is a fine legal scholar who will truly look at the law. I think he said he gave a serious regard to precedent. We pulled all his 50 cases. I can’t imagine what my weekend is going to be like, reading those. But in any event, comment on this for a minute. Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, I think that there has been a lot of discussion in the hearings about what it means to be a conservative Justice and the difference between being an active Justice who doesn’t have respect for precedent to the same degree as a true conservative Justice would. And so there is nothing wrong with being

507
a conservative Justice, and clearly, many are on the Supreme Court right now.
When you look at what happened with the confirmation hearings of other nominees to the Supreme Court, what emerged with a number and especially with Clarence Thomas, the pattern was to describe what the law was and what the holdings were and to spend a lot of time describing it, and certainly Judge Roberts is brilliant. Everyone has said it. It is beyond dispute, and so he is fully familiar and perfectly capable and extraordinarily able when he describes what the holdings of courts are with respect to how you treat precedent.
So yes, he did that in a magnificent way. But when it came time to give any sense of what he would do with all those factors, he used the same formulation that Justice Thomas did in not signaling in any way how he would actually apply those factors, and you very effectively asked him specifically about each of the factors. You broke each of those down. I remember your questioning very well. He agreed with you, because you did a lot of that work in identifying each of the factors you consider when you review precedents and he agreed that those were factors. Of course, he said he would look at them with an open mind. I would expect him to say nothing less.
But he never gave any indication at the end of the day, and, of course, we knew he wouldn’t, but in response to many other questions from those who may be holding out hope he would overturn Roe v. Wade, he gave them assurance, too, and that he did not feel bound by precedent and that there would be a lot of different ways of finally deciding.
And one of the—what I was struck by with Griswold, because you asked me about that, too—
Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Greenberger, could you summarize your thought here—
Ms. GREENBERGER. Okay. Chairman SPECTER.—because we are running way over. Ms. GREENBERGER. Okay. Sorry. What I was struck by—I will try to just do this in a sentence—with respect to Griswold, you went back actually just this morning and looked at his specific answers in comparison to Justice Thomas and it was absolutely eerie to see how close they were. Each one said they agreed with Griswold. Each one said they would not have a quarrel with Eisenstadt v. Baird, that talked about applying Griswold to unmarried couples. And we looked at the testimony, and with Senator Deconcini asking Justice Thomas, ‘‘When you say you have no quarrel with something,’’ and he used that exact formulation this morning with you, Senator Feinstein, also with respect to Plyler v. Doe, Justice Thomas was asked, ‘‘do you mean something different when you say you have no quarrel with than saying that you agree with,’’ and Judge Thomas said, ‘‘Yes, I mean something different when I say I have no quarrel with.’’ Therefore, when I was listening so closely to those answers— Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Greenberger— Ms. GREENBERGER.—I did not come away— Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Greenberger—

Ms. GREENBERGER. I will just finish. I did not come away with reassurance.
Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Greenberger, I am reluctant to interrupt you, but—
Ms. GREENBERGER. That is all right. Chairman SPECTER.—we are way over time, way, way over time. Do you have anything further, Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. No. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Coach Jackson, we are glad to have you here and thank you for your loyalty to your students and players and the courage to stand up. You know, I admire people who in businesses or a big organization like school systems and State government have the gumption to stand in there for what they believe in. I am sure it was a long battle and you are gratified by that result. I am informed that while you are here, this may be the first time in 18 years you have missed one of your kids’ games, is that correct? Mr. JACKSON. Actually, that was last year when I came up for the Supreme Court argument. Senator SESSIONS. For that case? Mr. JACKSON. Right. Yes, sir. Senator SESSIONS. That is a remarkable record of fidelity to your students and thank you for your service to young people in Alabama. Mr. JACKSON. Thank you. Senator SESSIONS. You know, I see Mr. Botelho and Ms. Wright, Democrats, I believe, that have expressed such strong support for Judge Roberts. I read in the record earlier today our former Democratic Attorney General Bill Baxley, an excellent, superb lawyer in the State who worked on three cases with Judge Roberts and I introduced his record, it was so effusive in his praise for Judge Roberts. And, Ms. Stetson, on C–SPAN, I just happened to catch, late one night within the last week, an interview by a member of Hogan and Hartson, I believe, Ms. Brannan. Is that a member of the firm? Ms. STETSON. Yes, she is. Senator SESSIONS. And she said she had been on the campaign trail with John Kerry and was a Democrat, and it was just an incredibly beautiful statement by her, maybe 15 or more—maybe 30 minutes discussing her experience with Judge Roberts, how fair and objective he was, how much the firm admired him, how collegial he was, how he was highly intelligent but was not a bookworm, that he met the people in the firm, was always open to questions. Is that his reputation within the firm? Ms. STETSON. That is absolutely his reputation within the firm. Everyone that I have spoken to about the judge, everyone who knows the judge, who worked with the judge, I think would come forward and say the same thing. Senator SESSIONS. Well, I think it is important for us to note that Democrats also who know him and who are being objective and who may have voted for someone else other than President Bush for President are very supportive of Judge Roberts.

I know, Ms. Greenberger, that you sort of represent a coalition of groups that are the point people for the activist judiciary. I think that is fair to say. And I remember—and had it just pulled up and I found it—a 2001 New York Times article that discussed a retreat that the Democratic Senators had in 2001 for the purpose of forging a unified party strategy to combat the White House judicial nominees. And you and Professor Tribe and Professor Cass Sunstein appeared, according to the article, and it states that you said to them it was important for the Senate to change the ground rules of confirmations and not to confirm one simply because they were scholarly or erudite. So I guess my question to you is: Are you the architect of the filibuster strategy? Do you claim credit for that?
[Laughter.] Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, as I am sure, Senator Sessions, you know, you can’t trust always what reporters say in terms of the accuracy. I never talked about changing the ground rules for confirmations at all. So I am not certain about that article, but that certainly wasn’t anything I would have said. But what I did then and do believe now is that looking at somebody’s record is absolutely essential. And I agree, I think, Senator Sessions, with you, too, that there are a lot of issues to be taken into consideration, personal qualities absolutely, but also the Supreme Court—and I know you have said this many times—makes an enormous difference in people’s lives, and who will fill that precious seat of Chief Justice couldn’t be more important. Because you brought that article up, to me record is so essential, and there was one other point I wanted to make with respect to the record. I heard this morning a reference to a study of Judge Roberts’s record on the D.C. Circuit. And, of course, he has not been a judge for very long, so by definition, it is a very limited record. And it was pointed out in the study, which I am the first to say I have not had a chance to see, that in some worker and labor issues, he actually sided more with the Democratic side of appointed judges. But the same article in the Washington Post that described that also said for civil rights and civil liberties cases, albeit for a very limited record, of course, according to this article he was four times more likely to vote against the plaintiffs in those cases for civil rights and civil liberties than the average appellate judge on the bench today. And that was very sobering, I must say, with respect to the record. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator— Senator SESSIONS. I think on those cases I believe the panels were about 97 percent unanimous on those rulings, and I would offer this article from the New York Times for the record. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be admitted. Senator Leahy has one follow-up question for Mr. Jackson. Senator LEAHY. It is not really a follow-up. With running back and forth, I missed part of the schedule. Coach, I admire you. I have sat in so many hearings with whistleblowers in government, Federal Government, State government. I know it is very, very tough to be a whistleblower. It is tough to stand up for equal treatment. We heard a bit earlier from John Lewis and Nathan Jones and other leaders in the civil rights move-

I think your children and your team should be very, very proud of you. I know I am. I hope your school appreciates you. I hope they value your participation. And I hope a lot of people in the country were listening to you because, by golly, if something is not being done right, stand up, speak up, and thank God there are people like you.
Mr. JACKSON. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Coach Jackson, you are going to be regarded differently when you go back to your school. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. But I am not sure which way. Mr. JACKSON. Okay, okay. Chairman SPECTER. To be commended by the Senate Committee, which I think this is one issue we can be unanimous on. Thank you all very, very much. Chairman SPECTER. We will move now to panel number five: Professor Fried, Professor Edelman—if panel number five would come forward, we would appreciate it. Senator LEAHY. While they are coming forward, Mr. Chairman, could I ask consent that a number of letters regarding the nomination be included in the record? Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Our first witness on this panel is Professor Charles Fried, Beneficial Professor of Law at Harvard, served as Solicitor General for 4 years; for 4 years was on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts as an Associate Justice; undergraduate degree from Princeton, law degree from Columbia, bachelor’s and master’s from Oxford, an extraordinary academic and professional record. If the witnesses could move in and out, I would appreciate it. Professor Fried, we are going to start your time now because we are running very close.
STATEMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, AND BENEFICIAL PROFESSOR OF LAW, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS
Mr. FRIED. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It is a great privilege to be allowed to participate in this historic hearing for such an important event, and it is particularly a privilege because I have been watching these hearings, and I must say, they have been a model of intelligence, fairness, substantiveness, and civility. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you. Mr. FRIED. I warmly support Judge Roberts because I am persuaded he knows the difference between law and politics. I think that not because I know him well—I hardly know him at all—but because I have studied his judicial writings. Politics at its best, as this distinguished group of Senators knows, is the art of recognizing and doing the best you can for the people you are responsible for. The judge does his or her best, too,

but the judge is hemmed in by the law—not in any simple-minded way, not in any mechanical way, by the intent of the Framers only, by the text of the statute only. And Judge Roberts does not believe that. He has told you so, and in his opinions he has written so, but by precedent, by the words of the statutes, but also by legislative history, by tradition, and the craft of the law. Judge Roberts seems to understand this down to his shoes, understands it with grace and humanity.
My former boss, Dick Thornburgh, stole a number of my lines because I, too, wanted to read to you that first paragraph from the Hedgepath opinion, because it shows a man who not only has a head but a heart. But the other thing it showed was that though he has a heart as well as a head, he understood that if he were to say that what happened there violated the Constitution, he would be unfaithful to Supreme Court precedent, which he was bound to adhere to, and, in fact, he would have been really worse than unfaithful to it.
The other thing which he might have thought is, well, this is a terrible result. He said that it was a terrible result. And I can get away with it because the case is probably too trivial for the Supreme Court to take on review. But that is not the man who you are passing on today.
In that opinion, you see his authentic voice and character. As I read and hear some of the criticisms of Judge Roberts’s judging, I wonder whether we are talking about the same man. I wonder whether the critics are not really complaining that Judge Roberts didn’t start with the result, their result, and then wrestle the law around until it fitted. That is not the man you are passing on.
And when I think of some of the cases which he decided which have become controversial in these hearings, not just the French fry case but, of course, the hapless toad case as well, which Professor Bellia will be talking about, when you consider his decision about arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act where there is a congressional Act mandating that there be a preference for arbitration, when I consider the opinion which he did not write but which he joined in the Hamdan case, what I see is a fidelity to law, not the pursuit of an agenda.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Fried appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Fried. We turn now to Professor Peter Edelman from the Georgetown Law School, where he has been since 1982. He took leave from 1993 to work in President Clinton’s administration as counselor to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and as Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. He had worked as legislative counsel for Senator Robert Kennedy. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg and Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals. Quite a background, Professor Edelman. Thank you for coming in today, and the floor is yours.

STATEMENT OF PETER B. EDELMAN, PROFESSOR OF LAW, CODIRECTOR, JOINT DEGREE IN LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. EDELMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased to be here and appreciate the opportunity to testify and join Professor Fried in complimenting the Committee as a citizen on the civility of these proceedings and the way in which there is an opportunity to educate our country. I think after that we probably disagree.
I am here to urge that this nomination of Judge Roberts be rejected. The history of the decisions interpreting our Constitution is one that over the two-plus centuries is one of greatly increasing protection for the rights and liberties of our people. The evolution in the meaning of the open-ended language has meant more respect for individual rights and liberties against governmental over-reaching and at the same time more power for Congress to act to protect people against exploitation and injury by special interests. And as many witnesses have said, this has all made a great difference in the lives of millions of Americans, the two witnesses on the previous panel. So who sits on the Court matters really crucially for all of us.
Senator Biden talked about the record as one criterion before the earlier panel. Senator Kyl talked about best evidence. And I think that the best evidence we have here is really a long record over a long period of time, unlike some nominees that come before this Committee, not just his judicial record. And to me—and I did start out looking into this and doing the reading without a particular view other than knowing Judge Roberts’s reputation as a very intelligent and able lawyer and as a conservative. But what I have concluded is really that it adds up to a troubling likelihood that we have here a nominee who as Chief Justice is really going to try to turn the clock back on this pattern of protection that I talked about.
It is not about one particular case that might be overruled. As to any one case, as important as it is, it is difficult to figure out what he might do. It is really about his judicial philosophy across the board in a whole lot of areas. It is how he views the Constitution as a whole. And it is where that will take him in particular cases and many different kinds of questions.
He says a lot of the memos from the early 1980’s were as a young staff lawyer done at the behest of his superiors. I think he is too modest, because you look at that and over and over again those memoranda that often he wrote on his own initiative or in response to a question, recommendations for action were requested, there was no decision already made. And he was at the right fringe of even his conservative colleagues in the Reagan administration. And so that is the issue here, and this is kind of a pure case about the direction that a nominee is going to take.
There is no question about his intelligence, his ability as a lawyer, his integrity, his character. Those are not in issue. The issue is one of a conservatism that I think really radically threatens the meaning of the Constitution as we know it.
He said the other day that judging is like being an umpire, just calling the balls and strikes, and I am not one for adding to the
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:17 Oct 26, 2005 Jkt 023539 PO 00000 Frm 00524 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\23539.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

513
pile of sports analogies here. But, you know, if the umpire stands two steps to the right behind the catcher, strikes are going to look like balls and many balls are going to look like strikes. And so I think the analogy is remarkably disingenuous.
Constitutional interpretation is not like calling balls and strikes. Why do we have 5–4 decisions? These are matters of first impression where the precedent is to be looked at, but they are there because the decision has not been made on the issue. And so what we are here is trying to see—trying to compare these strong differences of view that exist, 5–4, about the meaning of the text, because that is the heart of it, the intention of the Framers, and all the other relevant history and societal values. And so it is subtle and complex, and there is a deep division and debate, and that is why this nomination is so important.
We are really looking at a question of what our Constitution is all about, and we are looking at whether it is about fundamental principles of protection of individual rights and liberties or really a much more cramped and crabbed view of those things.
You know, we have changed over the course of a century. The cramped view was where we were 100 years ago, and I am afraid from looking at the record here that as a Chief Justice Judge Roberts is going to work to take us back in time.
Many of you remember the hearings—we all remember the hearings on Judge Bork’s nomination. He made things easy for the Committee. He put it all in one article in the Indiana Law Journal. There it was and the Committee could decide, the Senate could decide.
Judge Roberts is what I call Bork by accretion, bit by bit, memo by memo, speech by speech, and now opinion by opinion. And I think what it adds up to is far more erratically conservative than Judge Bork.
And so if you go through the list of issues—Senator Kennedy, you asked him about a series of civil rights issues. Others have asked about other matters. When you add them all up, I think you have a pattern in each of these areas—civil rights, civil liberties, access to justice, a whole series of things—and then the pattern adds up to a pattern. And so that is why I am here really to testify, because I think that what the pattern adds up to is a dangerous recipe for our Nation, one that may result in injury and renewed vulnerability for literally millions of Americans who fought for decades and even centuries to be included in our constitutional promises.
So I do urge the Committee and the Senate to reject this nomination. Thank you for the chance to testify.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Edelman appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Breaking protocol just a little, Professor Edelman, do you really think Judge Bork made it easy for the Committee?
[Laughter.] Mr. EDELMAN. I think— Chairman SPECTER. You don’t have to answer that question. Mr. EDELMAN. I appreciate the comment, Senator, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman SPECTER. Our next witness is Professor Patricia Bellia from Notre Dame, an extraordinary academic record, summa cum laude from Harvard, Yale Law School graduate, clerked for Justice O’Connor, and before that, Judge Cabranes of the Second Circuit. Thank you for coming in today, Professor Bellia, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF PATRICIA L. BELLIA, PROFESSOR OF LAW, NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL, SOUTH BEND, INDIANA
Ms. BELLIA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and other distinguished members of this Committee. It is an honor for me to appear before you in support of the President’s nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. I have never worked with Judge Roberts. Indeed, I have never met him. But during my time in Washington as a law clerk and as a lawyer in the Justice Department, I have had the privilege to know his work as an advocate before the Supreme Court.
More recently, in my teaching and research in constitutional law and other areas, I have come to know his work as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In my view, the best evidence of how a nominee will perform as a judge is how he has performed as a judge. I have read all of the opinions that Judge Roberts has written in his time on the D.C. Circuit. His service on that court demonstrates beyond doubt that he resolves cases with competence, care and fair-mindedness. Most importantly, his jurisprudence on the court of appeals demonstrates in decided fashion that Judge Roberts does not seek in his decisions to advance any platform of any current political ideology. He has joined and written opinions upholding claims of criminal defendants and joined and written opinions denying such claims. He has both accepted and rejected challenges to executive agency action claimed to be unlawful. He has interpreted statutes with great care, with a primary focus on the text that Congress has enacted, but never categorically dismissing any evidence that is probative of congressional intent.
His opinions, be they for the court or for himself, display no rancor; rather, they are notable for the respect and care with which they outline any disagreement he might have with the position of litigants or his colleagues on the court. Nor do his opinions betray any impatience for the claims of any class of litigants. The occasional hints of exasperation in Judge Roberts’s opinions are reserved for the district court judge or the administrative agency that has decided upon the rights and claims of individuals without providing the considered explanation to which he believes all persons who find themselves before our tribunals are entitled. It is, therefore, no surprise to find in Judge Roberts’s opinions an extensive and careful scrutiny of the individual claims that each case squarely presents, no more and no less.
There is not the time here for me to analyze each opinion that Judge Roberts has written on the court of appeals, and my written testimony examines in detail two areas of structural constitutional law in which Judge Roberts’s work has been subject to criticism, the first involving questions of congressional power and the second involving questions of Executive power, particularly in foreign af-

515
fairs. Here I will simply allude to the first of those controversies and explain briefly why I believe that the criticism are unfounded.
A claim has been made that Judge Roberts takes an unduly narrow view of Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause, one that endangers a variety of civil rights statutes and environmental regulations that Congress has justly designed to protect equal rights of all Americans in the environment in which we live. This concern stems from Judge Roberts’s opinion in a case called Rancho Viejo v. Norton, the hapless toad case. In that case, a housing developer, after losing a Commerce Clause challenge to a particular application of the Federal Endangered Species Act, sought rehearing of its claim before the full court of appeals. The active members of the D.C. Circuit declined to rehear the case, and Judge Roberts dissented from that denial of rehearing.
It is important to establish precisely what Judge Roberts’s dissent says and what it does not say. The dissent does not show that Judge Roberts believed the Endangered Species Act to be unconstitutional as applied in this case or as applied in any other case. Rather, he believed that the particular methodology that the court employed in deciding the case was out of step with Supreme Court doctrine. He took care to point out that en banc review would afford the court the opportunity to consider alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Rather than demonstrating a hostility to congressional power, the dissent demonstrates a concern that courts provide the right reasons for their decisions. That concern is, of course, well founded as the reasons that courts provide in support of their decisions are central to the corpus of law that will guide judicial action in subsequent cases.
A discussion of a single opinion in isolation certainly cannot capture the depth and care and respect for every litigant that Judge Roberts’s opinions display, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss other aspects of Judge Roberts’s opinions in response to your questions. But I believe that his jurisprudence on the court of appeals reflects the best of what we can and should expect of a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. His decisions defy categorization as conservative or liberal, Republican or Democrat. Indeed, Judge Roberts himself has refused to characterize himself as subscribing to any particular judicial philosophy. He says that he simply decides every case as it comes before him according to the law as best he can discern it. What he has accomplished thus far on the court of appeals demonstrates that he has truthfully represented himself to the American public. Simply put, he has demonstrated that he possesses one of our Nation’s foremost legal minds, that he employs that mind with full fairness and integrity, and in all of this that he well deserves our trust to lead our Nation’s judiciary.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Bellia appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Bellia. Thank you for being so close to the time. Three seconds yielded back.

She teaches on the feminist theory gender procedure, co-chair of the Women’s Faculty Forum, a member of the Ninth Circuit Gender Bias Task Force—that is quite a title—and co-author of the monograph ‘‘Effects of Gender.’’

STATEMENT OF JUDITH RESNIK, ARTHUR LIMAN PROFESSOR OF LAW, YALE LAW SCHOOL, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT
Ms. RESNIK. Thank you. I am honored to participate, and I have submitted a written statement for the record. In these 5 minutes—
Chairman SPECTER. It will be made a part of the record in full. Ms. RESNIK. Thank you. I am going to make five fast points. First, while I am here because I was invited by this Committee, we are all here in this room with a TV because the Constitution has invited us all. The Constitution has committed to the political branches of the United States the decision about who shall be our life-tenured judges. The President nominates, the Senate confirms. We are part of a national teach-in about America, its values, and what the courts stand for. In recent years, the confirmation process has been criticized. Some have been difficult. But conflict is not an artifact of these cameras or of the conflicts over Bork and Thomas. It goes back hundreds of years. Remember that in the 1790’s, the Senate did not affirm the Chief Justice because they disagreed with John Rutledge’s view of a treaty with England. In the 19th century, it was a debate about railroads and unions. We have seen time and again that we debate our values through this process. So in other words, this hearing is not only about John Roberts, it is about us, Americans, what we care about for our system of justice. Point one. Point two. This is no ordinary hearing, even though it is about a life-tenured appointment to the United States Supreme Court. This is about who is going to be the Chief Justice of the United States, the 17th person in our entire history to hold that position. The job of the Chief has not remained static. It has grown enormously over the 20th century. As a law professor of the Federal courts and of adjudication and civil procedure, we get to credit William Howard Taft and, most recently, the extraordinary work of William Rehnquist. The person who wears the robe of the Chief Justice, striped or basic black, doesn’t only wear one hat, but many hats. Senator Kennedy, Senator Thurmond talked about this person as the major symbol of justice in the United States. More than that, this person has enormous power over the administration of justice in the United States. In addition to being the head of the United States Supreme Court, this person is the CEO, the chief executive officer of the entire Federal judicial system—1,200 life-tenured judges, a budget of more than $4 billion, a staff of more than 30,000 working in 750 courthouses around the United States, hearing hundreds of thousands of cases every year for all of us. The

517
Chief is the head of the policymaking body for the Federal judiciary. The Chief picks about 50 judges who sit on specialized courts dealing from foreign surveillance to product liability. The Chief picks 250 people to serve on the committees that make the rules that we all litigate by in the Federal system. The Chief sets the agenda for the Federal courts through its annual state of the judiciary address.
Now, this repertoire of powers is startling and actually anomalous for a democracy. Unlike what judges do in court, working openly, giving decisions, accountable, transparent, the administrative powers are not easily seen, probably not even known to lots of people. Further, unlike most administrators, the Chief has that power, at least under current practices, for life. The President has term limits. You all have to run. Even administrators move on. Not so under current practice.
Now, this package of power is not constitutionally mandated. The Constitution only mentions the Chief once, and it is in terms of the impeachment of the President. So given that this is the rare occasion of how much we think about the Chief Justice, I would be remiss not to mention that there is a chance that we could rethink the issue of the Chief Justice rotating 4-, 5-year, 6-year terms.
Quick recap: Point one, an opportunity to reflect on American values, take our constitutional temperature. Point two, an extraordinary appointment, the unique roles of the Chief.
Point three, therefore this is the occasion to figure out what the qualifications and requirements for the Chief are, which gets me to my answer, Point four, the Chief Justice of the United States should be the chief advocate for justice in the United States, should be the person insistent on access to the courts. Clear, the courts are vital. The Chief Justice should be committed to an independent and vibrant branch of Government called the third branch. The Chief Justice should come here telling you, the Congress, that it needs more resources, needs more access, should be the guardian at the gate of justice. We need the Chief to be sure that the President, the Executive, respects the independence of adjudication and that the Congress does as well. Most important, we need a Chief Justice who understands that law has to be a source of strength for those who don’t have it, who need it; not only a source a strength for those who already have the resources, who can already get easily into court. Those are the litmus tests of which we can be proud.
My fifth and final point: What does the nominee’s record tell us thus far? I have reviewed only written materials from 1981 to 1986, when he was a policymaking lawyer and signing them in his own name; only decisions on the D.C. Circuit; only published essays and transcripts—nothing from the SG’s Office, nothing from private practice, because we can’t know what his own personal views are.
I regret to report that, at least as of this set of materials, Judge Roberts has not expressed an affirmative vision of deep enthusiasm for the role of courts for adjudication for the needs that courts fill for ordinary Americans. When given the opportunity to argue for courts for their accessibility, when given the opportunity to argue the Department of Justice should lend its hand to the needy Ameri-

cans in need of more resources, when given the opportunity to interpret statutes to let us into court, in general the nominee has argued against the use of courts.
There has been some shorthand in these hearings for some of those decisions. I feel obliged to mention at least one other. There is a case called Booker, which is about a problem all of us face, where the courthouse door is closing on us because we have cell phones and credit cards that mandate we go to arbitration. There is an Equal Action to Justice case, there are several others. There are many instances in the record in which, at least thus far, the nominee has not—
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Resnik, would you summarize your testimony, please?
Ms. RESNIK. I am just closing right now. What we are looking for in the Chief Justice is a person who will celebrate courts and the role they play in a vital, economically stable democracy. And that is the question before the Senate: Is this person’s record the one to commend this person for that job?
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Resnik appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Resnik. Our next witness is Professor Christopher Yoo, professor at Vanderbilt University Law School, a distinguished academic record, a graduate of Harvard, an MBA at the Anderson School at UCLA and Northwestern Law School, clerked for Justice Kennedy, and practiced with Hogan & Hartson. Thank you very much for coming in, Professor Yoo, and the floor is yours for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER S. YOO, PROFESSOR OF LAW, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE
Mr. YOO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. It is an honor to be here to testify in support of John Roberts’s nomination as Chief Justice of the United States.
I have had the chance to observe Judge Roberts from three different vantage points—first as an associate working the appellate group of Hogan & Hartson, second as a law clerk watching Judge Roberts argue before the Supreme Court of the United States, and third as a member of the faculty of the Vanderbilt University Law School reading his judicial opinions.
Because there are many other colleagues here in a position to testify to his excellence as an appellate advocate and to his performance on the Court of Appeals, I will focus my remarks on the time Judge Roberts and I spent at Hogan & Hartson. I am sure Senator Biden will be gratified to hear that, during his time at Hogan & Hartson, John Roberts demonstrated to me an openmindedness, an ability to bring people together, that would serve him well as Chief Justice. He also treated everyone around him with respect and decency. I had the chance to witness these qualities first-hand in the support and compassion that he showed to me when a tragedy struck my family.

Judge Roberts’s open-mindedness is evident in his decision to join Hogan & Hartson when leaving the White House Counsel’s Office in 1986. Hogan has long prided itself on its ability to embrace attorneys from across the political spectrum. To cite just two prominent examples, its ranks include former House Minority Leader Bob Michel and such leading Democrats as former Chairman of the House Subcommittee of Health and the Environment, Paul Rogers. It is also a firm that takes seriously the bar’s obligation to provide free legal services to public interest organizations and to individuals who are unable to afford them. Judge Roberts was exceptionally well-liked throughout the firm. His regular lunch partners reflected the underlying diversity of the firm itself.
Even more telling is his decision to return to Hogan after his successful stint as Principal Deputy Solicitor General. At a time when firms were lining up for the chance to hire him, including firms that attract those who wish to surround themselves with like-minded colleagues, Judge Roberts preferred to return to a more balanced and politically diverse environment.
Judge Roberts’s open-mindedness can also be seen in the manner in which he developed Hogan’s appellate practice. Although the practice group was never large, the attorneys he hired reflected the diversity of the entire firm. Indeed, I suspect that he takes considerable pride in the fact that nearly half of the associates brought into the appellate group under his leadership were women, and that the women with whom he worked most closely on Supreme Court and appellate matters are now partners in the appellate group.
He also represented a broad range of clients with diverse and even conflicting ideologies without requiring that every client’s position match his own personal views. His reputation for fairness and willingness to engage all viewpoints were so well-established that Democratic attorneys general and Governors did not hesitate to hire him to represent their interests. In the process, he successfully advocated positions on behalf of clients, on environmental protection, and race-conscious remedies that did not match what many might regard as the standard conservative position on those issues.
The pattern of fairness and open-mindedness that is apparent in his professional decisions is consistent with my own experiences working with Judge Roberts. He brought the same probing intellect and a rigorous professionalism to every aspect of each case, searching through every possible viewpoint in the process of deciding how best to approach it. Simply put, Judge Roberts’s tenure at Hogan & Hartson suggests a person who is fair and who is willing to engage and consider all points of view before making up his mind.
My other memory of Judge Roberts from our time together at Hogan is the respect with which he treated everyone around him, from senior partners to secretaries and paralegals to law students who were only working at the firm for a summer. He was always supportive and encouraging even while holding us to the highest professional standards.
He also never forgot the personal side of the people who worked for him. I had the chance to see this aspect of Judge Roberts’s character first-hand shortly after I rejoined the firm after my Supreme Court clerkship. I was working full-bore on a slate of cases. My fa-

ther-in-law had just arrived in the D.C. area to celebrate the recent birth of my second son, Brendan. Shortly after my father-in-law arrived, he was admitted to the intensive care unit of Arlington Hospital. After a three-and-a-half-month battle for his life, he eventually died.
Judge Roberts reacted the way we wish everyone would. The minute he found out about my father-in-law’s illness, he offered his sympathy and support. He rearranged my assignments to make it possible for me to make my family my first priority. He often checked in on me, always with a thoughtful gesture and a kind word. And when my father-in-law passed away, he released me from all of my assignments on a moment’s notice, placed me on paid leave of absence so I could take care of my family when it needed me, even though I was facing a number of deadlines and doing so would mean taking on considerable work himself.
When I returned, he welcomed me back with open arms, without a single word about the problems caused by the abruptness of my departure. For John Roberts, it was all very simple. It was just the right thing to do.
At the same time, Judge Roberts has a humility that is somewhat surprising in someone so accomplished.
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Yoo, would you please summarize at this point?
Mr. YOO. In short, I am convinced that John Roberts possesses the open-mindedness, compassion, and humility that the Senate seeks in the members of our Nation’s highest court. He combines these qualities with a respect for the law and for the Supreme Court as an institution that leave no doubt in my mind that he would make an admirable Chief Justice.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Yoo appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Professor Yoo. That was a good transition, to ask you to summarize and to go right to ‘‘in short.’’ Our next witness and final one on this panel is Professor David Strauss. And extraordinary academic background. A member of the Magna Cum Laude Harvard Law School Club—not too many of you. Judge Roberts is one. Two years at Oxford. An attorney advisor in the Carter Justice Department. Worked on the Judiciary Committee here as special counsel during the Justice Souter nomination proceedings. And has been at the University of Chicago for some time, 18 cases before the Supreme Court. You’re on, Professor Strauss.
STATEMENT OF DAVID STRAUSS, HARRY N. WYATT PROFESSOR OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW SCHOOL, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
Mr. STRAUSS. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. It is an honor to appear before you.
My purpose here is, really, not to pass judgment on John Roberts, someone I admire very much in many ways, but rather to speak about a development in the subject I teach and study, constitutional law, something that has happened in that area in the last generation that is very significant and directly relevant to this

hearing and to the judicial appointments process generally, and that development is a change in the nature of judicial conservatism. You can see the change if you look at what President Nixon said when he appointed Justice Rehnquist, and what President Bush, who of course has nominated Justice Rehnquist’s successor has said.
President Nixon said he wanted to appoint a judicial conservative, and he identified his model. His model was Justice Harlan. President Bush, of course, has identified his models, and his models are Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. All these people are judicial conservatives, but there is a world of difference between the two different kinds of conservatism. The hallmarks of Justice Harlan’s work were deference to Congress and respect for precedent. The hallmarks of the new conservatism is something close to the opposite of that, a skeptical attitude toward the work of Congress, and a willingness to overturn precedent. And it is really that difference, not the difference between liberals and conservatives, but the difference between these two different kinds of conservatism that make the stakes in the judicial appointments process very high at this point in our history.
I identified a number of areas in my written remarks where I think the stakes are high. Let me just mention two here. The first is Congress’s power to address the problems facing the American people and to protect the rights of the American people. I think it is fair to say that the power of Congress to do those things is under challenge in the judiciary today in a way it has not been since before the Great Depression, and this is true not just in the case of the now-famous toad, but in area after area, and many of which the hearings have discussed, in the area of environmental protection, workplace safety, consumer protection, campaign finance, the rights of the disabled as we heard, the free exercise of religion, age discrimination, gender discrimination, the protection of intellectual property rights, and all of those areas there are significant efforts under way in the judiciary to limit in important ways the power of Congress to do what it has been doing now for the better part of a century, protecting the rights and serving the needs of the American people.
The other area is of course the right of privacy. The modern right of privacy was essentially an invention of Justice Harlan, a judicial conservative that President Nixon cited as a model when he appointed Justice Rehnquist. It was an opinion Justice Harlan wrote that was the font of privacy law that has extended not just in the case of abortion, but in many other areas, not just in the case of reproductive rights, but in many other areas today.
Justice Harlan took a view of privacy that rested on a general and expansive reading of American traditions. He did not expect people claiming rights to point to some specific tradition or some specific body of law. He understood that the questions were more difficult than that. The right of privacy now, if anything, is more important, indeed much more important than it was when Justice Harlan wrote, ‘‘With changes in reproductive technology and endof-life technologies that make these questions all the more acute.’’
The question whether we will have a Justice Harlan-like approach to the right of privacy or a skeptical approach to the right

of privacy that questions whether it even exists and evinces a desire to confine it as narrowly as possible, that question it seems to me is very much on the table, and will be a question that will be with us for the next generation.
I don’t want to be alarmist about this. The law doesn’t change overnight. These are not changes that will occur maybe not even with this appointment, but there are points in the history of the Supreme Court—the New Deal was one, the civil rights revolution was one—there are points in the history of the Supreme Court where the Court rethinks and redefines its relationship to the other branches of Government and its relationship to the rights of individuals. We may be at such a point. There are indications that we are at such a point. We have not passed it yet, but the next few appointments to the Supreme Court will determine whether this is an era in which the Supreme Court redefines its relationship in a way that is basically unknown to Americans living today. Those are the stakes presented by this appointment and by other appointments that this Committee will face.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Strauss appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Strauss, for those profound comments. This is an extraordinary panel which could yield a lot of fruits with a lot of questioning, except that we have six more witnesses and it is almost 6 o’clock. I am going to start by yielding to Senator Feinstein. Senator FEINSTEIN. I have no questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. I am glad I yielded to you, Senator Feinstein. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Sessions. Senator SESSIONS. Mr. Fried, it is an honor to have you with us. I was a member of the Department of Justice when you served as Solicitor General and you represent the best in American law, and I am pleased to see you are at Harvard and teaching students what American law is all about. I notice that the legal publications have declared that Judge Roberts is the premier appellate court practitioner in America, in a generation. You argued before the Supreme Court. I do not think you are personal friends with Judge Roberts, but from your observations, how do you rank him as a scholar and as a practitioner in the Supreme Court? Mr. FRIED. As a practitioner, he is the best. As a scholar, he does not exist. He does not purport to be a scholar. He has not written scholarly articles. That is not his business. And in that respect he is very much like some of the greats. Earl Warren was not a scholar when he went on the Court and had no written articles. Henry Friendly wrote all his articles after he became a judge. Similarly, I think with Benjamin Nathan Cardozo. So it does not denigrate Judge Roberts to say scholarly is not what he has done. Perhaps he shall, but he has not so far.

Senator SESSIONS. With regard to his service on the court and his express philosophy of being a neutral umpire, one who decides a case before the court and not one to impose any personal or political views through his opinions. Is that consistent, in your opinion, with the classical American tradition of law?
Mr. FRIED. It is the best tradition, Senator, the very best tradition.
Senator SESSIONS. Would you agree with one witness at our hearing who said if you believe and cherish your liberties, your liberties are much safer with a judge who shows restraint than one who is an activist?
Mr. FRIED. Well, I have never understood what that restraint-activist contrast is meant to show. But I think my liberties are safest with a judge who will listen to the facts of my case, will listen to my lawyer’s arguments, and will decide on the basis of them, rather than a judge who comes in with an agenda or with a predisposition or perhaps even with a philosophy.
Senator SESSIONS. And if they are faithful to the Constitution, in the long run our liberties are protected in that fashion also, are they not?
Mr. FRIED. The rule of law is our greatest protection, Senator. Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your service to your country and sharing these thoughts with us today. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Now that we have saved so much time, I am going to take a few minutes on a question or two. Professor Resnik, you advance a fascinating suggestion that the Chief Justice position might be rotated. Suggest that by an Act of Congress? Ms. RESNIK. There are many different possibilities. Chairman SPECTER. You would not expect them to make a deal among themselves. [Laughter.] Ms. RESNIK. Well, actually because the role of the Chief Justice is a mixture of about dozens of statutes that this Congress episodically enacted and many customs, it would be possible for the Court to develop a custom that would alter the allocation of authority. Chairman SPECTER. How about an Act of Congress? That is something we can do something about. We do not seem to have too much influence on the Court even with our confirmation process. Ms. RESNIK. Congress has— Chairman SPECTER. Because once confirmed, we never hear from them. They never call, they never write. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Can Congress pass an Act to rotate the Chief Justice job? Ms. RESNIK. In my view and reading of the Constitution, yes, Congress has the authority to decide if the chief justice ship is a position that could be inhabited by one member of the Court for a certain period of time, and then by another. In addition— Chairman SPECTER. Would that be reviewable by the Court?

524
Ms. RESNIK. Well, we believe that every statute can be considered for its constitutionality. So of course the Court could consider it. And then question would be—
Chairman SPECTER. They would not have a conflict of interest? Ms. RESNIK. Well, the Court has actually developed a rule called the Rule of Necessity, which is to say that it says when everyone is disqualified, then no one is disqualified. There was actually a Supreme Court in Texas, old decision in the 1920s that says when everyone is disqualified, we have to go find an extra ad hoc court for a moment. So there are differences depending on the State or Federal system, but right now the Court would—in fact, as you know, the Court has considered challenges that say that you have unfairly diminished their salary under Article III, and the Court has said, ‘‘We have to sit on those cases because here we are,’’ and have decided sometimes yes and sometimes no under the Article III guarantee of no diminution of salary. Chairman SPECTER. Have we been successful in diminishing their salary? Ms. RESNIK. According to the Court, you have. There have been a couple instances— Chairman SPECTER. So we have a formula where we can do that constitutionally? Ms. RESNIK. You have—in your hat as Members of Congress you can pass statutes that the Court then reviews. You may not diminish their salary, but the close questions come up on things like if you are prospectively altering COLAs, cost-of-living increases, or you are changing the benefits or annuities. Those are the kinds of instances that come up. There have been a few class actions by some judges who are doing that, and as you know, the Chief Justice of the United States was here, Chief Justice Rehnquist was a wonderful advocate, greatly concerned about the— Chairman SPECTER. Professor Resnik, I want to stay within 5 minutes so I want to move on, if I may. Ms. RESNIK. Certainly. Chairman SPECTER. Professor Strauss, you gave a fascinating analysis, but you did not tell us whether you are for or against Judge Roberts. Do you care to do that? Mr. STRAUSS. Actually, Senator, with all respect, I do not. Chairman SPECTER. There has been another witness here who did not answer questions. You have some precedent. [Laughter.] Mr. STRAUSS. Well, I cannot say this will come before me in another capacity so I do not want to prejudge it. I do not want to—my expertise is in constitutional law. I feel comfortable talking about that. I do not want to claim the sort of familiarity with Judge Roberts’s record. I have not had the conversations with him that Members of the Committee have had, and I do not think it would serve a purpose to take sides. Chairman SPECTER. I respect that. Professor Fried, I have read, and wanted it confirmed, and I sent my Chief Counsel to confirm it, that you had written on the subject of Roe v. Wade, that you thought it was wrongly decided, but that it would not be reversed. Did you take a position on whether it should be reversed as well as the two propositions I articulated, be-

cause they would not be inconsistent to think it was wrongly decided and think that having lasted so long that it ought to stay.
Mr. FRIED. I think it will not be reversed, and I do not think it should be reversed. Not only has it become—
Chairman SPECTER. Even though you were against the decision? Mr. FRIED. It was wrongly decided initially, as not only I, but Archibald Cox, Paul Freund, and others thought, but it has become, as you say, a super precedent, and not only has it become— Chairman SPECTER. Only super with 38 chances to reverse it? Mr. FRIED. Super duper, if you wish. Chairman SPECTER. Oh, I do. Thank you very much. That is the first authentication I have had. Mr. FRIED. It is not only that it has been reaffirmed as to abortion, but that it has ramified, it has struck roots, so it has been cited and used in the Lawrence case, the homosexual sodomy case, in some of the opinions in the right-to-die cases, in the Troxall case, which is the grandparent visiting right case. So it is not only that it is there and it is a big tree, but it has ramified and exfoliated, and it would be an enormous disruption. Chairman SPECTER. That is what? [Laughter.] Mr. FRIED. So you not only get branches, you get leaves. Chairman SPECTER. Exfoliated. Mr. FRIED. It has got all of that, and that means— Chairman SPECTER. I know what exfoliated means. I just did not hear you. [Laughter.] Mr. FRIED. Since I do not know Judge Roberts except most casually and I certainly have never discussed it, if you want a prediction from me, I would predict that he would never vote—not never—but he would not vote to overrule it for the reasons that I have given. Chairman SPECTER. Well, that is a topic of extensive discussion in the cloakrooms of the Senate and on the Senate floor and in the hallways. Senator Feinstein and I were talking about it, whether he would or would not, and there are clues, but no certainty. I am past time. I would really like to engage in some more discussion but I have duties to proceed. Senator DeWine has joined us. I am confident this will be a no question response, but I will ask the question. Senator? Senator DEWINE. Very short. Professor Resnik, I know you had some comments about the Chief Justice and you had an exchange with the Chairman in regard to the rotation of the Chief Justice. Just kind of a general question. Are you troubled in any way by the growing authority of the Chief Justice, or do you want to comment about that at all? Ms. RESNIK. Yes. I write about the Federal courts— Senator DEWINE. I understand that. Ms. RESNIK.—and I have raised concerns about this because I think that this is too large a charter, some of it coming back to the Senate. The Congress has given in several statutes direct authority to the Chief Justice to appoint other—from life-tenured judges, judges to sit on courts. That does not have to be the way that judges are assigned. They could, for example, be assigned to spe-

526
cialized courts by taking all of the judges on the courts of appeals through some random rotation. And there is a lot of—
Senator DEWINE. The FISA Court, for example, is appointed by the Chief—
Ms. RESNIK. There is a colleague, another law professor named Theodore Ruger at the University of Pennsylvania who has analyzed the appointments on that court and has a law review article detailing it. He actually reports that the Chief Justice has—who is the one who has the count of about 50 appointments of other judges to specialized panels or courts.
The Congress also could, for example, the Judicial Conference of the United States, which is the major policymaking body, that could be chaired by, again, a rotating group of court of appeals judges. The many committees that are being appointed—many other judiciaries around the world are dealing with this question. How do we provide all the justice we need to for all of our citizens, have it organized, be sure that there is a voice that comes to tell the world about its need, and then not develop a kind of bureaucracy that means that judges are losing their role as adjudicators as they seek to set agendas and set future agendas.
It is a hard problem that everyone is facing because we need lots of judges. If you go back at the turn of the century, the 1900’s, fewer than 100 judges around the United States, life-tenured. Fast forward, between magistrate and bankruptcy judges, we have got 2,000. They need organization, they need equipment, they need staffs. They need all these things. But at the same time, we also need to cherish the role of open, visible, accessible courts, and that is the challenge and I think that the Congress and the courts could work together, as they have over the last century to create this great system, in rethinking the allocation of authority.
Senator DEWINE. That is very helpful. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator DeWine. Thank you very much.

Ms. FURCHTGOTT-ROTH. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am honored to be invited to testify before your Committee today on the subject of Judge John Roberts and his record on women’s economic issues.
I have followed and written about these issues for many years, and with your permission, I would like to submit my written testimony for the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record in full.
Ms. FURCHTGOTT-ROTH. Some observers are concerned about Judge Roberts’s attitudes towards women. I believe his record is supportive of women and that the policies he advocated are in women’s best interests.
Women made extraordinary progress during Ronald Reagan’s Presidency. President Reagan’s goals of spurring growth by lowering taxes were extremely popular. After Congress enacted his tax cuts during his first term, he was reelected in 1984 with over 60 percent of the vote. Congress then enacted further tax cuts proposed by President Reagan, and by the end of his Presidency, the tax rate for the median family had fallen from 24 to 15 percent. As taxes were reduced, the economy expanded and women were some of the main beneficiaries of that economic growth.
In the 1980’s, women moved rapidly into the workforce. At the same time, their unemployment rates fell. Women’s earnings compared to men’s grew faster in the 1980’s under President Reagan than in any other decade in U.S. history.
Women also progressed in education in the 1980’s. By 1990, women were earning over half of all B.A. and M.A. degrees. That is still true today. More women got M.B.A. and law degrees and more became doctors and lawyers.
Now the United States leads the industrialized world in job creation and unemployment rates of 4.9 percent are among the lowest. Unemployment rates for women in many other countries are double our rate.
Even though women were so successful in the 1980’s, some are concerned about Judge Roberts’s views on comparable worth. Some believe that if comparable worth had been implemented, women would have made even more progress. But that concern is misguided. Comparable worth doesn’t mean equal pay for equal work, which is already the law and which is the principle that President Reagan and Judge Roberts supported. Instead, comparable worth means equal pay for entirely different categories of jobs based on categories of workers as determined by government officials.
Comparable worth supporters claim that it is unfair that some mostly male occupations, such as sewer workers, are paid more than some mostly female occupations, such as clerical specialists. But for better or for worse, our economic system rewards American workers on the basis of how much the public values their service and is actually willing to pay for their services, not based on how much an official says that it is worth.
Some jobs have higher earnings than others because people are willing to pay more for them. Many jobs are dirty and dangerous, such as oil drilling, construction work, mining, and roofing. These jobs are primarily performed by men. Women aren’t excluded from

528
these jobs, but they often choose careers with a more pleasant environment and potentially more flexible schedules, such as teaching, communications, and office work. Many of these jobs pay less.
Proponents of comparable worth cite an example in Oregon. There, female clerical specialists were given raises of over $7,000 a year to bring them in line with male senior sewer workers. Everyone, given the choice of working in an office or a sewer at the same salary, would choose the office. You just have to pay people more for work about and in sewers.
Women’s progress in the 1980’s would have been hampered by comparable worth. Comparable worth would have worked against women because artificially high wages would have prevented them from being hired. When wages get too high, employers cut back on numbers of workers. Comparable worth assumes that women cannot ever succeed in certain fields on their own, but need government assistance.
Some observers have criticized Judge Roberts because they disagree with memoranda he wrote on Title IX and college athletics in the early 1980’s. In particular, Judge Roberts wrote in 1982 that Title IX only applied to specific programs receiving Federal aid and not to all programs in a particular educational institution, but that was what Title IX required at the time, as corroborated by the Supreme Court in 1984. The Supreme Court ruled that only the program that actually received Federal funds, rather than the entire college or university, need to comply with Title IX. As I wrote in a book in 2001, the six-to-three opinion effectively prevented the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education from investigating a college athletic department for Title IX violations unless that department was the direct recipient of Federal funds, which most were not.
In writing about Title IX, Judge Roberts argued persuasively that the executive branch and regulatory agencies should comply with Congress’s direction. He correctly wrote in a 1982 memo—
Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Roth, could you summarize your testimony at this point?
Ms. FURCHTGOTT-ROTH. Yes. Yes. I will summarize my testimony by saying that Congress changed the law in 1987 by passing the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 and that Judge Roberts’s comments on Title IX, if the law had been in place in 1982, his comments would have been very, very different.
And in short, I would like to say that wage discrimination laws and Title IX guidelines aren’t a decision for judges, but for Members of Congress. It is Members of Congress who decide on the laws and give the executive branch the authority to design and implement these regulations. Therefore, it would be up to you, Senators, to evaluate the costs and the benefits of the issues. And should he be confirmed as Chief Justice, Judge Roberts’s role will be to interpret the laws and adjudicate disputes containing the laws that you were going to pass. Thank you very much.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Furchtgott-Roth appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Our next witness is Professor Robert Reich, who had been Professor of Social and Economic Policy at Brandeis

There has been much discussion in these hearings about social values, and I want to put on the table something that maybe has not received quite the attention it should, and that is economic values. And I don’t think I have to tell the Committee what almost everybody knows, and that is that wealth and income and the power that come from wealth and income are more concentrated in fewer hands as a proportion of the population today than we have seen since the 1920s, and by some measures since the gilded age of the 1890s.
Now, if this doesn’t present issues of economic morality, I don’t know what does, and it comes to the fore with regard to Congress and the Supreme Court in a whole series of protections, some of them very old, some of them going back to the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s, having to do with workplace protections, unemployment insurance, interpretations of Social Security, interpretations of minimum wage, the ways in which we treat our working people in this country.
Now, I heard Judge Roberts, at least to the best of my memory, in the last couple of days tell this Committee that he would rule on the side of the little guy when the Constitution told him to and he would rule on the side of the big guy when the Constitution was on the side of the big guy. Now, I assume that he is talking about little guy and big guy in figurative terms, in terms of economic power and wealth and status in society. But last time I looked at my Constitution, it doesn’t say anything about average working people or big guys or little guys at all.

In fact, there have been times in our history where the Supreme Court came down consistently on the side of wealth and power and against little guys, against average working people. Up until 1937, for example, the Supreme Court threw out a lot of State and Federal regulation that was intended to help average working people.
Judge Roberts has a record—it is not much of a record. It is something of a gamble for all of us. But let me reveal a little bit of autobiographical detail that perhaps you did not know, and I do this not to burnish my otherwise impeccable Republican credentials but simply to tell you that I know something about a particular institution. I started out my life in Government as Assistant to the Solicitor General where I had a chance to brief and argue Supreme Court cases. And my first boss was Robert Bork.
Now, in those days, the Solicitor General’s office regarded its primary client as the Supreme Court, not the administration. It wasn’t until the mid-1980s that there was a new position created in the Solicitor General’s office called the Special Deputy. That was a political position. It was a political deputy, and it was about values. That political deputy was there for a very simple reason: to make sure that the Solicitor General’s office and the briefs and arguments before the Supreme Court were in consistency, were consistent with the values of the President in terms of social values, economic values, whatever have you.
I have read Judge Roberts’s memoranda, and there is no question in my mind, having had that experience in the Solicitor General’s office, that he came down consistently, uniformly on the side of very conservative economic and social values. I am not criticizing him for it, but I think it is very important that you know that.
Here in this hearing he said, for example, he refused to affirm Wickard v. Filburn. Now, you know as well as I do, over the last 10 years more than 30 times the Supreme Court has struck down, either in whole or in part, laws of this Congress. Ten of those, at least, have been based on the Commerce Clause. Wickard v. Filburn in my knowledge, in my experience, is a cornerstone of building the protections of a strong Federal Government for average working people. His refusal to affirm that I find personally quite troubling.
There has been reference also to the hapless toad. Well, we know that he was looking for other ways, perhaps, to find that Endangered Species Act constitutional. But look at that logic in that particular case. When he says Congress didn’t really have authority under the Commerce Clause to protect the life of a hapless toad that, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California, well, obviously people are not toads—at least the last time I looked—but what about protecting the job safety of a hapless retail worker who, for reasons of her own, lives her entire life in Pennsylvania, or a hapless coal miner who, for reasons of his own, lives his entire life in West Virginia?
Let me just finally say this: One Justice can make all the difference to our entire system of Federal protections. One Justice. The Court did change its mind in 1937, as I said before, and it stopped striking down laws that protected people, average working people, not because, as popularly understood, FDR threatened to

pack the court. No. In fact, the Court made that switch before it even knew that FDR had a court-packing scheme. The Justice—
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Reich, could you summarize your testimony at this point?
Mr. REICH. I will do it in one sentence. The Justice who made that switch was Justice Roberts, Justice Owen Roberts. And it would be a cruel joke of history if a namesake almost 60 years later turned the Court backward.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Reich appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Reich. Our next witness is Rabbi Dale Polakoff, President of the Rabbinical Council of America, whose membership consists of more than 1,000 ordained rabbis. He serves as Rabbi of Great Neck Synagogue, Long Island, a faculty member of the North Shore Hebrew Academy, a graduate of Yeshiva where he majored in psychology. Thank you very much for joining us today, Rabbi, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF RABBI DALE POLAKOFF, PRESIDENT, RABBINICAL COUNCIL OF AMERICA, GREAT NECK, NEW YORK
Rabbi POLAKOFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and other distinguished members of the Committee. Good afternoon, or, perhaps, good evening. Thank you for inviting me to participate in these hearings.
The Rabbinical Council of America includes congregational rabbis, teachers and academicians, military chaplains, some of whom serve today in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas of the world, health care chaplains, organizational professionals, and others. I am here this afternoon to offer a statement of support for the nomination of Judge John G. Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States.
My remarks about Judge Roberts begin this afternoon with broad brush strokes because the desired qualities of judges within the Jewish tradition are defined in just such broad brush strokes. We are enjoined to choose principled judges who refrain from showing favoritism to individuals or causes. We seek judges who are people of truth, whose words and decisions inspire confidence in those who rely upon them. Our tradition recognizes the tremendous responsibility borne by those who judge others and sees in their dispensing of truth and justice a divine partnership ensuring the continuation of a moral society.
At a time in which many in our society seek moral moorings and spiritual strength, I am certain that these broad values are also the values embraced by this great country in which we are privileged to live. Values of principle, values of truth, and values of responsibility are part of the foundation of religious ethics upon which our Nation has been built. And I am confident that Judge Roberts represents the embodiment of such values.
Within these broad brush strokes, though, are many hues of color, and it is the responsibility of this Judiciary Committee to try to determine how Judge Roberts sees those colors.

As a representative of the clergy of a minority faith community, I and my colleagues are also interested in an area of seminal importance to us, namely, the relationship between religion and state in society. In an effort to gain insight into Judge Roberts’s understanding of that relationship, as defined by the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment, we were encouraged by a memorandum written to Counsel Fred Fielding on August 20, 1984, regarding remarks to be made by President Reagan to an ecumenical prayer breakfast. Then-Counsel Roberts suggested that the references to ‘‘church’’ or ‘‘churches’’ be changed to references to ‘‘religion’’ or ‘‘religions.’’ He noted that, and I quote, ‘‘Many of our citizens do not worship in churches but in temples and mosques.’’ We believe that this comment demonstrates a sensitivity and appreciation for the diversity of religious faith in America, and we hope is a harbinger of Judge Roberts’s view in this crucial area.
There are those who suggest that Mr. Roberts’s subsequent participation in presenting the view of the United States in several religion cases should be of concern. In this matter, we rely on the guidance of the Institute of Public Affairs of the Union of Orthodox Congregations of America, a sister nonpartisan religious organization. Their research indicates that in each of the cases, the positions advocated by the United States were neither extreme nor even unreasonable interpretations of the Religion Clause’s requirements.
As members of this Committee are well aware, the contours of religious liberty in this Nation are still being shaped by the Supreme Court. Should the Senate confirm Judge Roberts, he will be on the Court this term, when, in the case of Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita, it will again examine the extent to which minority religions will have their religious liberty protected against Government interference, and Congress’s ability to protect that liberty through laws like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which many of you championed a decade ago.
While we cannot be certain, we are optimistic that a Justice Roberts will be supportive and solicitous of religious liberty in America. His answers this week to questions you and your colleagues have asked him about the Constitution’s Religion Clauses were indeed reassuring.
The Rabbinical Council of America has taken this public position of support for the nomination of Judge Roberts in the spirit of this year’s celebration of 350 years of American Jewish history. The Jewish community, like so many other faith communities, has greatly benefited from the religious liberty guaranteed by our Constitution. We have been able to build houses of worship and study and to create communities reflective of our values and traditions. We believe it, thus, appropriate through our active participation in this process that we acknowledge our debt of gratitude to America, to a Nation that has pledged to uphold the conviction that liberty and equal justice under law are for all.
Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Rabbi Polakoff appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Rabbi.

Our next witness is Dr. Susan Thistlethwaite, President of the Chicago Theological Seminary, a Ph.D. from Duke University, a master’s of divinity summa cum laude, undergraduate degree from Smith, the author of several books and op-ed pieces in various newspapers.
Thank you for joining us, Dr. Thistlethwaite, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF SUSAN THISTLETHWAITE, PRESIDENT, CHICAGO THEOLOGICAL SEMINAR, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. Thank you, Chairman Specter, and members of the Committee. My name is Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite. I am president and professor of theology at Chicago Theological Seminary. My academic training is in historical theology. My teaching and writing have emphasized contemporary religious life, with particular attention to religion and social justice. It is an honor to be asked to give testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and with your permission, I will submit it for the record.
Our Constitution’s promises, such as the right to live free of tyranny and be able to worship freely, are generous, even extravagant promises. They are promises made after freedom had been won from tyranny—a tyranny both political and ecclesiastical. They are promises made to the best of the human spirit as created by God.
In the limited documents available to discern John Roberts’s views, there is evidence—and I have cited detail in my written testimony—that his judicial posture is more toward permissiveness in religious establishment and is less than vigorous in the defense of religious minorities and their freedoms. He refers to the so-called right to privacy, has objected to affirmative action, but has favored expanding both the authority of law enforcement and Presidential authority. Very disturbing to me is the view, and I quote, ‘‘The Geneva Convention is unenforceable in U.S. courts and, in any case, does not apply to detainees labeled ‘enemy combatants.’ ’’ I submit to you the threat to the moral health of the Nation of this view is extremely grave.
A Supreme Court Justice entrusted to interpret the Constitution must embrace the fundamental element of our democracy. We will strive to be a body politic rooted in justice and fairness for all citizens. A Justice entrusted to interpret the Constitution must understand that the protection of the free exercise of religion and the prohibition of any establishment of religion are particularly critical to the way in which in this Constitution promises to establish justice.
Few Americans have understood the promises inherent in our Constitution better than Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King in his ‘‘I Have A Dream’’ speech was able, as few before or since, to reach into our constitutional past and proclaim the deep sense of the words that the Constitution was a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. King argued that so far this promissory note to African-Americans had been returned: insufficient funds. But the promise held. The promise for King was a dream, but not a fantasy.
Dr. King’s vision, as is well known, was a deeply theological vision. It is perhaps less well known that the Framers of the Con-

534
stitution also drew on a theological vision and that their prohibition of the establishment of any religion and their insistence on the protection of the free exercise of religion was made for religious reasons. The thought of John Locke on whose work the Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson drew is instructive. Locke, like others in the 17th century, had seen the terrible results of religious wars, as Catholics and Protestants struggled for power in England. His own faith finally led him to believe that it is only in the absolute protection of human civil society from any control by religious authorities that people are enabled to come to have faith in God. It was for a theological reason, not a secular one, that both Locke and Thomas Jefferson separated church and state and prohibited establishing one religion over any other. In that way, they protected religious freedom.
In Jefferson’s ‘‘A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom,’’ he argues, ‘‘The plan of our holy author of our religion is not to propagate it by coercion.’’ They made this simple point: God does not need the help of the state for there to be faith.
From our vantage point in the 21st century, we can see the Framers were right. They did not just protect political freedom. They protected religious freedom. It is no accident that the United States through all of its history so far has been free from the terrible effects of religious war. The Framers of the Constitution knew what they were about.
As retiring Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote in an opinion last term, ‘‘Those who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must, therefore, answer a difficult question: Why would we trade a system that has served us so well for one that has served us so poorly? ’’
What has become evidence in the last half of the 20th century and into the 21st is that our society is becoming more genuinely religiously diverse. The Harvard Pluralism Project has documented that the United States is rapidly becoming the most religiously diverse nation in the world. Such increasing religion pluralism calls for even greater vigilance both in protecting religious minorities and clearly avoiding even the appearance of the establishment of any particular religion. The Constitution is a document that seeks to implement a vision of fundamental human rights, a vision of a society such as none in history has seen before, a vision that would establish justice, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty.
I have been impressed with the incisive mind of John Roberts. That is a necessary but not a sufficient credential for Chief Justice. I am not as convinced that he believes in the dream that is the United States of America.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Thistlethwaite appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Thistlethwaite.

graduate of Michigan State, and a law degree from the Cooley School of Law.
Thank you for coming in today, Governor Engler, and the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF JOHN ENGLER, FORMER GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN, AND PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. ENGLER. Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, and distinguished members of this Committee, I am pleased to be here today to testify in support of the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be the next Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
This is an important moment for the National Association of Manufacturers because it is the first time that we have participated in a proceeding of this type. I would like to take a minute just to explain why we have taken this historic step.
When I joined the NAM on October 1st of last year, I did bring that experience you referenced, 20 years in the Michigan legislature, 12 years as Governor of Michigan, from 1991 to 2003. During that time as Governor, I felt that Michigan businesses were facing crushing legal costs and barriers. I also learned and saw first-hand laws that I had helped write in the State Senate or signed as a Governor were in many instances ignored, rewritten, or set aside by judges unclear about or dismissive of their sworn duties.
In part because of this, the legal environment for doing business in Michigan had become unpredictable, unfavorable, and unacceptable. As Governor, I set out to change this by recruiting to the judiciary individuals who were committed to uphold the law and not legislate from the bench. During 12 years as a Governor I appointed more than 200 judges to the Michigan courts, and that included three State Supreme Court justices, each of whom has a record of faithfully interpreting and applying the law.
Now, as a result of these appointments, coupled with equally needed and important tort reform legislation, cases filed with the Michigan circuit courts dropped by some 17 percent between 1997 and 2004. The legal costs of doing business in Michigan declined. People of Michigan, through this debate and period of time, came to understand that the certainty and predictability the judges help foster when they follow the law not only can lead to a better business climate but, necessarily then, are key to jobs and prosperity.
The same can be true at the national level. Nationally, our legal system today consumes some 2.3 percent of GDP. Its cost is actually about 7 1⁄2 times as high as that of any of our key trading partners. The high cost of lawsuit abuse continues to be an impediment to our ability to compete in the global economy.
Now of course much of the solution to this doesn’t like with the Federal courts but in State legislatures and the Congress, which must write clear laws that recognize these realities. That is why the NAM continues to advocate asbestos reform that has been the subject of much hard work by this very Committee, and further tort reform in areas like products liability.
Now, that said, to achieve a business environment that is fair and predictable and where the rules are clearly spelled out and adhered to, it is essential to have judges who will apply the rules the

536
legislature or the Congress establishes in a fair and predictable manner. The United States Supreme Court must set the example. The need for this fundamental fairness and predictability is why the NAM decided that the time had come to take positions on judicial nominations.
After reviewing Judge John Roberts’s record, we are convinced he is eminently qualified to lead the Court. Judge Roberts has the intellect and the experience needed to understand and address complicated transactions and difficult legal problems. At the same time, he is committed to applying the law rather than applying his own personal views. This philosophy is essential if we are to remain a Nation guided by the rule of law.
Finally, John Roberts understands the importance of clarity when deciding cases and the practical consequence of decisions for business. I might add that, really, none of the current members of the Court come from a recent private-sector kind of background. Judge Roberts does. He brings that. Accordingly, if confirmed, Justice Roberts will add an important voice to the Court’s deliberations because of his strong experience of how litigation affects major commercial transactions. This background will assist the Court in identifying cases that present business issues of national importance for its review and also in understanding the practical ramifications of rules set out through its decisions.
As I close, let me make it clear that the NAM also didn’t seek to determine if Judge Roberts will reach or is likely to reach a particular outcome favorable to business. The principal difficulty with an outcome-based approach is that the outcomes a Justice should reach ought depend on what the duly enacted law is. In many areas, different companies and businesses will disagree on what the pro-business result actually is.
Therefore, the National Association of Manufacturers is not looking for Justices biased in favor of or against business or whose decisions reflect or are likely to reflect a pro-business outlook, but rather, for a Justice who will properly and impartially apply the law. We are convinced Judge Roberts is such a Justice, and I respectfully urge this Committee to set in a timely manner his nomination before the full Senate.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Engler appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Governor Engler. Our final witness is Ms. Karen Pearl, interim president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

enthood Federation of America. I am honored to be here today to express the concerns and hopes of our patients and America’s prochoice majority.
I come before you not as an individual, but as a representative of millions. Through Planned Parenthood’s 850 health centers, we provide health services to nearly 5 million women, men, and young people every year. One in four American women will visit a Planned Parenthood center in her lifetime. These women represent Americans from every walk of life and from every part of the country.
What is at stake in these hearings is nothing less than women’s lives and women’s health. Americans deserve a Supreme Court that will protect, not take away, our basic freedoms.
The record of John Roberts reveals a nominee who, as Chief Justice, is not likely to uphold constitutional protections for the right to choose abortion. And while we have fought hard for that right and will fight just as hard to protect it, Planned Parenthood does everything in our power to reduce the need for abortion. Yet there are forces at work in this Nation who seek to restrict comprehensive sex education, contraception, and emergency contraception— the very things that would decrease the number of abortions in this country.
In his response to questions from some of the members of this Committee, Judge Roberts has refused to state that he accepts and will protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose, a right that has been part of the fabric of our society for nearly two generations. We ask that you oppose his nomination to the lifetime position of Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
Five years ago, in Stenberg v. Carhart, four of the nine Justices made it clear that they support either overturning Roe v. Wade or significantly gutting it. To do so would seriously threaten constitutional protections against government regulations that threaten women’s health and safety. To do so would send us back to a preRoe era where women did not have an equal place at life’s table and when making child-bearing decisions was a perilous enterprise.
The American people deserve a Chief Justice who will uphold Roe, and yet Judge Roberts co-authored a brief, filed on behalf of the Government in Rust v. Sullivan, that stated Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled. It is hard for me to understand, Senators, how a decision that for the past three decades has helped women participate equally in society could have been wrongly decided. It is hard for me to understand why a decision that allowed women to realize their dreams should be overruled.
We at Planned Parenthood are faced with the prospect of violence and intimidation every day of our lives. On my first day on the job at Planned Parenthood, a sign was posted on the front door that threatened, ‘‘Anyone who enters will be killed.’’ And as I volunteered as a clinic escort, violent protesters hit us with their signs. In the Bray case, Judge Roberts is one of the authors of a brief arguing in support of the legal position of violent clinical protesters. Nowhere in the brief did the Government disavow the actions or the tactics of the violent demonstrators, not even in a footnote.

538
When women’s health centers in Wichita, Kansas were being blockaded in 1991, a district court issued an injunction against the protesters to protect women who were attempting to enter the centers. Judge Roberts was involved in a highly unusual intervention that sought to lift the injunction, even though the injunction was preventing violence and safeguarding women.
This week, Judge Roberts repeatedly refused to answer whether he will protect the basic rights and freedoms of all Americans. Senator Specter himself pointed out that Roe has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court multiple times. Notably, Judge Roberts has acknowledged that there is a right to contraception. He is comfortable making these statements, but he steadfastly refuses to acknowledge the same about the right to abortion.
As a legal matter, we believe that the right to choose abortion is as settled a fundamental right as the right to contraception. No one should be confirmed to a lifetime position with the power to take away the right to choose, who does not accept that proposition. When Judge Roberts answers questions about Griswold and Eisenstadt but refuses, when it comes to Roe and Casey, Judge Roberts is drawing lines of convenience, not rules of law.
No matter how remarkable the person or impressive the resume, a nominee for Chief Justice ought to be able to tell the American people whether the Constitution allows States to ban abortion. Judge Roberts has refused to do so, even when pressed by you.
We still do not know whether a Roberts’s Court would preside over the creation of two Americas, one where women with means can obtain abortions even if they are not legal, and one where women without resources cannot.
When our patients’ safety is at stake, when the ability of families—
Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Pearl, would you summarize at this point, please?
Ms. PEARL. I will. Private decisions about their lives is at stake, when women’s status in our society is at stake, accepting anything less than clarity would simply be irresponsible.
You all know that Justice Harry Blackman wrote the majority opinion in the Roe v. Wade decision. In the decades following that decision, as more Justices on the Court ruled to overturn Roe, Blackman wrote, ‘‘A chill wind blows.’’ His words echo hauntingly today.
Senators, I urge you to not confirm Judge John Roberts as Chief Justice, and I thank you so much for the honor and privilege of addressing you today.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Pearl appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Pearl. Just a few questions. The hour is growing late. Ms. Pearl, the hearing has dealt extensively with the concerns that you have addressed, a woman’s right to choose, and it boiled down really to Judge Roberts’s statement that he felt he could not speak to that issue as a matter of judicial independence in a context where there are cases on the docket which raise the issue, unlike Griswold which has been pretty well established as a right to privacy, something I asked him about, and others did.

539
Do you think that—I know you would like to have an answer. People who want to overrule Roe would also like to have an answer. But do you think there is any basis for Judge Roberts’s statement that he simply cannot prejudge the matter before it comes before him as a matter of independence, judicial independence, and that he cannot sell his vote one way or another?
There are people on this panel on both sides of the issue. I think we are divided among the 18, 9 to 9. Does he not have a point that he cannot prejudge the case?
Ms. PEARL. Senator, thank you. I do not think that that is correct. We are not asking him to prejudge any case. We have not presented him with any facts of any particular case.
Chairman SPECTER. But you are asking him to say he would sustain Roe v. Wade, a woman’s right to choose.
Ms. PEARL. We are asking him whether the precedent that has been established, and as you said, reaffirmed 38 times, is settled law of this land, established rights. Women have counted on that right for almost two generations, for 32 years. It is hard to believe that that is not something that ought to be considered settled law. It was the Roe decision that was only 1 year after the Eisenstadt decision, so the timeframe should not matter, and it has been looked at so many more times. This is, you know, the decision— the question of whether and when to become a parent is such a fundamental right that it is hard to believe that it is even open for any kind of question. And if Judge Roberts was willing to talk about the right to privacy as it relates to contraception, he ought to have been able to talk about it as it relates to abortion.
Reproductive rights are simply not to be negotiated. Chairman SPECTER. Professor Reich, going back to your JD from Yale, what is your evaluation of the issue of judicial independence and not soliciting votes on this Committee or in the Senate by a promise one way or the other on Roe v. Wade when the issue is on the docket for the Supreme Court in the next term? Mr. REICH. I think it is entirely dependent, Mr. Chairman, on how settled the case is. That is, if you have something that is a super, super, super-duper precedent, as you repeatedly talk about it, then it would seem to me entirely appropriate for a candidate, a nominee to say, ‘‘I would follow a super-duper precedent just like Wickard v. Filburn.’’ On the other hand, if it is up in the air, if it really is up in the air, if there are a lot of 5–4 decisions, it is likely to come before him, he does not want to reveal his cards right now because it would be inappropriate, then it is a different story. In this case it seems to me that Roe v. Wade is the law of the land. It has been there for many years. Why cannot a nominee simply say clearly, ‘‘I support Roe v. Wade as the law of the land? ’’ Chairman SPECTER. Unlike the right to privacy or contraceptives for marriage or for single people, there is a great debate—I do not have to describe it for you—a great debate in this country about the subject. If the definition, if it is up in the air or settled, I do not think, as you heard me say, that we could ask him about his decision. But on the factors which Ms. Pearl articulates, he testified he would give them great weight.

It is really unpredictable as to what any nominee is going to do. Who would have predicted that Justice Kennedy would have supported Roe v. Wade? The cases are legion in the history of the Court. The only consistency is one of surprise.
Rabbi Polakoff, has your organization taken a position on any Supreme Court nominees in the past?
Rabbi POLAKOFF. No, Mr. Chairman, we have not, but we feel that in a generation, and certainly in today’s society, with traditional values and religious ethics threatened, that it is important for there to be a spiritual voice added to the hearings by this distinguished group, and that is why we are here today.
Chairman SPECTER. Governor, my time is almost to expire, but I have time for a question. Does this mean the National Association for Manufacturers is going to become more politically active like supporting asbestos reform?
[Laughter.] Mr. ENGLAR. You can count on that, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. Thank you super-duper much. [Laughter.] Mr. ENGLAR. I thank you, and I am hoping that the expeditious conclusion of this matter will allow a little bit of floor time for that important topic. Chairman SPECTER. This Committee has done its job. Now it is up to the floor time of the leader. Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. I am so tempted, but I will withhold. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Hatch. Senator HATCH. Let me ask, Ms. Pearl, let me ask you the same question I asked Marcia Greenberger, for whom I have great respect as well. Since Justice Rehnquist or even before, has Planned Parenthood ever approved or endorsed or accepted or been favorably disposed towards any Republican nominee to the United States Supreme Court? Ms. PEARL. Thank you, Senator. I would like to start by saying that Planned Parenthood does not make these kinds of decisions on any kind of partisan basis. It is not that we approve or disapprove of Republican nominees, approve or disapprove of Democratic nominees. To your specific point, however, I am mostly certain—and I am very happy to go back and check and send you a letter to confirm— that Planned Parenthood did not take a position on Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator HATCH. But that is the only one you can recall? Ms. PEARL. That is the one that I recall right now, yes. Senator HATCH. I know your group is a close ally of the National Organization for Women. They have testified I think in almost every one except this one. Both of your groups, for example, I think are members of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights? Ms. PEARL. We are not. Senator HATCH. You are not. Ms. PEARL. We actually have an application pending. Senator HATCH. NOW opposed Justice John Paul Stevens’s nomination in 1975, saying his record showed he would, quote, ‘‘bend

over backwards’’ to limit the right to abortion. We all know that did not happen. NOW opposed Justice Anthony Kennedy’s nomination in 1987 saying his record shows a ‘‘total lack of commitment to equality and justice under law.’’
I had a flyer that I saw circulated in 1990 by the National Organization for Women opposing the nomination of David Souter. It says, ‘‘Stop Souter or women will die.’’
The reason I raise this, and because as we all know, these Justices have supported abortion rights. I personally do not know where Justice Roberts is on that issue, and I do not think you do, nor do I think anybody else does, because he has never really opined on it. Now you cite cases where he was working for the Reagan administration, which clearly was against Roe v. Wade. But he was a staff attorney making the legal arguments that they wanted him to make, which is quite a bit different from saddling him with that particular philosophy.
Now, it turns out that the absolute and categorical certainty of those positions against Justices Stevens, Kennedy and Souter were just plain wrong. And that is where I am having some difficulty here. Did your group participate in the Stop Souter Rally that advertised on that flyer that went out? Did you participate in that?
Ms. PEARL. I honestly, I do not know the answer to that. Senator HATCH. I do not either, but I seem to recall that Planned Parenthood did, and they had a right to if they wanted to. It is just that the position was wrong. So what I am saying is it is one thing to think a person may be going to vote a certain way on the Court, but you do not know how Justice Roberts will vote. I do not know how he will vote. You may be right. You may be wrong, as—I think Planned Parenthood was part of it, NOW, the Alliance for Justice, NARAL, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, they were all wrong on those three Justices. If we make these decisions solely because somebody thinks somebody might not live up to what they think the law should be, there would be very few people ever privileged to serve on the United States Supreme Court if both sides started to play that game. All I can say is this, is that your organization is a great organization. I do not agree with some of the policies, but I have also supported you with regard to some aspects of the work that you are trying to do, but not on the abortion side of it. It seems to me that there is a responsibility to not prejudge people who have the eminent qualifications that Judge Roberts has, and that worries me just a wee bit. But I have been interested in your testimony and certainly have listened to it, as I have to all of yours. I welcome my old friend, Robert Reich here. He is always a controversial person who makes us all think more all the time, and you have done it here again today, deliberately I know. And I do respect you and appreciate you, and I like alternative points of view. I think that is a good thing for our society, and you certainly present plenty of them for us to think about up here, both Democrats and Republicans. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy.

Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome the panel and I particularly welcome Bob Reich, who has been a long-time friend. I have been a great admirer of all of his strong commitments to public policy and public life generally. It has been an extraordinary career for he and his wife as well, who shared a strong commitment to public service. Dr. Reich, let me ask you. Judge Roberts, in one of his statements, said the courts are passive institutions. Is that—how do you react to that as a concept? Is that your view about what the courts are, what the courts can be, what the courts should be in trying in particular to help the country respond to this extraordinary challenge, which all Americans are reminded of this past couple of weeks with Katrina, when we sort of tore back the fabric of America, the Gulf States, and saw so many people that have been left out and left behind. We are not talking about handouts. What we are talking about is a hand up. Should not the courts be a part of a process where the Executive and the Congress and the courts are moving in harmony to try and make this a fairer country and more equitable land? And if that is so, what is your reaction to the comment that the courts are passive institutions? Mr. REICH. Senator, the courts are not passive. Anybody who watches carefully, reads Supreme Court opinions, looks at the history of the Supreme Court, understands that they are far from passive institutions. Interpretations of the 14th Amendment, Equal Protection Clause have historically changed the face of this Nation in terms of bringing minorities and women into the mainstream. When I was Secretary of Labor, one of my duties was to implement the Family Medical Leave Act. Well, that was a hard-fought piece of legislation. You know, you were actively involved. The first piece of legislation passed by the Clinton administration that we got through, at least signed into law by Bill Clinton. Well, we did some regulations pursuant to that, some common-sense regulations struck down by this Supreme Court in a very close 5–4 decision, it seems to me. I believe I am right. Said that that particular regulation simply required that an employer notify an employee of his or her family medical leave rights was inconsistent with the purpose of the Act. Well, a judgment that a particular regulation is inconsistent with the purpose of an Act is not a neutral, passive decision. The Court is an active instrument of public policy. It has values, social policy, economic policy. And look, Senator, all of you, I understand. This is a tough one. This is a roll of the dice. I mean you do not have—there is not a lot—there are not a lot of decisions, not a lot of Court decisions. There are some memoranda you had difficulty getting from the administration, a lot of pieces of information. But—and it is presumptuous of me to tell you what to do, but the stakes are so huge here for the country. I do not see how you can, in good faith, given that the Court is not a passive institution, turn the country over to a Court—and it will be turning the country over to a Court where you just do not know what is going to happen.

Senator KENNEDY. I was somewhat disappointed that in the various areas of public policy where Judge Roberts had been so active, I mean he had obviously solicited the job to serve in the administration. He was selected by the administration to serve in the Justice Department, and he felt very comfortable ideologically being there, all of which I respect, and his commitment to public service. But he wanted to be in there and he felt very comfortable, and he was promoted all the way through there.
So he had these series of memoranda stating administration position, and there was always the question whether this was just stating the position or what percent of this was his own views.
The point that I thought was somewhat disappointing, when he was asked, given that was 20 years ago, what was your position today on these issues? And it seemed to me to be pretty ordinary that people would say, ‘‘Look, those were my views then, those of the administration. Today I look at X, Y and Z, whether it is on the issues of civil rights, whether it is on women’s rights, whether it was on the issues on Grove City’’—which was always amazing to me, after we had fought through all of the Civil Rights Act, that an individual could feel—and with all the money that was going to universities with tuition, which was keeping them running—that you would have an individual that would say, ‘‘Well, we wanted just program specific, so if they do not discriminate in the admissions or the financial office and the admissions office, they can discriminate wherever they want at the university.’’
I mean after we had gone through so much in terms of the battle to end discrimination, and the American people were at a position where they felt that we should not permit taxpayers to be funding for discriminatory purposes.
I think my time is over. I think the Chairman might give you 15 seconds or something to respond.
Mr. REICH. Senator, what has come out so far is this man is obviously a nice fellow, people like him. He is a very, very bright, if not brilliant jurist, and an extremely thoughtful lawyer. But he has certain ideological predispositions. He has values. Those values are way to the right of the mainstream in America. I do not think there is any question about it. And so it is up to all of you to decide whether you want to put somebody in as Chief Justice who is that far to the right. I think it is as simple and direct as that.
Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Sessions. Senator SESSIONS. I see Senator Hatch left, but here is the ‘‘Stop Souter or women will die’’ ad I just found, so I guess that did not prove to be a good prediction, except a lot of women partially born have died since Justice Souter went on the Court. Chairman SPECTER. Make that part of the record, Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Yes, I would offer that for the record. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection. Senator SESSIONS. I think, Mr. Reich, that Judge Roberts has a value that he has expressed articulately, beautifully, repeatedly, that he loves the law, he loves the Court, and he believes a Court

has a role to be a neutral arbiter, and not to impose its personal views. And I do not think he brings that because he may be politically conservative and believes in lower taxes or whatever he believes in politically. I think that is his deepest and highest value that was repeatedly stated here many, many times, and I think that is exactly what we need in the courts of America today, and I think the people of this country will be more respectful of the Court if the Court returns to that role. That is my personal view.
Ms. Thistlethwaite, I tried to think over the years about appropriate approaches to the church/state issue. I am Methodist myself and been involved in some of these things. I see you are a liberation theologist, but let me say this: you have expressed some pretty strong views about the need for a wall between church and state, and just yesterday, the Supreme Court—a district court, following what it thought was the command of the Ninth Circuit, ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance, which has ‘‘under God’’ in it, is unconstitutional. Do you have an opinion about that? I think it is in some ways consistent with some rulings in the Supreme Court, as I shared with Judge Roberts, and I think it is perhaps inconsistent with others. How do you feel about the wisdom of having those words in the Pledge of Allegiance?
Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. Well, I am very interested, Senator Sessions, to know whether you think people will be increased in their faith if they just say those words repetitively. I don’t know what the goal is if it is not to establish a deistic religion, because if it is to include the words so that they can be historical, as I am citing from the Founders, God doesn’t need your help.
So if it is historical, that was added to the Pledge of Allegiance. It was not even original in the Pledge. I look at the people out on the street demonstrating. They seem to feel, the people in favor, after the, you know, press show us the pictures of people demonstrating after this decision was made, and the people seem to feel it is prayer. And if it is prayer, then I think it is unconstitutional.
Senator SESSIONS. Well, what about—I guess you would further say that we should take ‘‘In God We Trust’’ off the coins?
Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. Do I think it is a good idea to confuse Caesar and God? No, I don’t. Render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s. I don’t think that is a good idea.
Senator SESSIONS. You would oppose then the Chaplain of the United States Senate?
Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. Pardon me? Senator SESSIONS. Do you oppose the position of Chaplain in the United States Senate? Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. Do I think you all need spiritual guidance? [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. That is part of it, perhaps. Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. I think it is okay if you rotate it around. But I am not the constitutional lawyer. I am a pastor. I am kind of in favor of pastoral care. Senator SESSIONS. Well, I would say this: I think that it is an absolute truth that our Government was founded on a principle that we are created beings with certain inalienable rights. And when you get in a secular-like, Marxist ideologies, they have no re-

spect for life, not the same degree of it, and I think it is a unique portion of our great American spirit that every human being is respected specially because we believe they were created, and such words as ‘‘under God’’ or ‘‘In God We Trust’’ I think are not sectarian. I do not believe they establish a religion, but simply reflect a consensus view of probably 90 percent of Americans that there is a higher being, and I think that the Supreme Court authorities on these matters are somewhat strained and confusing, and perhaps Judge Roberts can improve that. I certainly hope so.
I see my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Senator Coburn, you have the last word. Senator COBURN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since I do, I would just like to compliment you and Senator Leahy. Chairman SPECTER. I am sorry. We can’t hear you. [Laughter.] Senator COBURN. I will say it again and again and again. If my budget is increased, I would be happy to say it. But, you know, as a freshman Senator, the way this hearing has been conducted, the leadership that you, Mr. Chairman, and you, Mr. Leahy, have conducted it under, I think is reflective of good qualities of the United States and the country. And it kind of leads me to the questions that I have, especially for Dr. Thistlethwaite, the last statement that you said, you are not convinced that John Roberts believes in the dream of America. And I am just wondering: Could anybody of conservative values believe in that dream? Is it possible? Because if—and I don’t know John Roberts actual—I go to bed at night worrying if he is on the Supreme Court, I have completely opposite views than Planned Parenthood, certainly about reproduction and other issues. But the question is can somebody have values different, conservative values and believe in the dream of America and be a good judge? Is that possible? Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. I was very impressed by the gentleman who spoke last on the last panel who was testifying to the fact that the definition of the word ‘‘conservative’’ has changed. And I think— Senator COBURN. Well, I don’t want to get into a discussion about the definition of ‘‘conservative.’’ I am a known quantity, all right? I am a known quantity. People know my opinions. I am not very quiet about them, sometimes to my own ill benefit. But the fact is it talks about what Senator Kennedy talked about, and Senator Feinstein: Do they have a heart? And the question is: Can somebody have a set of values that are different than what you perceive to be okay for the American dream and still have the heart of a Senator Kennedy and make a good judge? And I am very confused about what I consider a very inflammatory statement about Judge Roberts in your closing, because what it does is it castigates people into categories, the very thing Jesus said we don’t do. And to me it is concerning that we have this decision that we have already decided how he is going to decide. Well, I want to tell you, I spent 2 hours with him, and I am as pro-life as they come, and I cannot tell you where he is going to be. And I tried to find

out. And if I spent 2 hours with him, how in the world do you all know that he is not going to be? And how do you know based on the history of the judges that have come before this Committee before, who the same claims were made about, and the opposite results came about?
And I think it undermines the testimony, and I think it lends for us to go back and reconsider as a Nation, all of us, the people I represent, the viewpoints I represent, and the viewpoints you represent. Maybe we don’t know people’s heart as well as we think we do when we speak out to make such a charge that John Roberts, you are not convinced he believes in the American dream.
Well, I tell you what. I am convinced he does. And I am also convinced that he has got a great heart. And I have spent hours upon hours here, and I have spent hours with him, and I have spent hours upon hours reading everything that has been brought up about John Roberts. And I think he has got the heart for the American dream. And I would hope—and I will close where I ended. What we need in our country is more pulling together rather than pulling apart. And certainly if that can happen anywhere, it can happen in our country.
I will dedicate myself to try to do that—on everything but spending. I will make that exception. But I will work to pull together, because we are not really all that far apart. We are not that far apart. But we magnify and enlarge the areas where we are apart. And the love from the Almighty, that is what he wants in front of us. And it is my hope as we finish in the things that we do in this Committee in the future—and John Roberts’s career, whatever it is going to be, will be a manifestation that he believes in the dream.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. May I reply? Chairman SPECTER. Dr. Thistlethwaite, do you want to make a comment? Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. Yes. Chairman SPECTER. Go ahead. Ms. THISTLETHWAITE. I wish I had been able to see more than 10 percent, and it was said 10 percent is approximately the documents. I wish that we had been able to see more. I was hoping that the hearings would reveal more. But I can only tell you what is in my heart, and that is that the dream of the Constitution, that it does protect, that it is about the little guy, I am not convinced. And I just—you asked me to tell you what I think, and I tried to do the best I could. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dr. Thistlethwaite, for your comments. They are obviously very, very deeply heartfelt. I think that has been reflected in these hearings very, very extensively. Thank you, panel, for your very profound testimony. We have had 30 witnesses in today who have been very profound, excellent, insightful. I want to thank my colleagues for their attendance. We have worked in 4 days to take on an arduous task, and we have worked late, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday into the evenings, and the attendance here—based on the experience I have had on

this Committee for 25 years, the attendance has been excellent because Senators are very, very busy. Everybody has a half a dozen places where he or she has to be at any time, and the attendance has been really very good.
And I thank specially Senator Leahy for the leadership which he has provided. We have conferred at every step of the way and have had agreement at virtually every step of the way. And where we haven’t had agreement, it has been a very amicable agreement to disagree, and not on the big points. On the big points we have come to terms.
I want to thank Mike O’Neill, chief counsel, and Bruce Cohen, chief counsel for Senator Leahy, and the staffs. Staffs on the Judiciary Committee didn’t have an August. They can pluck August right off the calendar. They examined 71,000 pages of documents, and they are used to all-nighters because they are all students and scholars and have had a lot of all-nighters. So I thank the staff for doing that extraordinary job.
I think it not inappropriate to say that Senator Frist, the Leader, has commented about the many good reports he has had at a time when the Congress has been under a lot of scrutiny for the hurricane and a lot of problems. It can be characterized by others. We were asked to conduct dignified hearings, and except for very minor occasions where the witness might have been permitted a little more opportunity to respond, it has been very, very, very, very smooth sailing. So I am appreciative as the Chairman for what we have done.
Before yielding to Senator Leahy, I would like ask unanimous consent that documents be included in the record, and the record will remain open for 24 hours so that questions can be submitted. And then we will be moving ahead to an executive session by agreement on the 22nd, a week from today. And Senator Leahy and I are in agreement on trying to keep the speeches short—long statements for the record, but to 10 minutes if we can, providing that leadership. All the Senators have their own rights, and we don’t want to impose upon them, but where we have tried to establish time limits, there are 17 Senators on this Committee who like to see the 18th observe the rules. And all of us are willing to take some cutback when we have been able to move with dispatch and get our business done. But Senators, we are a notorious group. People wanted to know when we were going to finish this hearing today, and I said earlier, ‘‘When the last Senator stops speaking.’’ Now I am stopping.
Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. I think that is a hint to me. I want you to know, first off, it has not been totally happy. On this side, we wanted to go through tomorrow and Saturday, Mr. Chairman. We are terribly disappointed you did not make that possible. And, of course, Governor Engler knows what we are saying. To be serious, this is a serious matter. I want to compliment the key witness, Judge Roberts, for sitting here. We did ask him a lot of questions. Some he answered, some he did not. He knows our feelings on both sides of the aisle on that. He spent, I know, almost 3 hours with me and he spent hours upon hours with other members on both sides of the aisle.

Now we will vote. I have no idea how I will vote. I suspect I will probably be announcing it at some time prior to our hearing, but by Thursday I and the others on this Committee will have to vote. I think we have as strong a record as we are going to have, and I compliment the Chairman in that regard. And I compliment both his chief of staff, Mike O’Neill, and mine, Bruce Cohen, for this. But the people—the Chairman is right in mentioning those who have worked throughout August. I came down here during August and checked in on what they were doing. It was extraordinary. I know from the folders scattered throughout my farm in Vermont the other day that they were making sure I knew what they were doing and that I would work with them.
But it is extremely important for the country. I don’t come into this with a preordained idea how I am going to vote. I do want to vote, though, on what is best for my country. I do love my country. I wouldn’t serve here if I did not.
My maternal grandparents came to this country from another country not speaking the language. Both my grandfathers were stonecutters. Both would be proud that I had the opportunity to be here. It is a great opportunity. I don’t take it lightly.
We have said several times that it is only 101 people who get to speak for all 280 million Americans on this: the President when he makes the nomination and the 100 Senators. I think the 100 Senators have to make the best decision possible. We have a great duty here in the advice that we will give the rest of the Senate. I don’t take that lightly.
I do compliment the Chairman. He and I have talked many, many times through this. He has accommodated the wishes of people on my side of the aisle, as he has on his side of the aisle. And we will find out Thursday how we are going to vote. And I appreciate the panels. Many of you have sat through here all day, a long time. I know many of you very well. I know how busy your schedules are. I appreciate you being here.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. I saw Judge Roberts briefly in the hall, and he looked much relieved, and I thanked him for his good humor. It is a great tribute to our Constitution. The President nominates, the executive branch works in, and the legislative branch and our Committee and later the full Senate, and the judiciary. It is a great separation of power and great coordination. It is a great privilege to be a part of the system, and that concludes our hearing. [Whereupon, at 7:10 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Questions and answers and submissions for the record follow.] [Additional material is being retained in the Committee files.]
