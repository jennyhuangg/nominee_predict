A few matters of administration or housekeeping, and then we will proceed to the opening statements. Today we will hear first from Judge Alito—the introduction of his family. Judge, the floor is yours to introduce your family. Judge ALTIO. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me introduce my wife, Martha, who is here today; and my sister, Rosemary, who is a lawyer in New Jersey and a tough trial lawyer. I am glad that she took time from her schedule to come to the hearing today. My daughter, Laura, who is a senior at James Caldwell High School in West Caldwell, New Jersey; and if a father can be permitted to brag for a second, a really great swimmer who led her high school team to win the county championship last week. My son, Phillip, who is a second-year student at the University of Virginia. And when I had my confirmation hearing for the Court of Appeals, Phillip was 3 years old. And when I was called up to the chair, he took it upon himself to run up and sit next to me in case any hard questions came up. [Laughter.] Judge ALTIO. I don’t know whether he is going to try the same thing tomorrow, but probably I could use the help. I am glad that my in-laws are able to be here today: my fatherin-law, Gene Bomgardner, who is a retired Air Force NCO; and my mother-in-law, Barbara Bomgardner, who is a retired Air Force librarian. And my cousins Andrew and Aldomar Kiriev from Gwynedd Valley, Pennsylvania, are also here.

My mother, who turned 91 a couple of weeks ago, unfortunately is not able to be here today, but I am sure she is watching at home.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Well, thank you, Judge Alito. You have a beautiful family, and we are delighted to have them with us on the confirmation proceedings. We will have 10-minute rounds of opening statements, each Senator 10 minutes. We will then turn to the presenters, those who will be presenting Judge Alito formally to the Committee. And then we will administer the oath to Judge Alito, and we will hear his testimony. We will begin tomorrow morning at 9:30 for the opening round of questions. Each Senator will have 30 minutes on the opening round, and we have a second round scheduled of 20 minutes for each Senator. And then we will see how we will proceed. Our practice is to adhere to the time limits, and we do that for a number of reasons. One of them is that Senators come and go, and if we maintain the schedule, which is known to everybody, they know when to return for their next round of questions. We will take 15-minute breaks at a convenient time, and, again, we will hold the breaks to 15 minutes. I have worked closely with Senator Leahy on scheduling matters and all other matters, and this is the model that we used for the confirmation of Chief Justice Roberts. It is our intention to conclude the hearings this week, and as Senator Leahy and I worked out, the arrangement is to have a markup on Tuesday, January the 17th, subject to something extraordinary happening. Now let me yield to the distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don’t want to hold up your opening statement, or the others. I do appreciate people being here. As the hearing for Chief Justice John Roberts showed, there will be real questions asked. I would hope Senators on both sides of the aisle would do that. I think it is important. We are talking about a position representing 295 million Americans. On the schedule, I will work with the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, the Chairman. I understand one of our leaders once said that getting Senators to all move in order is like having bullfrogs in a wheelbarrow. But we will continue to work towards that, and I think the most important thing is we have a good, solid hearing this week. Mr. Chairman, you have been totally fair in your procedures for this, as always.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. And now we begin the opening statements.
No Senator’s vote, except for the declaration of war or the authorization for the use of force, is more important than the confirmation of a nominee to the Supreme Court for a lifetime appointment. Judge Alito comes to this proceeding with extensive experience as a Government lawyer, as a prosecutor, and as a judge. He has written some 361 opinions. He has voted in more than 4,800

cases. And it is possible to select a few of his cases to place him at any and every position on the judicial spectrum. By selecting the right cases, he could look like a flaming liberal or he could look like an arch-conservative.
This hearing will give Judge Alito the full opportunity to address the concerns of 280 million Americans on probing questions which will be put to him by 18 Senators representing their diverse constituencies. I have reserved my own vote on this nomination until the hearing is concluded. I am committed as Chairman to a full, fair, and dignified hearing. Hearings for a Supreme Court nominee should not have a political tilt for either Republicans or Democrats. They should be in substance and in perception for all Americans.
There is no firmly established rule as to how much a nominee must say to be confirmed. While I personally consider it inappropriate to ask the nominee how he would vote on a specific matter likely to come before the Court, Senators may ask whatever they choose, and the nominee is similarly free to respond as he chooses. It has been my experience that the hearings are really, in effect, a subtle minuet, with the nominee answering as many questions as he thinks necessary in order to be confirmed.
Last year, when President Bush had two vacancies to fill, there was concern expressed that there might be an ideological change in the Court. The preliminary indications from Chief Justice Roberts’s performance on the Court and his Judiciary Committee testimony on modesty, stability, and not jolting the system all suggest that he will not move the Court in a different direction. If that holds true, Judge Alito, if confirmed, may not be the swing vote regardless of what position Judge Alito takes on the political spectrum.
Perhaps the dominant issue in these hearings is the widespread concern about Judge Alito’s position on a woman’s right to choose. This has arisen in part because of a 1985 statement made by Judge Alito that the Constitution does not provide for the right to an abortion. It has arisen in part because of his advocacy in the Solicitor General’s office seeking to limit or overrule Roe and from the dissenting portion of his opinion in Casey v. Planned Parenthood in the Third Circuit.
This hearing will give Judge Alito the public forum to address the issue as he has with Senators in private meetings, that his personal views and prior advocacy will not determine his judicial decisions, but instead he will weigh factors such as stare decisis, that is, what are the precedents; that he will weigh women’s and men’s reliance on Roe and he will consider too whether Roe is ‘‘embedded in the culture of our Nation.’’
The history of the Court is full of surprises on the issue. The major case upholding Roe was Casey v. Planned Parenthood, where the landmark opinion was written jointly by three Justices, Justice O’Connor, Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter. Before coming to the Court, Justice Souter, Justice Kennedy and Justice O’Connor, had all expressed views against a woman’s right to choose. David Souter, as Attorney General of New Hampshire, even opposed changing New Hampshire’s law prohibiting abortion even after the Supreme Court of the United States had declared it unconstitutional. At the time of Justice Souter’s confirmation hearing, there

was a stop Souter rally of the National Organization for Women a few blocks from where we currently are holding this hearing, displaying in red a banner ‘‘Stop Souter or Women Will Die,’’ ‘‘Stop Souter Rally, a Mass Lobbying Day,’’ somewhat similar to this morning’s press where banners are paraded in front of the Supreme Court ‘‘Save Roe’’ and a brochure circulated again by NOW, ‘‘Save Women’s Lives, Vote No on Alito.’’
The history of this issue has been one full of surprises. This hearing comes at a time of great national concern about the balance between civil rights and the President’s national security authority. The President’s constitutional powers as commander in chief to conduct electronic surveillance appear to conflict with what Congress has said in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This conflict involves very major considerations raised by Justice Jackson’s historic concurrence in the Youngstown Steel seizure cases, where Justice Jackson wrote, ‘‘When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right, and all that Congress can delegate. When the President acts in absence of a congressional grant of authority, he can rely only upon his own independent powers. When the President takes measures incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.’’ And as Justice Jackson noted, ‘‘What is at stake is the equilibrium established in our constitutional system.’’
Another major area of concern is congressional power, and in recent decisions the Supreme Court of the United States has declared Acts of Congress unconstitutional, really denigrating the role of Congress. In declaring unconstitutional legislation designed to protect women against violence, the Supreme Court did so notwithstanding a voluminous record in support of that legislation, but because of Congress’s ‘‘method of reasoning,’’ rather insulting to suggest that there is some superior method of reasoning in the Court.
When the Supreme Court handled two cases recently on the Americans with Disabilities Act, they upheld the Act as it applied to discrimination as to access, and declared it unconstitutional as it applied to discrimination in employment. They did so by applying a test of what is called ‘‘congruent and proportionate,’’ which candidly stated, no one can figure out. In dissent, Justice Scalia called it a flabby test, where the Court set itself up as the taskmaster to see if Congress had done its homework, and Justice Scalia said that it was an invitation to judicial arbitrariness by policy driven decisionmaking, and this hearing, I know, will involve consideration as to Judge Alito’s views on congressional power.
There is reason to believe that our Senate confirmation hearings may be having an effect on Supreme Court nominees on their later judicial duties. Years after their hearings, Supreme Court Justices talk to me about our dialogs at these hearings. This process has now evolved to a point where nominees meet most of the Senators. In this process, nominees get an earful. While no promises are extracted, statements are made by nominees which may well influence their judicial decisions. Chief Justice Roberts, for example, will have a tough time giving a jolt to the system after preaching modesty and stability. There is, I think, a heavy sense of drama

as these hearings begin. This is the quintessential example of separation of powers under our constitutional process, as the President nominates, the Senate confirms or rejects, and the successful nominee ascends to the bench. While it may be a bit presumptuous, I believe the Framers, if they were here, would be proud and pleased to see how well their Constitution is being applied.
My red light just went on, and I now yield to my distinguished colleague, Senator Leahy.
STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT
Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Judge and Mrs. Alito, and the others. Following up on what the Chairman was saying, the challenge for Judge Alito in the course of these hearings is to demonstrate that he is going to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans, and in doing that, serve as an effective check on Government overreaching. I have said that the President did not help his cause by withdrawing his earlier nomination of Harriet Miers in the face of criticism from a narrow faction of his own party who were concerned about how she might vote. Supreme Court nominations should not be conducted through a series of winks and nods designed to reassure a small faction of our population, while leaving the American people in the dark. And no President, I think we would all agree, should be allowed to pack the courts, and especially the Supreme Court, with nominees selected to enshrine Presidential claims of Government power. The checks and balances that should be provided by the courts, Congress and the Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to a narrow partisan agenda. This hearing is the opportunity for the American people to learn what Samuel Alito thinks about their fundamental constitutional rights and whether he—you, Judge—will protect their liberty, their privacy and their autonomy from Government intrusion. The Supreme Court belongs to all Americans, not just to the person occupying the White House, and not just to a narrow faction of either political party, because the Supreme Court is our ultimate check and balance. Independence of the Court and its members is crucial to our democracy and our way of life, and the Senate should never be allowed to be a rubber stamp. Neither should the Supreme Court. So I will ask the Judge to demonstrate his independence from the interests of the President nominating him. This is a nomination to a lifetime seat on the Nation’s highest Court. It is a seat that has often represented the decisive vote on constitutional issues, so we have to make an informed decision. That means knowing more about Samuel Alito’s work in the Government and knowing more about his views. I will, as the Judge knows, ask about the disturbing application he wrote to become a political appointee in the Meese Justice Department. In that application he professed concern with the fundamental principle of ‘‘one person, one vote,’’ a principle of the equality that is the bedrock of our laws. This hearing is the only opportunity that the American people and their representatives have to consider the suitability of the nominee to serve as a final arbiter

on the meaning of the Constitution and its laws. Has he demonstrated commitment to the fundamental rights of all Americans? Would he allow the Government to intrude on Americans’ personal privacy and freedoms?
In a time when this administration seems intent on accumulating unchecked power, Judge Alito’s views on Executive power are especially important. It is important to know whether he would serve with judicial independence or as a surrogate for the President nominating him. So this public conversation, this hearing over the next few days is extremely important. It is the people’s Constitution and the people’s right that we are all charged with protecting and preserving. In this hearing we embark on the constitutional process, one that was designed to protect these rights and has served this country so very well for more than two centuries.
I am reminded of a photograph, Mr. Chairman, that hangs in the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. It shows the first women ever to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States taking the oath of office in 1981. How Justice Sandra Day O’Connor serves is as a model Supreme Court Justice, widely recognized as a jurist with practical values and a sense of the consequences of the legal decisions being made by the Supreme Court. I regret that some on the extreme right have been so critical of Justice O’Connor, and that they adamantly oppose the naming of a successor who shares her judicial philosophy and qualities. Their criticism actually reflects poorly upon them. It does nothing to tarnish the record of the first woman to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She is a Justice whose graciousness and sense of duty fuels her continued service, even agreeing to serve more than 6 months after her retirement date, and I know both you and I commend her for that.
The Court that serves America should reflect America. This nomination was an opportunity, of course, for the President to make a nomination based on diversity. He did not, even though there is no dearth of highly qualified Hispanics and African-Americans, other individuals who could well have served as unifying nominees while adding to diversity. But that, of course, is the President’s choice, Judge, not yours. But I look forward to a time when the membership of the Supreme Court is more reflective of the country it serves.
As the Senate begins its consideration of President Bush’s nominee, his third to this seat, to Justice O’Connor’s seat, we do so mindful of her critical role in the Supreme Court. Her legacy is one of fairness, and when I decide how to vote it is because I want to see that legacy preserved. Justice O’Connor has been a guardian of the protections the Constitution provides the American people. She has come to provide balance and a check on Government intrusion into our personal privacy and freedoms. In the Hamdi decision she rejected the Bush administration’s claim that they could indefinitely detain a United States citizen. She upheld the fundamental principle of judicial review over the exercise of Government power, and she wrote—and this is one we should all remember—she wrote that even war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens. She held that even this President is not above the law, and of course, no President, Democratic

or Republican, no President is above the law, as neither are you, nor I, nor anyone in this room.
Her judgment has also been critical in protecting our environmental rights. She joined in 5–4 majorities affirming reproductive freedom, and religious freedom, and the Voting Rights Act. I mention each of these cases because they show how important a single Supreme Court Justice is, and it is crucial that we determine what kind of Justice Samuel Alito would be if confirmed. Of course, Judge, my question will be, will you be an independent jurist?
It is as the elected representatives of the American people, all of the people, nearly 300 million people, that we in the Senate are charged with the responsibility to examine whether to entrust their precious rights and liberties to this nominee. The Constitution is their document. It guarantees their rights from the heavy hand of Government intrusion, and individual liberties, to freedom of speech, to religion, to equal treatment, to due process and to privacy. Actually, this hearing, this is their process. The Federal Judiciary is unlike the other branches of Government. Once confirmed, a Federal Judge serves for life, and there is no court above the Supreme Court. The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who can demonstrate that he or she will not be beholden to the President, but only to the law.
Last October, the President succumbed to partisan pressure from the extreme right of his party by withdrawing Harriet Miers. By withdrawing her nomination and substituting this one, the President has allowed his choice to be vetoed by an extreme faction within his party before even a hearing or a vote. Frankly, that was an eye-opening experience to me. It gives the impression there are those who do not want an independent Federal Judiciary. They demand judges who will guarantee the results that they want, and that is why the questions will be asked so specifically of you, Judge.
The nomination is being considered against the backdrop of another recent revelation, that the President has, outside the law, been conducting secret and warrantless spying on Americans for more than 4 years. This is a time when the protections of America’s liberties are directly at risk, as are the checks and balances that serve to constrain abuses of power for more than 200 years. The Supreme Court is relied upon by all of us to protect our fundamental rights.
I have not decided how I will vote in this nomination, and like the Chairman, I will base my determination on the whole record at the conclusion of these hearings, just as I did in connection with the nomination of John Roberts to be Chief Justice. At the conclusion of those hearings I determined to vote for him.
The stakes for the American people could not be higher. At this critical moment, Senate Democrats serving on this Committee will perform our constitutional advice and consent responsibility with heightened vigilance. I would urge all Senators, Republicans and Democrats and Independents, to join with us in serious consideration. The appointment of the next Supreme Court Justice must be made in the people’s interest and in the Nation’s interest, not in the interest of any partisan faction.
Mr. Chairman, Thank you very much.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH
Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome you, Judge Alito, your family members, friends and others who are accompanying you. This hearing is part of an ongoing evaluation of Judge Samuel Alito’s nomination to replace Justice Sandra Day O’Connor as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is remarkable that after a nearly record-long period without a Supreme Court vacancy, we are here considering a second nominee in less than 6 months. Mr. Chairman, let me first commend you for firmly and fairly handling these hearings. The timetable we are following reflects your efforts to accommodate all sides, and the 70 days since President Bush announced the nomination significantly exceeds the average for other Supreme Court nominees. The debate over this and other judicial nominations is a debate over the judiciary itself. It is a debate over how much power unelected judges should have in our system of government, how much control judges should have over a written Constitution that belongs to the people. Ending up in the right place in this debate requires starting in the right place. The right place to start is the proper description of what judges are supposed to do, and the rest of the process should reflect this judicial job description. The process for evaluating Judge Alito’s nomination began when President Bush announced it more than 2 months ago. It continued with Judge Alito’s meetings with more than two-thirds of the Senators and a vigorous debate in the media among analysts, scholars, and activists. As the Senate completes the evaluation process, we must keep some very important principles in mind and follow a few basic rules. The first principle is that in this judicial selection process, the Senate and the President have different roles. Under the Constitution, the President, not the Senate, nominates and appoints judges. The Senate has a different role. We must give our advice about whether President Bush should actually appoint Judge Alito by giving or withholding our consent. Abiding by the Constitution’s design and our own historical tradition requires that after Judge Alito’s nomination reaches the Senate floor, we vigorously debate it and then vote up or down. The second principle is that in our system of Government the judicial and legislative branches have different roles. As Chief Justice Roberts described it when he was before this Committee last fall, ‘‘Judges are not politicians. Judges must decide cases, not champion causes. Judges must settle legal disputes, not pursue agendas. Judges must interpret and apply the law, not make the law.’’ This principle that judges are not politicians lies at the very heart of the judicial job description. In addition to these two principles, a few basic rules should guide how we complete this confirmation process. First, we must remember that judicial nominees are constrained in what they may dis-

cuss and how they may discuss it. Like Chief Justice Roberts and others before him, Judge Alito is already a Federal judge. He not only will be bound by the canons of judicial ethics as a Supreme Court Justice, he is already bound by these canons as an appeals court judge. Because judges may not issue advisory opinions, judicial nominees may not do so either, especially on issues likely to come before the Court. That rule has always been honored.
Needless to say, those who will demand such advisory opinions in this hearing will do so precisely on those issues that are likely to come before the Court. They have a right to ask those questions. But as the Washington Post editorialized just this morning, however, ‘‘he will not—and should not—tell Americans how he will vote on hotly contested issues.’’
When Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg was before us in 1993, she said that her standard was to give no hints, no forecasts, no previews, and declined to answer dozens of questions.
The second rule we should follow is to consider each part of Judge Alito’s record on its own terms for what each part actually is. He wrote memos when he worked for the Justice Department. He has written judicial opinions while on the appeals court. He wrote answers to the questionnaire from this Committee in 1990 and again last year. He has written articles and given speeches. He has joined certain groups, and each of these is different. Each of these must be considered in its own context, on its own terms, rather than squeezed, twisted, and distorted into something designed instead to support a preconceived position or serve a preplanned agenda.
The third rule we should follow is considering Judge Alito’s entire record. Some interest groups focus on—some would say they obsess about—one recusal question, or they cherrypick from the thousands of cases in which Judge Alito participated and the hundreds of opinions he authored or joined. Or they look at the results that ignore the facts and the law in those cases.
Judge Alito comes to us with a record that is long, broad, and deep. He deserves, and our constitutional duty requires, that we consider his entire record.
Finally, and perhaps most important, we must apply a judicial rather than a political standard to the information before us, and we do have a lot of information. The record includes more than 360 opinions of all kinds—majority, concurring, and dissenting—written during his judicial tenure. We have more than 36,000 pages of additional material, including unpublished opinions, legal briefs, articles, speeches, and Department of Justice documents relating to his service in the Office of Legal Counsel and in the Solicitor General’s office. We must apply a judicial, not a political, standard to this record. Asking a judicial nominee whose side you will be on in future cases is a political standard. Evaluating Judge Alito’s record by asking those whose side he has been on in past cases is, again, a political standard.
Scorecards are common in the political process, but they are inappropriate in the judicial process. The most important tools in the judicial confirmation process are not litmus paper and a calculator. Applying a proper judicial standard to Judge Alito’s record means putting aside the scorecards and looking at how he does what

judges are supposed to do, namely, settle legal disputes by applying already established law.
A judicial standard means that a judicial decision can be entirely correct even when the result does not line up with our preferred political positions or cater to certain political interests. When he was here last fall, Chief Justice Roberts compared judges to umpires who apply rules they did not write and cannot change to the competition before them. We do not evaluate an umpire’s performance based on which team won the game, but on how that umpire applied the rules inning after inning. We do not hire umpires by showing them the roster for the upcoming season and demanding to know which teams they will favor before those teams even take the field. Similarly, we should evaluate judges and judicial nominees based on the general process for applying the law to any legal disputes, not on the specific result in a particular case or dispute.
The fact that Judge Alito is such a baseball fan gives me even more confidence that he knows the proper role of a judge. I know that there is a pitched battle going on outside the Senate, with dueling press conferences, television ads, e-mail, petition drives, and stacks of reports and press releases. The Senate can rise above that battle if we remember the proper role for the Senate and the proper role for judges. We can rise above that battle if we respect that judicial nominees are limited in what they may discuss. Take each part of Judge Alito’s record on its own terms. Consider Judge Alito’s entire record and apply a judicial rather than a political standard.
Judge Alito, I know you. I have known you for a long time. You are a good man. You are an exceptional judge as well. I welcome you and your family to this Committee, and I hope that the days ahead will reflect more light than heat. We congratulate you that you are willing to go through this grueling process to represent your country on one of the three separated powers. It means so much to all of us, and I am grateful to personally know you as well as I do.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy?
STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. KENNEDY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS
Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, I join in welcoming you and your family to this Committee. I appreciated the opportunity to visit with you in my office a few weeks ago, and I was particularly impressed by your personal family story of how you were encouraged to do well and contribute to your community. And I also applaud your dedication to public service throughout your lifetime. Supreme Court nominations are an occasion to pause and reflect on the values that make our Nation strong, just, and fair. And we must determine whether a nominee has a demonstrated commitment to those basic values. Will a nominee embrace and uphold the essential meaning of the four words inscribed above the entrance of the Supreme Court Building, ‘‘Equal justice under law.’’

Justice Louis Powell spoke for all of us when he said, ‘‘Equal justice under law is perhaps the most inspiring idea of our society. It is one of the ends for which our entire legal system exists.’’
As we have seen from Justice O’Connor’s example, even one Justice can profoundly alter the meaning of those words for our citizens. Even one Justice can deeply affect the rights and liberties of the American people. Even one Justice can advance or reverse the progress of our journey.
So the question before us in these hearings is this: does Judge Alito’s record hold true to the letter and the spirit of equal justice? Is he committed to the core values of our Constitution that are at the heart of our Nation’s progress, and can he truly be evenhanded and fair in his decisions?
In a way Judge Alito has faced this issue before as a nominee to the Court of Appeals. I had the privilege of chairing his confirmation hearing in 1990, and at that time he had practiced law for 14 years, but only represented one client, the U.S. Government. I asked whether he believed he could be impartial in deciding cases involving the Government, and in that hearing Judge Alito said on the record that the most important quality for a judge is openmindedness to the arguments, and he promised the Committee that he would make a very conscious effort to be absolutely impartial. We took him at his word and overwhelmingly confirmed him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
We now have the record of Judge Alito’s 15 years on the bench, and the benefit of some of his earlier writings that were not available 15 years ago, and I regret to say that the record troubles me deeply.
In a era where the White House is abusing power, is excusing and authorizing torture and is spying on American citizens, I find Judge Alito’s support for an all-powerful executive branch to be genuinely troubling. Under the President’s spying program there are no checks and balances. There is no outside review of the legality of this brazen infringement on the civil rights and liberties of the American people. Undeterred by the public outcry, the President vows to continue spying on American citizens. Ultimately the courts will make the final judgment whether the White House has gone too far. Independent and impartial judges must assess the proper balance between protecting our liberties and protecting our national security.
I am gravely concerned by Judge Alito’s clear record of support for vast Presidential authority unchecked by the other two branches of Government. In decision after decision on the bench, he has excused abusive actions by the authorities that intrude on the personal privacy and freedoms of average Americans, and in his writings and speeches he has supported a level of overreaching Presidential power that, frankly, most Americans find disturbing and even frightening.
In fact, it is extraordinary that each of the three individuals this President has nominated for the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roberts, Harriet Miers and now Judge Alito, has served not only as a lawyer for the executive branch, but as a defendant of the most expansive view of Presidential authority. Perhaps that is why this President nominated them. But as Justice O’Connor stated, even a

state of war is not a blank check for a President to do whatever he wants. The Supreme Court must serve as an independent check on abuses by the executive branch and a protector of our liberties, not a cheerleader for an imperial presidency.
There are other areas of concern. In an era when too many Americans are losing their jobs or working for less, trying to make ends meet, in close cases Judge Alito has ruled the vast majority of the time against the claims of the individual citizens. He has acted instead in favor of Government, large corporations and other powerful interests. In a study by the well-respected expert, Professor Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School, Judge Alito was found to rule against the individual in 84 percent of his dissents. To put it plainly, average Americans have had a hard time getting a fair shake in his courtroom. In an era when America is still too divided by race and riches, Judge Alito has not written one single opinion on the merits in favor of a person of color alleging race discrimination on the job; in 15 years on the bench, not one.
When I look at that record in light of the 1985 job application to the Reagan Justice Department, it is even more troubling. That document lays out an ideological agenda that highlights his pride in belonging to an alumni group at Princeton that opposed the admission of women and proposed to curb the admission of racial minorities. It proclaims his legal opinion that the Constitution does not protect the right of women to make their own reproductive decisions. It expresses outright hostility to the basic principle of one person, one vote, affirmed by the Supreme Court as essential to ensuring that all Americans have a voice in their Government. This application was not a youthful indiscretion. It was a document prepared by a mature, 35-year-old professional.
Finally, many of us are concerned about conflicting statements that Judge Alito has made in response to questions from this Committee and others. As Chairman Specter has stated, this confirmation largely depends on the credibility of Judge Alito’s statements to us, and we have questions. When asked about the ideological statements and specific legal opinions in his 1985 application, Judge Alito has dismissed those statements as just applying for a job.
When he was before this Committee in 1990 applying for a job to the circuit, he promised under oath that he would recuse himself from cases involving Vanguard, the mutual fund company in which he had most of his investments. But as a judge he participated in a Vanguard case anyway, and has offered many conflicting reasons to explain why he broke his word. We need to get to the bottom of this matter to assure ourselves that what Judge Alito says in these hearings will not be just words, but pledges that guide him in the future if he is confirmed.
Judges are appointed by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and it is our duty to ask questions on great issues that matter to the American people and to speak for them. Many Republican Senators certainly demanded answers from Harriet Miers. We should expect no less from Judge Alito. There is not time for a double standard. If confirmed, Judge Alito could serve on the Court for a generation or more, and the decisions he will make as

Justice will have a direct impact on the lives and liberties of our children, our grandchildren and even our great-grandchildren. We have only one chance to get it right, and a solemn obligation to do so.
Judge Alito, I have serious questions to ask. I congratulate you on your nomination, and I look forward to your answers in these hearings.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Grassley.
STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA
Senator GRASSLEY. I have a much more positive view of Judge Alito.
[Laughter.] Senator GRASSLEY. I think the record will sustain my view. But first, Judge Alito, I welcome you and your proud family to the Committee, and congratulations on your nomination. I first want to remind all Americans who might be listening that the Senate has a very important responsibility to confirm only wellqualified individuals who will faithfully interpret the law and the Constitution. Confirmation should be limited to those individuals who will be fair, unbiased, devoted to addressing the facts in the law before them without imposing their own values and political beliefs when deciding cases. Nominees should not be expected to precommit to ruling on certain issues in a certain way, nor should Senators ask nominees to pledge to rule on cases in a particular way. If we fulfill our responsibility to the Constitution, the Supreme Court will be filled with superior legal minds who will pursue the one agenda that our Founding Fathers intended in writing the Constitution, justice rather than political or personal goals. The Supreme Court will then consists of individuals who meticulously apply the law and the Constitution regardless of whether the results they reach are popular or not. If we do our job right, the Supreme Court will not be made up of men and women who are on the side of the little guy or the big guy, rather the Supreme Court will be made up of men and women who are on the side of the law and the Constitution. From all accounts, Judge Alito has an impressive and extensive legal and judicial record, certainly one worthy of someone on the Supreme Court. Judge Alito excelled at top-notch schools, member of law review, clerked for a Federal judge. He also held important positions at the Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel, the Solicitor General’s Office and was U.S. Attorney for New Jersey before being appointed to the Third Circuit. I want to remind the American people this nominee, Judge Alito, has been confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate, not once, but twice. This is a tremendous record of accomplishment in public service equal to any Supreme Court nominee that I have considered in the 25 years I have been on this Committee. Not only that, Judge Alito has a reputation for being an exceptional and honest judge devoted to the rule of law, as well as being a man of integrity.

Judge Alito enjoys the support and respect of people who work with him, practice with him, and therefore, know him best. Example, 54 of Judge Alito’s law clerks, Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, signed a letter to the Committee that stated, ‘‘We collectively were involved in thousands of cases and it never once appeared to us that Judge Alito has prejudged a case or ruled based on political ideology.’’ Continuing to quote, ‘‘It is our uniform experience that Judge Alito was guided by his profound respect for the Constitution and the limited role of the judicial branch.’’ Those 54 opinions say a lot about Judge Alito and his approach to judicial function. Like Chief Justice Roberts, it appears that Judge Alito tries to act like an umpire, calling the balls and strikes, rather than advocating a particular outcome.
I am also impressed with the very complimentary things that some lawyers have had to say about Judge Alito in the Lawyers Evaluation Section of the Almanac of Federal Judiciary. With respect to his legal ability, lawyers praised him, saying that Judge Alito was ‘‘exceptional,’’ ‘‘a brilliant jurist.’’ Another lawyer stated that, ‘‘to say that he is outstanding is to use understatement. He’s the best judge on the circuit, maybe in the country.’’
With respect to his demeanor and temperament, lawyers found Judge Alito to be measured and judicial while on the bench. One lawyer commented that he is demanding, but always courteous. He may occasionally, quoting, ‘‘demonstrate a little bit of impatience with lawyers that aren’t quite getting it. This can be directed at either side. It’s just a sign that his mind is working more efficiently than yours. He’s never discourteous, never abusive.’’ Another lawyer said, ‘‘He is pleasant and courteous.’’ Others commented about the impression that Judge Alito is a conservative judge, but certainly not out to impose his own personal agenda while on the bench. One lawyer commented that he ‘‘is a conservative, but reaches honest decisions,’’ while another said, ‘‘By reputation he’s known to be one of the more conservative judges on the court, but he is forthright and fair. He tries to decide cases in front of him in the right way.’’
The American Bar Association came out just last week with an evaluation of Judge Alito to be a Justice, and they considered things like integrity, judgment, compassion, open-mindedness and freedom from bias and commitment to equal justice under the law. The ABA once again found Judge Alito to be unanimously well qualified. This recommendation should have much weight for my colleagues on the other side, who have time and time again described the rating of the ABA as, quote, ‘‘gold standard.’’ Yet, some liberal interest groups have come out in full force and have attempted to paint Judge Alito to be an extremist and to be an activist. They have criticized a nominee who has, from what I see described by these lawyers and fellow judges, a reputation of being a restrained jurist committed to the rule of law and the Constitution, but that is what these outside-the-mainstream groups always do.
They attack individuals who they believe will not implement their agenda before the Supreme Court, so Judge Alito should see criticism as a badge of honor worn by many past and present members of the Court. Yet, I am glad to see the public fully participate

in this process because this is the nature of our system of Government, but I do not like to see facts twisted, untruths fabricated to give the nominee a black eye even before he comes before our Committee.
So, Judge Alito, now you have that opportunity to set everyone straight on your record and your approach to deciding cases. These hearings are also an opportunity, a very good opportunity to remind the public about the proper role of a judge in our system of checks and balances limited Government. Judges are required by our democratic system not to overstep their positions to become policymakers or super legislators. Supreme Court nominees should know, without any doubt, that their job is not to impose their own personal opinions of what is right and wrong, but to say what the law is, rather than what they personally think the law ought to be. Supreme Court nominees should know that this exercise of judicial restraint is a key ingredient of being a good judge, as the Constitution constrains judges every bit as it constrains we legislators, executives and citizens in their actions.
Moreover, Supreme Court nominees should be individuals who not only understand but truly respect the equal roles and responsibilities of different branches of Government and our State Governments. As Alexander Hamilton said in Federalist No. 78, ‘‘The courts must decide the sense of the law, and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequences would be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.’’ Our Framers expected the judicial branch to be the least dangerous branch of Government.
At our meeting in my office in November, I heard Judge Alito place emphasis on the limited role of the courts in our democratic society. He also reiterated this belief in a questionnaire he submitted to this Committee. So I have some idea of how Judge Alito approaches the law and views the role of a judge. I am hopeful that his commitment to judicial restraint and to confining decisions to the law and the Constitution will shine through in this hearing, and I believe it will, and I am hopeful that my colleagues will give Judge Alito a civil, a fair and a dignified process, as well as an up or down vote, because as always, the Constitution sets the standard: the President nominates, the Senate deliberates, and then we are obligated to give our advice and consent in an up or down vote.
Judge Alito, I congratulate you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Grassley. Senator Biden.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE
Senator BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, welcome. Mrs. Alito and your family, welcome. It is an incredible honor to be nominated by a President of the United States to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and you are to be congratulated. Judge, this may be one of the most significant, consequential nominations that the Senate will vote on since I have been here in the last three decades. I think history has delivered you, fortunately or unfortunately, to a moment where Supreme Court histo-

rians far into the future are going to look back on this nomination and make a judgment whether or not with your nomination, and if you are confirmed, whether the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court begin to change from the consensus that existed the last 70 years, or whether it continued on the same path it has over the past six or seven decades, and that moment is right now.
Lest we think it is kind of like we all go through this process— and I like the phrase ‘‘minuet’’ that the Chairman used—we all act like there is not an elephant in the room. The truth of the matter is, there is significant debate among judicial scholars today as to whether or not we have gone off on the wrong path with regard to Supreme Court decisions. There is a very significant dispute that has existed in 5–4 decisions over the past two decades in a Court that is very closely divided on the critical, central issues of the day.
Just to make it clear, I am puzzled by some of the things you have said, and I am sure you are going to get a chance to tell me what you meant by some of the things you wrote and said, but when in your job application you talked about being proud, as you should be, to be proud of your subscription to and adhering to notions put forward in the National Review that you are a proud member of the Federalist Society, the National Conservative Political Action Committee, the American Spectator is something you look to, et cetera. These are all really very bright folks. They all have a very decided opinion on the issues of the day—very decided. And those very organizations I have named think, for example, we misread the Fifth Amendment and have been misreading it for the past three decades. Those same groups argue that, in fact, there is no right of privacy in the Constitution, et cetera. So people are not making this up. In a sense, it is not about you. You find yourself in the middle of one of the most significant national debates in modern constitutional history because you have been nominated to replace a woman, in addition, who has been the deciding vote on a significant number of these cases. Since 1995 there have been 193 5–4 decisions, and Justice O’Connor 77 percent of the time has been the deciding vote. And for 70 years, there has been a consensus among scholars and the American people on a reading of the Constitution that protects the right of privacy, the autonomy of individuals, while at the same time empowering the Federal Government to protect the less powerful. Only recently has the debate come that States rights are being trumped in a fundamental way, a reading of the 10th Amendment and 11th Amendment. That is a legitimate debate. Totally legitimate. But anybody who pretends that how you read the 10th and 11th Amendment does not have a fundamental impact on the things we care about is kidding themselves. They are either uninformed or they are kidding themselves.
So, Judge, there is a genuine struggle going on well beyond you, well beyond the Congress, in America about how to read the Constitution. And I believe at its core we have a Constitution, as our Supreme Court’s first great Justice Marshall said in 1819, and I quote, ‘‘intended to endure for the ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.’’ That is the crux of the debate we are having now, whether it is an adaptable Constitution. A lot of my friends make very powerful and con-

vincing arguments—and they may be right—that, no, no, no, no, no, it is not adaptable, it is not adaptable. And since our country’s founding, we have tried to keep Government’s heavy hand out of our personal lives while ensuring that we do the most important thing, which is to protect those who cannot protect themselves. And the debate raging today is about whether we will continue along that path and whether our courts will continue to be one of the places where society puts the little guy—and I know this is not something you are supposed to say—the little guy on the same footing with the big guy. The one place David is equal to Goliath is in the Supreme Court.
It is also important to note that you are slated to replace the first woman ever nominated to the Supreme Court. We can pretend that is not the fact, but it is. And through no fault of your own, we are cutting the number of women in half on the Court. And now, as I said, that is not your fault, but I think it means that we have to take, at least speaking for myself, a closer look at your stands on issues that are important to women. And, moreover, Justice O’Connor brought critical qualities to the High Court that not everybody thinks are qualities—I happen to think they are—her pragmatism and her statecraft. Not that I have always agreed with what she said, far from it, but Justice O’Connor has been properly lauded in my view as a judge who approached her duties with open-mindedness and with a sensitivity to the effects her decisions would have on everyday, ordinary people. She, unlike Judge Bork, did not think that being on the Court would be ‘‘an intellectual feast,’’ to quote Judge Bork. Justice O’Connor also brought balance to our highest Court. Most recently, as has been repeated many times, she cautioned about war does not give a blank check. Her decisions reflect, in my view, that our societies work very hard to improve the workaday world, to open doors to workers confronted by powerful employers and for women facing harassment and stereotypes.
Now, I acknowledge this is a very tough job a judge has in determining whether or not there is an openness that is required under the Constitution. But I also acknowledge that prejudice runs very deep in our society, and in the real world, discrimination rears its ugly head in the shadows where it is very difficult to root it out. But Justice O’Connor was not afraid to go into the shadows.
The Constitution provides for one democratic moment, Judge, before a lifetime of judicial independence when the people of the United States are entitled to know as much as we can about the person that we are about to entrust with safeguarding our future and the future of our kids. And, Judge, simply put, that is this moment, the one democratic moment in a lifetime of absolute judicial independence. And that is what these hearings are about, in my view.
In the coming days, we want to know about what you believe, Judge, how you view the Constitution, how you envision the role of the Federal courts, what kind of Justice you would seek to become. As I said, this one democratic moment when the people, through their elected representatives, get to ask questions of a President’s choice for the highest Court. And I hope you will be forthcoming.

I cannot imagine, notwithstanding what many of my colleagues, whom I have great respect for, believe, I can’t imagine the Founders, when they sat down and wrote the document and got to the Appointments Clause and said, You know what? The American people are entitled to know before we make him President, before we make her Senator, before we make him Congressman, what they believe on the major issues of the day. But judges, Supreme Court nominees, as long as they are smart and honest and decent, it really does not matter what they think. We do not have to know. I can’t fathom—can’t fathom—that that was the intent of the Founders. They intended the American people to know what their nominees thought.
And I might add—and I will end with this—we just had two Supreme Court Justices before our caucus just as they were before, I think, the Republican Caucus. They ventured opinions on everything. On everything, things that are going to come before the Court. It did not in any way jeopardize their judicial independence.
So, Judge, I really hope that this does not turn out to be a minuet. I hope it turns out to be a conversation. I believe we—you and I and this Committee—owe it to the American people in this one democratic moment to have a conversation about the issues that will affect their lives profoundly. They are entitled to know what you think.
And I remind my colleagues, many of whom are on this Committee, they sure wanted to know what Harriet Miers thought about everything. They sure wanted to know in great detail. They were about ready to administer blood tests. The good news is no blood test here. The good news is no blood test, just a conversation, and I hope you will engage in it with us because I am anxious to get a sense of how you are going to approach these big issues.
I thank you very much, Judge. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Biden. Senator Kyl?
STATEMENT OF HON. JON KYL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA
Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Judge Alito, to your confirmation hearing. At the outset, I am pleased to note that you have more judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in more than 70 years. Indeed, only one Supreme Court Justice in history, one Horace Lurton, nominated by President Taft, had more Federal appeals court experience. Moreover, you have devoted virtually your entire professional life to public service, and the Nation owes you gratitude for that service. I look forward to a dignified hearing followed by a fair up or down vote on the Senate floor. Before discussing your nomination, I would like to take a moment to express my respect and admiration for the Justice whom you are nominated to replace, my fellow Arizonan Sandra Day O’Connor, whom I have known for more than 30 years. Justice O’Connor has served with great distinction during her career in the Arizona Legislature, on the Arizona Court of Appeals, and for what has been a quarter of a century on the U.S. Supreme Court. Arizonans are deeply proud of Justice O’Connor’s service to this country.

19
She will always be remembered by Arizonans and all Americans as an extraordinary public servant.
Judge Alito, I would like to discuss your background and experience in the context of other Justices on the Supreme Court so that everyone understands how well you satisfy what we have come to expect from our top judges. Like all the sitting Justices, you had an outstanding education. One of your classmates at Yale Law School, Tony Kronman, who later went on to be the dean of the law school and could, I believe, fairly be described as a political liberal, has recently remarked, and I quote, ‘‘He impressed me’’—speaking of you—‘‘as being more interested in the technical, intellectual challenges of the law and its legal reasoning than its political uses or ramifications.’’ Thus, even in your early 20’s, it appears you were focused on the law as an independent pursuit rather than using law to influence political ends.
With your intellect and education, you could have become a wealthy attorney, but instead you devoted virtually all of your legal career to the public service. In doing so, you meet, and even exceed, the stellar examples set by Justices Thomas and Souter, each of whom devoted most of their pre-judicial careers to public service. Perhaps this is because, like Justices Ginsburg and Scalia, you had a father who was an immigrant to this Nation. It seems that immigrants often have a special understanding of the incredible opportunities that this Nation affords its citizens. Moreover, your father’s long service to the people of New Jersey both as a schoolteacher and as a civil servant in the State legislature plainly served as a model for you.
I also note that you served in the U.S. Army Reserves from 1972 until 1980. If confirmed, only you and Justice Stevens would have any military experience. You would also be the first Supreme Court Justice to have served in the Army Reserves since Justice Frank Murphy did so during World War II.
You have spent much of your career as a Federal prosecutor pursuing terrorists, mob kingpins, drug dealers, and others who threaten our safety and our security. Justice Souter had a distinguished career as a State prosecutor, but no sitting Justice has served as a Federal prosecutor. Again, this experience could prove helpful given that approximately 40 percent of the Supreme Court docket involves criminal matters.
You also served as an attorney in the executive branch. Like Chief Justice Roberts, you served in the Solicitor General’s office representing our Government before the Supreme Court. And like Justice Scalia, you served in the Office of Legal Counsel, providing constitutional advice to the President and the rest of the executive branch. In both of these roles, your job was to advance the policies of a President who twice won an electoral college landslide. He set the agenda, and you helped him implement it.
Similarly, Justice Thomas served Presidents Reagan and Bush in political/legal capacities, and Justice Breyer also worked in political jobs, both in President Johnson’s Justice Department and as a lawyer to this Committee.
I note that you were just 39 when nominated to serve on the Third Circuit. Justice Kennedy was only 38 when nominated to the Ninth Circuit, and Justice Breyer only 42 when nominated to the

20
First Circuit. Like them, you now have a great deal of hands-on experience that you can bring to the Court for years to come.
During your judicial service, you amassed an impressive record for the Senate to review, including more than 350 authored opinions. It is this judicial record that should be the focus of this Committee, just as it was with all of the other sitting Justices on the Court. It appears to me that you easily fit into the mold of what this Nation has come to expect from a Supreme Court Justice: a first-rate intellect, demonstrated academic excellence, a life of engagement with serious constitutional analysis, and a reputation for fair-mindedness and modesty. These are the standards for a Supreme Court Justice, and you plainly meet these expectations. As a consequence, I view your nomination with a heavy presumption in favor of confirmation. Before I conclude, I would like, though, to address two other points.
First, some of my colleagues are fond of asking the question, Which side are you on? You have heard that today. Politicians must pick sides regularly, every time they vote, so it is perhaps natural that they see the world as a battle between competing groups. But it is wholly inappropriate as an approach to the judicial role. The only relevant side is that of the law and the Constitution. We do great injury to the integrity of the court system when we start speaking of sides and stop devoting ourselves to the pursuit of impartial justice.
During Chief Justice Roberts’s confirmation hearings, I was struck by the way he answered the question. Then Judge Roberts explained that he had been asked earlier in the confirmation process, Are you going to be on the side of the little guy? Roberts explained that this question troubled him, and this is how he answered. He said, ‘‘If the Constitution says that the little guy should win, the little guy is going to win. But if the Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then the big guy is going to win because my obligation is to the Constitution. That’s the oath. The oath that a judge takes is not that I will look out for particular interests. The oath is to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the United States.’’ And this is the essence of justice. Our courts provide a neutral forum for the adjudication of disputes under the law, not based on economic or political power, on race, on sex, or any other personal characteristics. Big guy, little guy—it should make no difference. The rule of law demands neutrality.
Second, I want to address the proper scope of questioning during these hearings, a matter that has also come up already. As I reminded Chief Justice Roberts at his hearings, the American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct dictates that, and I quote, ‘‘a judge or candidate for election or appointment to judicial office shall not, with respect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come before the court, make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office.’’ In other words, no judicial nominee should answer any question that is designed to reveal how the nominee will rule on any issue that could come before the Court. This rule has come to be known as ‘‘the Ginsburg standard’’ because Justice Ginsburg stated during her own confirmation hearings that she would give no forecasts, no hints about how she
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00032 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.000 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

21
would rule on issues. And I was pleased to see that Chief Justice Roberts refused to prejudge issues or make promises in exchange for confirmation votes. We are all better off because of his principled stand.
Soon after his confirmation, Justice Ginsburg was asked about this Ginsburg standard as applied to the Roberts hearings, and she said, ‘‘Judge Roberts was unquestionably right. My rule was I will not answer a question that attempts to project how I will rule in a case that might come before the Court.’’ In other words, Justice Ginsburg reaffirmed the Ginsburg standard.
In light of the Chief Justice’s confirmation hearings and Justice Ginsburg’s later remarks, I asked my colleagues for basic fair play. Apply the same standards to Judge Alito that we applied to John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and all of the other sitting Justices. Let’s not invent a new standard for Judge Alito or change the rules in the middle of the game. Politicians must let voters know what they think about issues before the election. Judges should not.
And it is not a hypothetical matter. Senator Kennedy in his opening statement expressed concern about the extent of the executive branch’s authority to conduct surveillance of terrorists and said ultimately the courts will decide whether the President has gone too far. Indeed they will.
Judge Alito, I will tell you the same thing I told John Roberts. I expect you to adhere to the Code of Judicial Conduct, and I want you to know that I will strongly defend your refusal to give any indication of how you might rule on any matter that might come before you as a judge or to answer any question that you believe to be improper under the circumstances. Congratulations, Judge Alito, on your nomination.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kyl. Senator Kohl?
STATEMENT OF HON. HERBERT KOHL, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN
Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, let me also send my welcome to you this afternoon and to your family. You are to be congratulated on your nomination. Through its interpretation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court hugely shapes the fabric of our society for us and for future generations. Over the course of more than 200 years, it has found a right to equal education regardless of race. It has guaranteed an attorney and a fair trial to all Americans, rich and poor alike. It has allowed women to keep private medical decisions private. And it has allowed Americans to speak, vote, and worship without interference from their Government. Through these decisions and many more, the judicial branch has in its finest hours stood firmly on the side of individuals against those who would trample their rights. In the words of Justice Black, ‘‘The courts stand against any winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered, or because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice or public excitement.’’

As the guardian of our rights, the Supreme Court makes decisions every year which either protect the individual or leave him at the mercy of more powerful forces in our society. They consider questions like when can a disabled individual sue to gain access to a courthouse, when can a parent leave work to care for a sick child, when should the Government be allowed to listen to a private conversation, and when will the courthouse doors open or close to an employee suffering discrimination at work.
Whether interpreting the Constitution or filling in the blanks of a law or a regulation, every word of the Court’s opinion can widen or narrow our rights as Americans and either protect us or leave us more vulnerable to any winds that blow. If confirmed, you will write the words that will either broaden or narrow our rights for the rest of your working life. You will be interpreting the Constitution in which we as a people place our faith and on which our freedoms as a Nation rest. And on a daily basis, the words of your opinions will affect countless individuals as they seek protection behind the courthouse doors.
Despite your enormous power, you will be free of all constraints, unaccountable and unrecallable. We give Supreme Court Justices this freedom because we expect them to remain above the pull of politics, to avoid the effects of public excitement and allow a broader view, not tied to the whims of the majority at a certain moment in the history. So for only a short time this month will the people through their Senators be able to question and to judge you. In short, before we give you the keys to the car, we would like to know where you plan to take us.
To a certain extent, we know more about what is in your heart and in your mind than we did with now Justice Roberts. You have a long track record as a judge and as a public official in the Justice Department. When we met privately and I asked you what sort of Supreme Court Justice you would make, your answer was fair when you said, ‘‘If you want to know what sort of a Justice I would make, then look at what sort of a judge I have been.’’
Taking this advice, your critics argue that your judicial record demonstrates that you will not sufficiently protect the individual, but will instead side with more powerful interests, narrow the rights we enjoy, and leave individual Americans more vulnerable to abuse. For example, they cite your Casey dissent as diminishing the power of married women over their own bodies. They identify your decision in the Chittister case as evidence that you will make it harder for working people to care for a family. They cite the Bray case and others where you often side with corporations to block the victims of discrimination from getting their day in court. Others raise concerns about your views on the rights of the accused when faced with the Government’s enormous power in the criminal justice process.
In addition to your record on the bench, your opponents identify memos you wrote while in the Justice Department as further evidence of your hostility to individual rights. For example, in your now famous 1985 job application, you expressed pride in some of the work you did in the Solicitor General’s office. You chose to single out the assistance that you provided in crafting Supreme Court briefs urging that ‘‘the Constitution does not protect a right to an

abortion.’’ While these statements came in the context of your work on behalf of the Reagan administration, they were, nevertheless, your self-proclaimed personal views.
In the same job application, you wrote that you had pursued a legal career because you disagreed with many of the decisions of the Warren Court, especially, and I quote, ‘‘in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.’’ These Warren Court decisions establishing one person/one vote, Miranda rights, and protections for religious minorities are some of the most important cases protecting our rights and our liberties, protecting minorities against majority abuses and protecting individuals against Government abuses, and yet antagonism toward these decisions seems to have motivated your pursuit of the law.
Your supporters, on the other hand, contend that it is not fair to select a few specific cases in light of a career as a judge spanning 15 years. Further, they dismiss some of your early memos in the Justice Department as old and not particularly relevant. They argue that you are well within the mainstream of judges, especially Republican-appointed judges.
So it is our job to sort out the truth about your record, separate the rhetoric from the reality, and decide where you will lead the country. We will need to examine whether, as your critics contend, you will consistently side against the individual or whether, as your supporters contend, you are a mainstream conservative who will fairly decide all cases. I hope these hearings will add to our record in making this critical determination.
This would be an appropriate time to share my perspective on how we will judge the nominee. We have used the same test for each of the five previous Supreme Court nomination hearings: a test of judicial excellence. Judicial excellence, it seems to me, involves at least four elements:
First, a nominee must possess the competence, character, and temperament to serve on the bench.
Second, judicial excellence means that a Supreme Court Justice must have a sense of the values from which the core of our political and economic system goes. In other words, we should not approve any nominee whose extreme judicial philosophy would undermine rights and liberties relied upon by all Americans.
Third, judicial excellence requires an understanding that the law is more than an intellectual game and more than a mental exercise. He or she must recognize that real people with real problems are affected by the decisions rendered by the Court. Justice, after all, may be blind, but it should not be deaf.
And, finally, judicial excellence requires candor before confirmation. We are being asked to give the nominee enormous power, and so we want to know what is in your mind and in your heart.
Judge Alito, we are convinced that your intellect and experience qualifies you for this position. I enjoyed meeting you a few weeks ago and appreciated our discussion. Your legal talents are undeniably impressive, and your opinions are thoughtful and well reasoned. We are now familiar with your abilities in your long tenure as a judge. And yet we do not know whether the concerns some have raised about your judicial philosophy are overstated or whether we need to have serious doubts about your nomination. I look

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kohl. Senator DeWine.
STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE DEWINE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO
Senator DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, I want to welcome you and your family, appreciate you being here with us today. The Constitution gives the Senate a solemn duty, a solemn duty when it comes to the nomination of any individual to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court. While the President is to nominate that individual, we in the Senate must provide our advice and consent. This function is not well defined. The Constitution does not set down a road map. It does not require hearings. In fact, it does not even require questioning on your understanding of the Constitution or the role of the Supreme Court. To me, however, these things are certainly important. The reason is obvious. When it comes to the Supreme Court, the American people have only two times when they have any input into how our Constitution is interpreted and who will have the privilege to do so. First, we elect a President who has the power to nominate Justices to the Supreme Court. Second, the people, acting through their representatives in the Senate, have their say on whether the President’s nominee should in fact be confirmed. Judge Alito, I want to use our time together today to make a point about democracy. When it comes to our Constitution, judges perform certainly an important role. But the people, acting through their elected representatives, should play an even more important role. After all, our Constitution was intended as a popular document. It was drafted and ratified by the people. It established democratic institutions. It entrusts the people with the power to make the tough decisions. In most cases, it prefers the will of the people to the unchecked rule of judges. If confirmed, Judge, you should always keep this in mind. In my opinion, Chief Justice Roberts put it best during his recent confirmation hearings, when he said, and I quote, ‘‘The Framers were not the sort of people, having fought a revolution, having fought a revolution to get the right of self government, to sit down and say, well, let’s take all the difficult issues before us, let’s have the judges decide them. That would have been the farthest thing from their mind,’’ end of quote. Sometimes, Judge, however, I fear that the Supreme Court forgets this advice. In the last 15 years, in fact, the Court has struck down, in whole or in part, more than 35 acts of this Congress, and nearly 60 State and local laws. Without question, the Court does play a vital role in our constitutional system. Sometimes local, State, and Federal law so clearly run afoul of the Constitution, that the Court must step in and strike them down. In most cases, the Court performs this admirably and with great restraint. In recent years, the Court has struck down some laws that, in my opinion, did not deserve such a fate. Take, for instance,

the Americans with Disabilities Act; it passed this Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. The law was supported by an extensive factual record, and it was based on our Government’s longstanding constitutional power to fight discrimination wherever it exists. When the Court considered the ADA in the Garrett case, however, it ignored the Act’s broad support, cast aside the legislative record, and struck down a portion of the law. The decision was a close one, 5–4. The majority relied on a highly controversial legal theory, and the case evoked a vigorous dissent.
This is precisely my problem with Garrett. In such a difficult case where the Constitution does not clearly support the majority’s decision, the proper response is not to strike down the law. In such a case, the Court should defer to the will of the people. In other ways, Judge, the Court’s recent decisions have made life more difficult for the democratic institutions that perform the day-to-day work of our Nation, recent cases involving affirmative action and the posting of the Ten Commandments on public property, which seem to me at least to prove the point. The Court has upheld one affirmative action program at the University of Michigan, but struck down another one, and has allowed the posting of the Ten Commandments outside of a public building, but banned it on the inside in another case.
To add to the confusion, some of the Court’s decisions involve multiple concurrences and dissents, making it hard, even for lawyers and judges to figure out what the law is and why.
Chief Justice Roberts mentioned this problem at his hearing. And in one of his final statements as Chief Justice, William Rehnquist noted that one of the Court’s decisions had so many opinions within it that he—and I quote—‘‘didn’t know we had so many Justices on the Court.’’
What has emerged in certain areas, therefore, is a patchwork, a patchwork that leaves local officials, State legislators, Members of Congress and the public guessing what the law permits and what it does not. In 1937, President Franklin Roosevelt reminded us that the Constitution is, and I quote, ‘‘a layman’s document, not a lawyer’s contract.’’ But that very document does little to serve people when Supreme Court decisions are written so that even high-price lawyers cannot figure them out.
I am not the first to raise these democratic concerns. Many have faulted the Court for its lack of clarity in certain cases and many have criticized its recent lack of deference to decisions made by State legislatures and Congress. In fact, some have even suggested that this recent trend has transformed our democracy from one founded on ‘‘we, the people,’’ to one ruled by ‘‘we, the Court.’’ To me, the criticism has some force. The Constitution empowers the people to resolve our days’ most contentious issues. When judges forget this basic truth, they do a disservice to our democracy and to our Constitution. Judges are not Members of Congress. They are not State legislators, Governors, nor Presidents. Their job is not to pass laws, implement regulations, nor to make policy. To use the words of Justice Byron White, words that I quoted at our last Supreme Court hearing: the role of the judge is simply to decide cases; to decide cases, nothing more.

Judge, from what I have seen so far, you do not need much reminding on this score. Your decisions are usually brief and to the point. You write with clarity and common sense, and in most cases you defer to the decisionmaking of those closest to the problem at hand. I do not expect to agree with every case that you decide, but your modest approach to judging seems to bode well for our democracy.
Over the next several days the members of this Committee will question you to find out what kind of Justice you will be. This hearing is really our opportunity to try to answer that question. Our constitutional system is founded on democracy, a world of people, not the unchecked rule of judges. If confirmed, it will be your job to faithfully interpret our Constitution and to defend our democracy case by case. I wish you well.
Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator DeWine. Senator Feinstein.
STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Judge Alito. I am one that believes your appointment to the Supreme Court is the pivotal appointment, and because you replace Sandra Day O’Connor and because she was the fifth vote on 148 cases, you well could be a very key and decisive vote. So during these hearings, I think it is fair for us to try to determine whether your legal reasoning is within the mainstream of American legal thought and whether you are going to follow the law regardless of your personal views about the law. Since you have provided personal and legal opinions in the past, I very much hope that you will be straightforward with us, share your thinking, and share your legal reasoning. I would like to use my time to discuss with you some of my concerns. I have very deep concern about the legacy of the Rehnquist Court and its efforts to restrict congressional authority to enact legislation by adopting a very narrow view of several provisions of the Constitution, including the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment. This trend, I believe, if continued, would restrict and could even prevent the Congress from addressing major environmental and social issues of the future. As I see it, certain of your decisions on the Third Circuit raise questions about whether you would continue to advance the Rehnquist Court’s limited view of congressional authority, and I hope to clear that up. Let me give you one example here, and that is the Rybar case. Your dissent argued that Congress lacked the authority to ban the possession and transfer of machine guns based essentially on a technicality. The congressional findings from previous statutes were not explicitly incorporated in the legislation. You took this position even though the Supreme Court had made clear in 1939, the Miller case, that Congress did have the authority to ban the possession and transfer of firearms, and even though Congress had passed three Federal statutes that extensively documented the impact that guns and gun violence have on interstate commerce. I am

27
concerned that your Rybar opinion demonstrates a willingness to strike down laws with which you personally may disagree by employing a narrow reading of Congress’s constitutional authority to enact legislation.
The subject of Executive power has come up, and indeed it is a very big one. I think we are all concerned about how you approach and decide cases involving expanded Presidential powers. Recently there have been several actions taken by the administration that highlight why the constitutional checks and balances between the branches of Government are so essential. These include the use of torture, whether through an expansive reading of law, or disregarding Geneva Conventions, including the Convention on Torture, whether the President is bound by ratified treaties or not, allowing the detention of American citizens without providing due process—of course, Sandra Day O’Connor was dispositive in the Hamdi case—and whether the President can conduct electronic surveillance on Americans without a warrant despite legislation that establishes a court process for all electronic surveillance.
I am also concerned with the impact you could have on women’s rights, and specifically, a woman’s right to choose. In the 33 years since Roe was decided, there have been 38 occasions on which Roe has been taken up by the Court. The Court has not only declined to overrule Roe, but it has also explicitly reaffirmed its central holding. In our private meeting, when we spoke about Roe and precedent, you stated that you could not think of a case that has been reviewed or challenged more than Roe. You also stated that you believe that the Constitution does provide a right of privacy and that you have a deep respect for precedent.
However, in 1985, you clearly stated that you believed Roe should be overturned and that the Constitution does not protect a woman’s right to choose. So despite voting to sustain Roe on the Third Circuit, your opinions also raise questions about how you might rule if not bound by precedent, and of course, obviously, I would like to find that out.
I am also concerned about the role the Court will play in protecting individual rights in this and the next century. Historically, the Court has been the forum to which individuals can turn when they believed their constitutional rights were violated. This has been especially noteworthy in the arena of civil rights, and as has been mentioned, in that same 1985 job application, you wrote that while in college you developed a deep interest in constitutional law, and then you said, motivated in part by disagreement with the Warren Court’s decisions, particularly in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment. Now, of course, it was the Warren Court that brought us Brown v. Board of Education, and of course, reapportionment is the bedrock principle of ‘‘one man, one vote.’’ So exactly what you mean by this I think is necessary to clear up.
Now, additionally, Justice O’Connor was a deciding vote on a critical affirmative action case involving the University of Michigan, Grutter v. Bollinger. So your views here may well be pivotal, so I think the American people deserve to know how you feel, how you think, how you would legally reason affirmative action legislation.

When you served in the Solicitor General’s Office during the Reagan administration, you argued in three cases against the constitutionality of affirmative action programs, then once on the Third Circuit, you sided against the individual alleging discrimination in about three-quarters of the cases before you.
We have a lot to learn about what your views are and your legal reasoning, and how you would apply that legal reasoning. I really look forward to the questions, and once again, because this appointment is so important, I hope you really will be straightforward with us, and thereby be really straightforward with the American people.
So thank you, and welcome. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Sessions.
STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF SESSIONS, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA
Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to also extend my congratulations to you, Judge Alito and your family. It is a very special day, a great honor to be nominated to the Supreme Court, the greatest court in the world, in my view, and this will be a good process. The Senate has an obligation to make a vigorous inquiry, and they will do so. I just hope and truly believe that by the end of these hearings your answers will be heard. The charges that I have heard made I know will be rebutted. People will listen and see the answers that you give, and when they do, they will feel great confidence in you as a member of the Supreme Court. You have a record as a brilliant but modest jurist, one who follows the law, who exercises restraint and does not use the bench as an opportunity to promote any personal or political agenda. This is exactly what I believe the American people want in a Justice to the Supreme Court. It is exactly what President Bush promised to nominate. You represent philosophically that kind of judge who shows restraint, but at the same time you bring extraordinary qualifications and abilities. As has been said, judges are not politicians. They must decide discrete cases before them based on the law and the facts of that case. They are not policymakers. Every lawyer that has practiced in America knows that. That is what they want in a judge. That is what I understand they believe you are. That is why the ABA has given you their top rating, in my view. This ideal of American law is the rule of law. It is the American ideal of justice, not to have an agenda, not to allow personal views to impact your decisionmaking, and I am real proud to see that your record indicates that. I like Judge Roberts’s phrase of ‘‘modesty.’’ I believe that is your philosophy also. We had the opportunity for a time to serve as United States Attorneys together. You were the top prosecutor in the office in New Jersey, one of the largest in the country. You had the whole State, much larger than my office. I know your reputation as one of ability, but modesty. In fact, I remember distinctly somebody told me, ‘‘Don’t underestimate Sam Alito. He’s a modest kind of guy, but he’s probably the smartest guy in the Department

of Justice.’’ I think that is the reputation you had and one that you can be quite proud of.
Your record of achievement is extraordinary. You were Phi Beta Kappa at Princeton and a Woodrow Wilson scholar. You attended Yale Law School. You were an editor of the law review, elected by your colleagues, and of course, for a graduating law student at a prestigious law school or any law school, being an editor of the law review is an extraordinary honor.
You clerked for a Federal judge on the Third Circuit. You were an Assistant United States Attorney. You did appellate work, handling criminal cases, and as United States Attorney you were primarily a prosecutor. As I have checked the record, you will be the first person to serve on the Supreme Court since Tom Clark, who was appointed by Harry Truman in 1949, that had actual Federal prosecutorial experience, which I think is a great value. Matter of fact, I know it is a value. I have seen instances of Supreme Court rulings where errors have been made, mostly as a result of just not understanding the system and how it operates.
As an Assistant Solicitor General you argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court. That is an extraordinary number. Very, very few people in our country have had the opportunity to do that. Very few lawyers will ever in their career do one case much less 12.
So you did a great job, and I think that is why the ABA, the American Bar Association has rendered their views on you. It is a 15-member committee. All of them participate on a Supreme Court nominee. They take this very seriously. They interview judges with whom you work. They interview your colleagues. They interview people who litigated against you. They interview litigants who have lost before you as well as those who won before you, your co-counsel. And at the conclusion of all of that, they unanimously gave you their highest possible rating. I think that is an important thing. Some of us on our side of the aisle criticize the ABA. We say they tilt a little to the left, but their analysis process and the way they go about it provides valuable insight to this Committee and to the people of America, that the people of the country can know that they have interviewed a host of people who have dealt with you in every single area of your life, and they found you highly qualified, the best recommendation they can give, and that is something you should take great pride in.
We do not want an activist judge. That is not what we want in this country. By ‘‘activist’’ I mean a judge who allows his personal views to overcome a commitment to faithfully following the law, following the law as it is, not as you would like it to be, good or bad, following that law. That is what we count on. When we violate that, we undermine law, we undermine respect for law, and endanger this magnificent heritage of law that we have been given. From what I understand your approach to law, you have it right, and your record indicates that.
The judicial oath you take is important. Some might say you have to follow precedent and precedent is a very big part of what you do, but you take the oath to swear that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. You will take that oath if confirmed, and you have already taken it as a Third Circuit Judge. It is an oath not to decide whether a decision is good policy
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00041 Fmt 6633 Sfmt 6633 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.000 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

30
or not. That is for the legislative branch. It is not an oath to defend the wall that the Supreme Court has enclosed sometimes around itself. It is not an oath to avoid admitting error in previous decision. But let me be more direct. The oath you take is not an oath to uphold precedent whether that precedent is super duper or not. If you love the Constitution, which I hope you do, and I intend to inquire about that, you will enforce the Constitution as it is, good and bad. That is your responsibility in our democracy.
We have already had this morning some matters that have been raised, and I think are worthy of just responding to briefly because allegations get made in these hearings, you may never get a chance by the time this hearing is over to rebut some of the things that have already been raised. Senator Kennedy claimed that you have not offered an opinion or a dissent siding with a claim of racial discrimination. I would point him to U.S. v. Kithcart. There you made it clear that the Constitution does not allow police officers to racially profile black drivers. A police officer received a report that two black males in a black sports car had committed three robberies. Later they pulled over a driver because he was a black man in a black sports car. You wrote that this violated the Fourth Amendment. You stated that the mere fact that Kithcart was black and the perpetrators had been described as two black males was plainly insufficient.
They also may want to look at your majority opinion in Brinson v. Vaughn, where you rule that the Constitution does not allow prosecutors to exclude African-Americans from jurors, and you granted the petitioner’s habeas petition in that case, reversing the conviction. You stated the Constitution guarantees, ‘‘that a State does not use peremptory challenges of jurors to remove any black jurors because of his race, thus a prosecutor’s decision to refrain from discriminating against some African-American voters does not cure discrimination against others.’’
As for dissents, you were the lone dissenter calling for an expansive interpretation of civil rights laws. Your dissent complained in an employer case that the majority had substituted its own opinion for the law, and you dissented, and later the Supreme Court vindicated you, 9–0.
I would also note you were questioned about judicial independence. I think some of our people have mentioned that, but an academic study of Federal Appeals Court opinions rated you the fourth most independent judge in the Federal judiciary. That is out of 98. They took that based on issues such as whether or not you are most likely to disagree with judges or agree with judges of a different political party.
Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your leadership, and look forward to a vigorous hearing. I am confident this nominee has the skills and graces to make an outstanding Supreme Court Justice.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. We are going to turn to one more Senator, Senator Feingold, for an opening statement, and then we are going to take a 15-minute break. We will have concluded the opening statements of 12 of our 18 Judiciary Committee members. That will leave us four more.

STATEMENT OF SENATOR RUSSELL D. FEINGOLD, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN
Senator FEINGOLD. Mr. Chairman, I too want to welcome our nominee and thank him in advance for the long hours that he will put in this week.
Judge, I do greatly admire your legal qualifications, and of course, your record of public service, and I wish you well here. And as with the hearing and the nomination of Chief Justice Roberts, I approach this proceeding with an open mind.
Judge Alito, I know that as a long-time student of the law in the Supreme Court, you appreciate the importance of the process that we begin today. A position on the Supreme Court is one of the highest honors and greatest responsibilities in our country. The Constitution requires the Senate to offer its advice and decide whether to grant its consent to your nomination, and the Senate has duly delegated to the Judiciary Committee the task of examining your record and hearing your testimony and responses to questions about your views.
So it is our job in these hearings to try to get a sense for ourselves, for our colleagues who are not on the Committee, and for the American people, of whether you should be given the enormous responsibility of protecting our citizens’ constitutional freedoms on the Supreme Court. So you will, obviously, face tough questions here, Judge.
No one is entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court simply because he has been nominated by the President. I think the burden is actually on the nominee to demonstrate that he should be confirmed.
We begin these hearings today at an important time. Less than a month ago we learned that this administration has for years been spying on American citizens without a court order and without following the laws passed by Congress. Americans are understandably asking each other whether our Government believes it is subject to the rule of law. Now more than ever we need a strong and independent judicial branch. We need judges who will stand up and tell the executive branch it is wrong when it ignores or distorts the laws passed by Congress. We need judges who see themselves as custodians of the rights and freedoms that the Constitution guarantees even when the President of the United States is telling the country that he should be able to decide unilaterally, unilaterally, how far these freedoms go.
To win my support, Judge Alito will have to show that he is up to the challenge. His instincts sometimes seem to be to defer to the executive branch to minimize the ability of the courts to question

the Executive in national security cases, to grant prosecutors whatever powers they seek, and to deny relief to those accused of crimes who assert that their constitutional rights were violated. So it will be up to Judge Alito to satisfy the Senate that he can be fair and objective in these kind of cases.
We need judges on the bench who will ensure that the judicial branch of Government is the independent check on Executive power that the Constitution requires and that the American people expect.
In these days of corruption investigations and indictments in Washington, we also need judges who are beyond ethical reproach. In 1990, when the judge appeared before this Committee in connection with this nomination to the Court of Appeals, Judge Alito promised to recuse himself from cases involving a mutual fund company with which he had substantial investments, Vanguard. He kept those investments throughout his service on the Court of Appeals and still has them today. But in 2002 he sat on a panel in a case involving Vanguard. Since his nomination to the Supreme Court, we have now heard different explanations from the nominee and his supporters about why he failed to recuse himself. Needless to say, the shifting explanations and justifications are somewhat troubling. I hope that we will get the full and final story in these hearings.
Before we grant lifetime tenure to Federal judges, and particularly Justices of the Supreme Court, we must make sure that they have the highest ethical standards. The stakes for this nomination could hardly be higher. Justice O’Connor, as many have said, was the swing vote in many important decisions in the past decade. Her successor could well be the deciding vote in a number of cases that have already been argued this term, that may have to be reargued after a new Justice is confirmed. The outcome of these cases could shape our society for generations to come.
Now, we do not have the right to know how a nominee would rule on those cases. Indeed, we should all hope that the nominee does not know either, but we do have a right to know what and how a nominee thinks about the important legal issues that have come to the Court in recent years. Commenting on past Supreme Court decisions, in my view, would no more disqualify a nominee from hearing a future case on a similar topic than would a current Justice participating in those past decisions. Mr. Chairman, it simply cannot be that the only person in America who cannot express an opinion on a case where Justice O’Connor cast the deciding vote, is the person who has been nominated to replace her on the Court.
So I look forward to questioning you, Judge Alito, about Executive power, the death penalty, employment discrimination, criminal procedure and other important topics, and I look forward to your candid answers. I will have to say that I was rather pleased that the judge was actually less guarded in our private meeting, than were the other two Supreme Court nominees who I had had the privilege to meet. I hope he is even more forthcoming in this hearing.
Given his long judicial record and the memos we have seen that express his personal views on legal issues, I expect complete answers, and I think my colleagues do too. If a nominee expresses a

personal view on a legal issue in a memo written over a decade ago, I think we and the American people have the right to know if he still holds that view today.
Mr. Chairman, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Alito is likely to have a profound impact on the lives of Americans for decades to come. That is a fact. It is clear, Mr. Chairman, from how you have planned these hearings, that you recognize that.
Thank you for your efforts to ensure a full and fair evaluation of this nominee, and I not only look forward to the questioning, but I want to note that I have caused the recess to occur 3 minutes and 40 seconds earlier than it normally would have.
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feingold, for your brevity. We will now take a 15-minute recess until 2:15. [Recess from 2 p.m. to 2:15 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. It is 2:15. We will resume these hearings. Next up on opening statement is Senator Graham. Senator GRAHAM. Shall I wait or go ahead, Mr. Chairman? [Pause.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Graham, you may begin.
STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back, Judge. I would hate for you to miss my opening statement, a loss for the ages.
Welcome to the Committee. Welcome to one of the most important events in your life. You have got the people that mean the most here with you today, your family, and I know they are proud of you, and I am certainly proud of what you have been able to accomplish.
To say the least, you come to the Senate in interesting political times. There is going to be a lot of talk by the Senators of this Committee about concepts that are important to Americans, but what I worry the most about is your time, believe it or not, will come and go. You will not be here forever. It may seem that way, but I think you are going to be just fine.
I don’t know what kind of vote you are going to get, but you will make it through. It is possible you could talk me out of voting for you, but I doubt it. So I won’t even try to challenge you along those lines. I feel very comfortable with you being on the Supreme Court based on what I know, and the hearings will be helpful to all of us to find out some issues that are important to us.
We had a talk recently about Executive power. That is very important to me. In time of war, I want the executive branch to have the tools to protect me, my family and my country. But also I believe even during a time of war, the rule of law applies.
I have got some problems with using a force resolution to the point that future Presidents may not be able to get a force resolution from Congress if you interpret it too broadly. And we will talk about those things and we will talk more about it.
I am going to talk a little bit about some of the points my colleagues have been making. Everybody knows you are a conserv-

ative. The question is are you a mainstream conservative. Well, the question I have for my colleagues is who would you ask to find out. Would you ask Senator Kennedy? Probably not. If you asked me who a mainstream liberal is, I would be your worst person to pick because I don’t hang out over there.
I suspect that most all of us, if not all of us, will vote for you, and I would argue that we represent from the center line to the right ditch in our party and if all of us vote for you, you have got to be pretty mainstream. So the answer to the question, are you a mainstream conservative, will soon be know.
If every Republican member of the Judiciary Committee votes for you and you are not mainstream, that means we are not mainstream. And it is a word that means what you want it to mean. Advise and consent means what? Whatever you want it to mean. Advise and consent means the process has got to work to the advantage of people I like, and with people I don’t want on the Court, it is a different process. That is politics.
Every Senator will have to live within themselves as to what they would like to see happen for the judiciary. My main concern here is not about you. It is about us. What are we going to be doing as a body to the judiciary when it is all said and done?
Roe v. Wade and abortion. If I wanted to work for Ronald Reagan, one of the things I would tell the Reagan administration is I think Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided. They are likely to hire me because they were trying to prove to the Court that the Court took away from elected officials a very important right, protecting the unborn.
I was on a news program with Senator Feinstein this weekend, who is a terrific person. She made a very emotional, compelling argument that she can remember back-alley abortions and women committing suicide when abortion was illegal. I understand that is very seared in her memory banks and that is important to her.
Well, let me tell you there is another side to that story. There are millions of Americans, a bunch of them in South Carolina, who are heartsick that millions of unborn children have been sent to certain death because of what judges have done. It is a two-sided argument. It is an emotional event in our society.
They are talking about filibustering maybe if you don’t give the right answer. Well, what could possibly be the right answer about Roe v. Wade? If you acknowledge it is a precedent of the Court, well, then you would be right. If you refuse to listen to someone who is trying to change the way it is applied or to overturn it and you will say here I will never listen to them, you might talk me out of voting for you. I don’t think any American should lose the right to challenge any precedent that the Supreme Court has issued because the judge wanted to get on the Court.
And you may be a great fan of Roe v. Wade and you think it should be there forever. There may be a case where someone disagrees with that line of reasoning. What I want from the judge is the understanding that precedent matters, but the facts, the brief and the law is what you are going to base your decision on as to whether or not that precedent stands, not some bargain to get on the Court, because I can tell you if that ever becomes a reason to filibuster, there are plenty of people that I personally know, if it

became fashionable to stand on the floor of the Senate to stop a nominee on the issue of abortion, who feel so deeply, so honestly held belief that an abortion is certain death for an unborn child that they would stand on their feet forever.
And is that what we want? Is that where we are going as a Nation? Are we going to take one case and one issue and if we don’t get the answer we like that represents our political view on that issue, are we going to bring the judiciary to their knees? Are we going to say as a body it doesn’t matter how smart you are, how many cases you have decided, how many things you have done in your life as a lawyer, forget about it, it all comes down to this one issue?
If we do, if we go down that road, there will be no going back, and good men and women will be deterred from coming before this body to serve their Nation as a judge at the highest levels. What we are saying and what we are doing here is far more important than just whether or not Judge Alito gets through the process.
What is the proper role of a Senator when it comes to advising and consenting? I would argue that if we start taking the one or two cases we cherish the most and make that a litmus test, we have let our country down and we have changed the historical standard.
Elections matter. Values debates occur all over this country. They occur in Presidential elections. It is no mystery as to what President Bush would do if he won. He would pick people like John Roberts and Sam Alito. That is what he said he would do. That is exactly what he has done. He has picked solid strict constructionists, conservatives, who have long, distinguished legal careers.
What did President Clinton do? He picked people left of the center who worked for Democrats. And it cannot surprise the people on the other side that the two people we picked worked for Ronald Reagan. We liked Ronald Reagan. President Clinton picked Ginsburg and Breyer. Justice Ginsburg was the general counsel for the ACLU. If I am going to base my decision based on who you represented as a lawyer, how in the world could I ever vote for somebody that represented the ACLU?
If I am going to make my decision based on whether or not I agree with the Princeton faculty and administration policies on ROTC students and quotas and I am bound by that, I will get killed at home. What Princeton does with their admission policies and whether or not a ROTC unit should be on a campus is an OK thing to debate; at least I hope it is OK. I think most Americans are going to be with the group that you are associated with, not the policies of Princeton.
The bottom line is you come here as an individual with a life well lived. Everybody who seems to have worked with you as a private lawyer, public lawyer and as a judge admires you, even though they may disagree with you.
My biggest concern, members of this Committee, is if we don’t watch the way we treat people like Judge Alito, we are going to drive good men and women away from wanting to serve. There will be a Democratic President one day. I don’t know when, but that is likely to happen, and there will be another Justice Ginsburg come

over. If she came over in this atmosphere, she wouldn’t get 96 votes. Judge Scalia wouldn’t get 98 votes, and that is sad to me.
I hope we will use this opportunity not only to treat you fairly, but not use a double standard. I hope we will understand that this is bigger than you, this is bigger than us, and the way we conduct ourselves and what we expect of you we had better be willing to expect when we are not in power.
Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Graham. Senator Schumer.
STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK
Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, welcome to you, Mrs. Alito, your two children, the rest of your family. I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your nomination. If confirmed, you will be one of nine people who collectively hold power over everyone who lives in this country. You will define our freedom, you will affect our security, and you will shape our law. You will determine on some days where we pray and how we vote. You will define on other days when life begins and what our schools may teach, and you will decide from time to time who shall live and who shall die. These decisions are final and appeals impossible. That is the awesome responsibility and power of a Supreme Court Justice, and it is therefore only appropriate that everyone who aspires to that office bear a heavy burden when they come before the Senate and the American people to prove that they are worthy. But while every Supreme Court nominee has a great burden, yours, Judge Alito, is triply high, first because you have been named to replace Sandra Day O’Connor, the pivotal swing vote on a divided Court; second, because you seem to have been picked to placate the extreme right wing after the hasty withdrawal of Harriet Miers; and finally, and most importantly, because your record of opinions and statements on a number of critical constitutional questions seems quite extreme. So, first, as this Committee takes up your nomination, we can’t forget recent history, because that history increases your burden and explains why the American people want us to examine every portion of your record with great care. Harriet Miers’s nomination was blocked by a cadre of conservative critics who undermined her at every turn. She didn’t get to explain her judicial philosophy, she didn’t get to testify at the hearing, and she did not get the up-or-down vote on the Senate floor that her critics are now demanding that you receive. Why? For the simple reason that those critics couldn’t be sure that her judicial philosophy squared with their extreme political agenda. They seem to be very sure of you. The same critics who called the President on the carpet for naming Harriet Miers have rolled out the red carpet for you, Judge Alito. We would be remiss if we didn’t explore why. And there is an additional significance to the Miers precedent which is this: everyone now seems to agree that nominees should

explain their judicial philosophy and ideology. After so many of my friends across the aisle spoke so loudly about the obligation of nominees to testify candidly about their legal views and their judicial philosophy when the nominee was Harriet Miers, I hope we will not see a flip-flop now that the nominee is Sam Alito.
The second reason your burden is higher, of course, is that you are filling the shoes of Sandra Day O’Connor. Those are big shoes to be sure, but hers are also special shoes. She was the first woman in the history of the Supreme Court, is the only sitting Justice with experience as a legislator, and has been the most frequent swing vote in a quarter century of service.
While Sandra Day O’Connor has been at the fulcrum of the Court, you appear poised to add weight to one side. That alone is not necessarily cause for alarm or surprise, but is certainly a reason for pause. Are you in Justice O’Connor’s mold or, as the President has vowed, are you in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas?
Most importantly, though, your burden is high because of your record. Although I haven’t made up my mind, I have serious concerns about that record. There are reasons to be troubled. You are the most prolific dissenter in the Third Circuit.
This morning, President Bush said Judge Alito has the intellect and judicial temperament to be on the Court. But the President left out the most important qualification: a nominee’s judicial philosophy.
Judge Alito, in case after case, you give the impression of applying careful legal reasoning, but too many times you happen to reach the most conservative result. Judge Alito, you give the impression of being a meticulous legal navigator, but in the end you always seem to chart a right-ward course.
Some wrongly suggest that we are being results-oriented when we question the results you have reached. But the opposite is true. We are trying to make sure you are capable of being fair, no matter the identity of the party before you. Sometimes, you give the government a free pass, but refuse to give plaintiffs a fair shake. We need to know that Presidents and paupers will receive equal justice in your courtroom.
If the record showed that an umpire repeatedly called 95 percent of pitches strikes when one team’s players were up and repeatedly called 95 percent of pitches balls when the other team’s players were up, one would naturally ask whether the umpire was being impartial and fair.
In many areas, we will expect clear and straightforward answers because you have a record on these issues; for example, Executive power, congressional power and personal autonomy, just to name a few. The President is not a king, free to take any action he chooses without limitation by law.
The Court is not a legislature, free to substitute its own judgment for that of elected bodies, and the people are not subjects, powerless to control their own most intimate decisions. Will your judicial philosophy preserve these principles or will it erode them?
In each of these areas, there is cause for concern. In the area of Executive power, Judge Alito, you have embraced and endorsed the

38
theory of the unitary Executive. Your deferential and absolutist view of separation of powers raises questions.
Under this view, in times of war the President would, for instance, seem to have inherent authority to wiretap American citizens without a warrant, to ignore congressional Acts at will, or to take any other action he saw fit under his inherent powers. We need to know, when a President goes to far, will you be a check on his power or will you issue him a blank check to exercise whatever power alone he thinks appropriate. Right now, that is an open question, given your stated views.
Similarly on the issue of federalism, you seem to have taken an extreme view, substituting your own judgment for that of a legislature. Certainly, one important case you wrote, in Rybar v. U.S., that Congress exceeded its power by prohibiting the possession of fully automatic machine guns. Do you still hold these cramped views of congressional power? Will you engage in judicial activism to find ways to strike down laws that the American people want their elected representatives to pass and that the Constitution authorizes?
And, of course, you have made statements expressing your view that the, quote, ‘‘Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion,’’ unquote. In fact, you said in 1985 that you personally believe very strongly this is true. You also spoke while in the Justice Department of, quote, ‘‘the opportunity to advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade.’’
It should not be surprising that these statements will bring a searching inquiry, as many of my colleagues have already suggested. So we will ask you, do you still personally believe very strongly that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion? We will ask, do you view elevation to the Supreme Court, where you will no longer be bound by High Court precedent, as the long-sought opportunity to advance the goals of bringing about the eventual overruling of Roe v. Wade, as you stated in 1985?
Judge Alito, I sincerely hope you will answer our questions. Most of the familiar arguments for ducking direct questions no longer apply and certainly don’t apply in your case. For example, the logic of the mantra repeated by John Roberts at his hearing that one could not speak on a subject because the issue was likely to come before him quickly vanishes when the nominee has a written record, as you do, on so many subjects.
Even under the so-called Ginsburg precedent, which was endorsed by Judge Roberts, Republican Senators and the White House, you have an obligation to answer questions on topics that you have written about. On the issue of choice, for example, because you have already made blanket statements about your view of the Constitution and your support for overruling Roe, you have already given the suggestion of pre-judgment on a question that will likely come before the Court. So I respectfully submit you cannot use that as a basis for not answering.
So I hope, Judge Alito, that when we ask you about prior statements you have made about the law, some strong, some even strident, you will simply not answer, in effect, no comment. That will not dismiss prior expressions of decidedly legal opinions as merely

personal beliefs, and that will enhance neither your credibility nor your reputation for careful legal reasoning.
I look forward, Judge, to a full and fair hearing. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Schumer. Senator Cornyn.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN CORNYN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS
Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, welcome to the Committee, and to your family as well. I am a little surprised to learn that you have a triply high burden for confirmation here. I guess we will get a chance to explore that and the fairness of that, or whether all nominees ought to have the same burden before the Committee. What I want to also make sure of is that we don’t hold you to a double standard, that we don’t expect of you answers to questions that Justice Ginsburg and others declined to answer in the interests of the independence of the judiciary and in the interests of observing the canons of judicial ethics. Nevertheless, we have already heard a great deal about you and your credentials for the Supreme Court. As has been noted, you served with distinction on the court of appeals. You have served as a United States Attorney, and indeed you have served your entire adult life in public service. We have also heard a bit today—and we will hear more as these proceedings unfold—about the testimonials from people who have worked with you, people who know you best, whether liberal, moderate or conservative. The judges on your court have praised you as a thoughtful and open-minded jurist, and we will hear more from them later in the week. The same can be said of the dozens of law clerks who have worked with you over the last 15 years. As you know, law clerks are those who advise appellate judges on the cases they hear, and you have had law clerks from all political persuasions, from members of the Green Party, to Democrat clerks, even a clerk that went on to serve as counsel of record for John Kerry’s campaign for President. And every single one of them says that you will make a terrific Supreme Court Justice, that you apply the law in a fair and even-handed manner, and that you bring no agenda to your job as a judge. If fairness, integrity, qualifications and an open mind were all that mattered in this process, you would be confirmed unanimously. But we know that is not how the process works, or at least how it works today. We know that 22 Senators, including 5 on this committee, voted against Chief Justice Roberts’s confirmation just a few short months ago. And my suspicion is that you do not come here with a total level playing field. I am reluctantly inclined to the view that you and other nominees of this President to the Supreme Court start with no more than 13 votes on this Committee and only 78 votes in the full Senate, with a solid, immovable, and unpersuadable block of at least 22 votes against you, no matter what you say and no matter what you do. Now, that is unfortunate for you, but it is even worse for

the Senate and its reputation as the world’s greatest deliberative body.
The question is why—with so many people from both sides of the aisle and across the ideological spectrum supporting your nomination—are liberal special interest groups and their allies devoting so much time and so much money to defeat your nomination? The answer, I am afraid, is that there are a number of groups who really don’t want a fair-minded judge who has an openness to both sides of the argument. Rather, they want judges who will impose their liberal agenda on the American people—views so liberal that they cannot prevail at the ballot box.
So they want judges who will find traditional marriage limited to one man and one woman unconstitutional. They want judges who will ban any trace of religious expression from the public square. They even want judges who will prohibit schoolchildren from reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. As I say, none of these are mainstream positions embraced by the American people. So the strategy is to try to impose their agenda through unelected judges.
Judge Alito, the reason why these groups are trying to defeat your nomination—because you won’t support their liberal agenda— is precisely why I support it. I want judges on the Supreme Court who will not use their position to impose personal policy preferences or a political agenda on the American people. I want judges on the Supreme Court who will respect the words and the meaning of the Constitution, the laws enacted by Congress, and the laws enacted by State legislatures.
Now, this doesn’t mean, as you know, that a judge will always reach what might be called a conservative result. It means that judges will reach whatever result is directed by the Constitution, by the law, and by the facts of a case. Sometimes it might be called conservative, sometimes it might be called liberal. But the point is that the meaning of the Constitution and other laws should not change unless we the people change them.
A Supreme Court appointment is not a roving commission to rewrite our laws however you and your colleagues see fit. I will give you one example of an area where I believe our Supreme Court has been rewriting the Constitution for a long time. It is an area near and dear to me and others in this country. I am speaking of the ability of people of faith to freely express their beliefs in the public square.
There is no doubt where the Founding Fathers stood on this issue. They believed that people of faith should be permitted to express themselves in public. They believed that this country was big enough and free enough to allow expression of an enormous variety of views and beliefs. They believed that freedom of expression included religious views and beliefs, so long as the government did not force people to worship in a particular manner and remained neutral on what those views and beliefs were.
But this country has gotten seriously off track under the Supreme Court when it went so far as to limit the right of even private citizens to freely express their religious views in public. As I mentioned to you when we met early on in these proceedings, I had an opportunity, as some have had on this Committee, to argue a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. When I was attorney general,

I helped argue a case called Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe.
The school district in that case had the temerity to permit student-led, student-initiated prayer before football games. And, of course, someone sued. I repeat, this is student-led, student-initiated, voluntary prayer. The Supreme Court held by a vote of six to three that even this was unconstitutional.
The decision led the late Chief Justice Rehnquist to remark that the Court now exhibits ‘‘hostility to all things religious in public life.’’ It is hard to disagree with him. Depictions or expressions of sex, violence, crime are all permitted virtually without limit, but religion, it seems, never.
Now, this is where you come in, Judge Alito. I appreciate your record on the Third Circuit respecting the importance of neutrality of government when it comes to religious expression on a voluntary basis by individual citizens. It is my sincere hope that, when confirmed, you will persuade your colleagues to reconsider their attitude toward religious expression and grant it the same freedom currently reserved for almost all other non-religious speech.
No wonder many in America seem to believe that the Supreme Court has become one more inclined to protect pornography than to protect religious expression. Most people in America don’t believe that ‘‘God’’ is a dirty word. But the sad fact is that some Americans are left to wonder whether the Supreme Court might have greater regard for it if it were.
Again, welcome to the Committee and thank you for your continued willingness to serve our great Nation.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. Senator Durbin?
STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, welcome to you and your family before the Judiciary Committee. You have heard time and again from my colleagues why this seat on the Supreme Court means so much. They have quoted the statistics of 193 5–4 decisions where Sandra Day O’Connor was the deciding vote in 148 of those instances. She was a critical vote in issues of civil rights, human rights, workers’ rights, women’s rights, restraining the power of an overreaching President.
If you look at the record, the enviable record which Sandra Day O’Connor has written, you find she was the fifth and decisive vote to safeguard Americans’ right to privacy, to require courtrooms to grant access to the disabled, to allow the Federal Government to pass laws to protect the environment, to preserve the right of universities to use affirmative action, to ban the execution of children in America. And Justice O’Connor was the fifth vote to uphold the time-honored principle, which bears repeating, of separation of church and state. There was real wisdom in the decision of our forefathers in writing a Constitution that gave us an opportunity to grow as such a diverse Nation, and we should never forget it.
Justice O’Connor has been the critical decisive vote on many issues that go to the heart of who we are as a Nation. We believe, many of us, that the decision on filling this vacancy is going to tip

the scales of justice on the Supreme Court one way or the other, and that is why we are so mindful of the importance of our task.
Yesterday, the Chicago Tribune editorialized that anyone who questions your nomination has a heavy burden of proof. I disagree. I believe the burden of proof is yours, Judge Alito, the burden of demonstrating to the American people and this Committee that you or any nominee is worthy to serve on the highest Court, to succeed Sandra Day O’Connor.
My friend Illinois Senator Paul Simon once said as a member of this same Committee that the test for a Supreme Court nominee is not where he stands on any given issue. The test is this: Will you use your power on the Court to restrict freedom or expand it? In the simplest terms, I think Paul Simon got it right. That is the best test because the Supreme Court is the last refuge in America for our rights and liberties. In my lifetime, it is the Supreme Court, not Congress, that integrated public schools, that allowed people of different races to marry, and established the principle that our Government should respect the value of privacy of American families. These decisions are the legacy of Justices who chose to expand American freedom. If you are confirmed, Judge Alito, will you continue their legacy?
You and I spoke about the Griswold decision in my office. It is hard to imagine that 40 years ago people could be convicted of a crime, fined, and sent to prison for using the most common forms of birth control. The Supreme Court looked at that decision and said that is just wrong. We may not find the word ‘‘privacy’’ in the Constitution, but that is just inherent to our freedom as Americans. It seems like a given now. Who would even question it? But it has not been that long ago that up here on Capitol Hill we were involved in a bitter debate over the tragedy of Terri Schiavo. And Republican congressional leaders threatened Federal judges with impeachment if they did not agree to intervene into that family’s painful personal decision. We see it in attempts on Capitol Hill to impose gag rules on doctors on what they can say to their patients about family planning. And we certainly see it now with an effort by this Government to tap our phones, invade our medical records, credit information, library records, and the most sensitive personal information in the name of national security.
Now, Justice O’Connor was the critical fifth vote to protect our right of privacy. We want to know whether you will be that vote as well. You were the only judge on your court to authorize a very intrusive search of a 10-year-old girl. You were the only judge on your court who voted to diminish the right of privacy in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a position that was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court. And as a Government lawyer, you wrote that you personally believed very strongly the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion.
Like many, I have thought about this issue of abortion time and again. It is not an easy issue for most people. I have thought about the law and the impact of my personal religious beliefs and feelings. I have thought about the real lives of people and the tragic experiences of the women that I have met. And I have come to believe over the years that a woman should be able to make this agonizing decision with her doctor and her family and her conscience

and that we should be very careful that we don’t make that decision a crime except in the most extreme circumstances.
There is also the issue of personal privacy when it comes to the Executive power. Throughout our Nation’s history, during times of war, whether it was habeas corpus in the Civil War, the Alien and Sedition Acts in World War I, or Japanese internment camps in World War II, Presidents have gone too far. And in going too far, they have taken away the individual rights of American citizens. The last stop to protect those rights and liberties is the Supreme Court. That is why we want to make certain that when it comes to the checks and balances of the Constitution, you will stand with our Founding Fathers in protecting us from a Government or a President determined to seize too much power in the name of national security.
As a Government lawyer, you pushed a policy of legislative construction designed to make congressional intent secondary to Presidential intent. You wrote, and I quote, ‘‘The President will get the last word on questions of interpretation.’’ In speeches to the Federalist Society, you have identified yourself as a strong proponent of the so-called unitary Executive theory. That is a marginal theory at best, and yet it is one that you have said you believe in.
This is not an abstract debate. The Bush administration has repeatedly cited this theory to justify its most controversial policies in the war on terrorism. Under this theory, the Bush administration has claimed the right to seize American citizens in the United States and imprison them indefinitely without charge. They have claimed the right to engage in torture, even though American law makes torture a crime. Less than 2 weeks ago, the White House claimed the right to set aside the McCain torture amendment that passed the Senate 90–9. What was the rationale? The unitary Executive theory, which you have supported.
In the Hamdi case, Justice O’Connor wrote for the plurality, and it has been quoted many times: ‘‘A state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens.’’ If you are confirmed, Judge Alito, who will inspire your thinking if this President or any President threatens our fundamental constitutional rights? Will it be the Federalist Society or will it be Sandra Day O’Connor?
Two months ago, Rosa Parks was laid to rest. Her body laid in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a fitting tribute to the mother of our modern civil rights movement. Her courage is well known. The courage of Federal Judge Frank Johnson, whom we talked about, is well known as well. He was the one who gave the legal authority for the right to march from Selma to Montgomery, and he suffered dearly for it. He was ostracized and rejected. His life was threatened as a result of it.
When we met in my office, Judge Alito, you told me about how your father as a college student was almost expelled for standing up to the college president who decided that the school basketball team should not use its African-American players against an allwhite opponent. That university president did not want to offend their all-white opponent, but your dad stood up, and you were so proud of that moment in your family history. I admire your father’s courage as well. But just as we do not hold the son responsible for

the sins of the father, neither can we credit the son for the courage of the father. As Supreme Court Justice, would you have the courage to stand up for civil rights even if it is unpopular?
We want to understand what you meant in 1985 when you said from the heart that you disagreed with the Warren Court on reapportionment, the one man/one vote principle. That was a civil rights decision. We want you to explain your membership in an organization that you highlighted at Princeton University that tried to challenge the admission of women and minorities. And I think we want to make certain of one thing. We want to make certain that every American who stood in silent tribute to Rosa Parks hopes that you will break your silence and speak out clearly for the civil rights that define our unity as a Nation.
There have been many controversial cases alluded to here. Some people have questioned, What is the difference? What difference in my life does it make if Sam Alito is on the bench or if he isn’t? Why would I care if it is a narrow interpretation or a broad interpretation of the law? How does it affect my life? We know it affects everyone’s life. We were reminded just very recently with the tragedy that was in the headlines. In one of your dissents, you would have allowed a Pennsylvania coal mine to escape worker safety and health requirements required by Federal law. Last week’s tragedy at the Sago mine reminds us that such a decision could have life and death consequences.
Judge Alito, millions of Americans are concerned about your nomination. They are worried that you would be a judicial activist who would restrict our rights and freedoms. During your hearing, you will have a chance to respond, and I hope you do. More than any recent nominee, your speeches, your writings, your judicial opinions make it clear that you have the burden to prove to the American people that you would not come to the Supreme Court with any political agenda. Clear and candid answers are all that we ask.
I sincerely hope you can convince the U.S. Senate and the American people that you will be a fifth vote on the Supreme Court that the American people can trust to protect our most basic important freedoms and preserve our time-honored values.
Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Durbin. Senator Brownback?
STATEMENT OF HON. SAM BROWNBACK, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS
Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Judge Alito, your wife and family. Delighted to have you here. You only have two more pitchers, and then you get a bat. So I am sure people will be happy to hear from you. Mr. Chairman, before I go forward with my statement, I would like to enter into the record a summary of four cases that Judge Alito has ruled on where he backed employees claiming racial discrimination. It has been entered a couple of times here that he has not ruled in favor of people claiming racial discrimination, and I have a summary of four cases where he has, and I want to enter that into the record.

Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.
Senator BROWNBACK. Judge Alito, I welcome you to the hearing. This is an extraordinary process. It is a fabulous process and a chance for a discussion with you, with the American public, about the role of the judiciary in our society today. It has become an everexpanding and important discussion because of the expanding role of the courts in recent years in American society. When the courts, improperly, I believe, assume the power to decide more political than legal issues in nature, the people naturally focus less on the law and more on the lawyers that are chosen really to administer the law. Most Americans want judges who will stick to interpreting the law rather than making it. It is beyond dispute that the Constitution and its Framers intended this to be the role of judges.
For instance, although he was perhaps the leading advocate for expansive Federal power, you can look at Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, nevertheless assuring—assuring—the countrymen in Federalist 78 that the role of the Federal courts under the proposed Constitution would be limited. He said, ‘‘The courts must declare the sense of the law, and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequences would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body.’’
It seems like we are back at an old debate—the role of the courts—and I believe you and others would look and say that the role of the courts is limited, and it is not to decide political matters.
Chief Justice Marshall later explained in Marbury v. Madison that the Constitution permitted Federal courts neither to write nor execute the laws but, rather, to say what the law is. That narrow scope of judicial power was the reason the people accepted the idea that the Federal courts could have the power of judicial review. That is the ability to decide whether a challenged law comports with the Constitution.
The people believed that while the courts would be independent, they would defer to the political branches on policy issues. This is the most foundational and fundamental of issues. And yet we are back in discussing it because of the role of the judiciary expanding in this society today.
It may seem ironic, but the judicial branch preserves its legitimacy through refraining from action on political questions. That concept was put forward best by Justice Frankfurter, appointed by President Roosevelt. He said, ‘‘Courts are not representative bodies. They are not designed to be a good reflex of a democratic society. Their judgment is best informed and, therefore, most dependable within narrow limits.’’
Now, I want to take on this point of the reservation of certain seats on the bench for certain philosophies, which it seems as if we have heard a great deal about today that you need to be like Sandra Day O’Connor in judicial philosophy to be able to go on her seat on the bench. Some interest groups have put forward that philosophy and argued that you deserve closer scrutiny because you don’t appear to have the same philosophy, or even opposition if it is not determined that you do not have the same judicial philosophy. This testimony suggests that that would change the ideological balance, that you would change that ideological balance, there-

fore, you should not be approved. And I say that that notion is not anywhere in the understanding of the role of the judges. It creates a double standard for your approval and looks conveniently—it looks suspiciously convenient for the opposition to put forward.
Seats on the bench are not reserved for causes or interests. They are given to those who will uphold the rule of law so long as the nominee is well qualified to interpret and apply the law. This has long been the case of the Supreme Court. And I want to note here that historically the makeup of the Court has changed just as elected branches have changed. In fact, nearly half of the Justices, 46 of 109, who have served on the Supreme Court replaced Justices appointed by a different political party. In recent years, even as the Court has become an increasingly political body, the Senate is not focused on preserving any perceived ideological balance when Democrat Presidents have appointed people to the Court. And the best example of that is the Senate rejecting that notion when Ruth Bader Ginsburg came in front of the Senate and was approved 96– 3 to be on the Supreme Court to replace conservative Justice Byron White. This was in 1993.
Now, Justice Ginsburg, it was noted earlier, was the general counsel for the ACLU, certainly a liberal group. It was abundantly clear during the confirmation hearing that Ginsburg would swing the balance of the Court to the left. But because President Clinton won the election and because Justice Ginsburg clearly had the intellectual ability and integrity to serve on the Court, she was confirmed.
During her hearing, hardly any mention was made about balance with Justice White. The only discussion that occurred about Justice White was when Senator Kohl, our colleague, asked her what she thought of Justice White’s career. And she started off by saying that she was not an athlete.
History has shown that she did, in fact, dramatically change the balance of the Court in many critical areas, such as abortion, the privacy debate expansion, and child pornography. And I have behind me three of the key cases where Justice White ruled one way, even wrote the majority opinion, and Justice Ginsburg ruled the other way with the majority. You talk about a swing of balance, and yet the issue was not even raised at Justice Ginsburg’s confirmation hearing, and yet now it seems as if that is the paramount issue—not only the paramount issue, it actually makes you have to go to a higher standard to be approved. And that is just simply not the way we have operated in the past, nor is it the way we should operate now.
As I stated at Justice Roberts’s hearing, the Court has injected itself into many of the political debates of our day, and as my colleague Senator Cornyn has mentioned, the Court has injected itself in the definition of marriage, deciding whether or not human life is worth protecting, permitting Government to transfer private property from one person to another, even interpreting the Constitution on the basis of foreign and international laws.
The Supreme Court has also issued and never reversed a number of decisions that are repugnant to the Constitution’s vision of human dignity and equality. Although cases like Brown v. Board of Education in my State are famous for correcting constitutional

47
and court errors, there remain several other instances in which the Court strayed and stayed beyond the Constitution and the laws of the United States. Among the most famous of these Supreme Court cases of exercise of political power, I believe, are the cases of Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, two 1973 cases based on false statements which created a constitutional right to abortion. And you can claim whatever you want to of being pro-life or pro-choice, but the right to abortion is not in the Constitution. The Court created it. It created a constitutional right. And these decisions removed a fully appropriate political judgment from the people of several States and has led to many adverse consequences.
For instance, it has led to the almost complete killing of a whole class of people in America. As I noted to my colleagues in the Roberts hearings, this year—this year—between 80 to 90 percent of the children in America diagnosed with Down syndrome will be killed in the womb simply because they have a positive genetic test— which can be wrong and is often wrong, but they would have a positive genetic test for Down syndrome and they will be killed.
America is poorer because of such a policy. We are at our best when we help the weakest. The weak make us strong. To kill them makes us all the poorer, insensitive, calloused, and jaded. Roe has made it not only possible but has found it constitutional to kill a whole class of people simply because of their genetic makeup. This is the effect of Roe.
I think this is a proper issue for us to consider, and the judge you are replacing noted one time ‘‘that the Court’s unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing abortion has had this institutionally debilitating effect should not be surprising since the Court is not suited to the expansive role it has claimed for itself in the series of cases that began with Roe.’’
You will have many issues in front of you, many that we will not discuss here in front of this committee. I think it unfortunate that we only narrow in on so few of the cases that you are likely to hear in front of you. And yet that is the nature of the day because they are the hot, political, heat-seeking cases. You are undoubtedly qualified. You are cited by the ABA to be unanimously well qualified. I look forward to a thorough discussion and a hopeful approval of you to be able to join the Supreme Court of the United States.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Brownback. We now move to the final opening statement. When we finish the statement of Senator Coburn, we are going to go right to the presenters, Senator Lautenberg and Governor Whitman. So I would like them to be on notice that we will be doing that in just a few moments, and following Senator Lautenberg and Governor Whitman, we will be hearing from Judge Alito. Senator Coburn, the floor is yours.

One of the advantages of going last is to be able to hear what everybody else has said, and as I have listened today, we have talked about the unfortunate, the frail. The quotes have been ‘‘fair shake for those that are underprivileged.’’ We have heard values, ‘‘strong, free, and fair,’’ ‘‘progress of our judiciary.’’ We have heard ‘‘the vulnerable, the more vulnerable, the weak, those who suffer.’’ We have heard of an ‘‘Alito mold’’ that has to be in the mold of somebody else. And as a practicing physician, the one disheartening thing that I hear is these very common words, this ‘‘right to choose,’’ and how we sterilize that to not talk about what it really is.
I have had the unfortunate privilege of caring for over 300 women who have had complications from this wonderful right to choose to kill their unborn babies. And that is what it is. It is a right of convenience to take the life. And the question that arises as we use all these adjectives and adverbs to describe our positions as we approach a Supreme Court nominee is where are we in America when we decide that it is legal to kill our unborn children. I mean, it is a real question for us. I debate honestly with those who disagree with me on this. It is a real issue of measurement of our society when we say it is fine to destroy unborn life who has a heartbeat at 16 days post-conception; 39 days post-conception you can measure the brain waves and there is pain felt. The ripping and tearing of an unborn child from its mother’s womb through the hands of another and we say that is fine, you have a constitutional right to do that.
How is it that we have a right of privacy and due process to do that, but you do not have the right, as rejected unanimously by the Supreme Court in 1997, to take your own life in assisted suicide. You know, how is it that we have sodomy protected under that due process, but prostitution unprotected. It is schizophrenic. And the reason it is schizophrenic is there is no foundation for it whatsoever other than a falsely created foundation that is in error.
I don’t know if we will ever change that. It is a measure of our society. But the fact is you cannot claim in this Senate hearing to care for those that are underprivileged, those that are at risk, those that are vulnerable, those that are weak, those that are suffering, and at the same time say I don’t care about those who have been ripped from the wombs of women and the complications that have come about throughout that.
So the debate for the American public and the real debate here is about Roe. Don’t let it—we are going to go off in all sorts of directions, but the decisions that are going to be made in votes on the Committee and the votes on the floor is going to be about Roe, whether or not we as a society have decided that this is an ethical process, that we have this convenient process that, if we want to rationalize one moral choice with another, we just do it through abortion, this taking of the life—of life of an unborn child.
I asked Chief Justice Roberts about this definition of life. You know, what is life? The Supreme Court cannot figure it out or does not want to figure it out. The fact that we know that there is no life if there is no heartbeat and brain waves, we know that in every State and every territory. But when we have heartbeat and brain waves, we refuse to accept it as the presence of life. This lack of

49
logic of which we approach this issue because we like and we favor convenience over ethics, we favor convenience over the hard parts of life that actually make us grow.
Senator Brownback talked about those with disabilities that are destroyed in the womb because of a genetic test that is sometimes wrong. I would put forward that we all have disabilities. Some of us, you just can’t see it. And yet who makes the decision on whether or not we’re qualified or not. We have gone down a road to which we don’t have the answers for. That is why we have the schizophrenic decisions coming out of the Supreme Court that don’t balance logically with one versus another decision.
So my hope as we go through this process is to not confuse it with easy words and really be honest and straightforward about what this is about. I firmly believe that the Court should take another direction on many of these moral issues that face us. If we are to honor the heritage of our country, whether it be in terms of religious freedom, whether it be in terms of truly protecting life, protecting not just the unborn but who comes next, the infirm, the elderly, the maimed, the disabled—that is who comes next. As we get into the budget crunch of taking care of those people in the years to come, I believe we ought to have that debate honestly and openly. But the fact is we are going to cover it with everything except the real fact is we have made a mistake going down that road in terms of saying we can destroy our unborn children and there are no consequences to it.
So I welcome you. This is a difficult process for you and your family. I am hopeful that you will be treated fairly. I am very disturbed at the picture that was painted by Senator Kennedy that you are not a man of your word, that you are dishonest. The implication that you are not reliable I don’t think is a fair characterization of what I have read. And I look forward to you being able to give answers as you can to your philosophy. The real debate is we have had an activist Court, and the American people do not want an activist Court. And the real fear from those who might oppose you is that you will bring the Court back within a realm of where the American people might want us to be with the Supreme Court, one that interprets the law, equal justice under the law, but not advancing without us advancing, the legislative body advancing ahead of you.
I welcome you. I return the balance of my time, and I look forward to your introduction and your opening statement.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. We will now turn to our presenting witnesses, Senator Lautenberg and Governor Whitman. In accordance with our standing rules of the Committee, the presenters will each have 5 minutes. They have been so informed, and we first welcome our colleague, Senator Frank Lautenberg, to present Judge Alito.

PRESENTATION OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, NOMINEE TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, BY HON. FRANK LAUTENBERG, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
Senator LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Senator Leahy, colleagues on this Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify here today. John Corzine, U.S. Senator, and now Governor-elect in New Jersey, wanted to be here, but transition duties in Trenton prevent him from doing so.
Now, I have been honored to serve in the U.S. Senate for 21 years, and I am convinced that our duty to provide advice and consent for Justices of the Supreme Court is our most important constitutional responsibility. Our mandate is to be a Nation of laws, and the Supreme Court is the place where we look to safeguard our civil rights and our individual liberties.
But I believe that Justices must recognize that our Constitution is an 18th century document that needs to be applied in the context of the 21st century. We also depend on the Supreme Court to uphold the integrity of our Government. So I am privileged to have the opportunity to introduce Sam Alito, Jr., to this Committee, and his beautiful family that he brought along to fortify his candidacy.
Judge Alito was born and raised in the great State of New Jersey. Our State has a legacy of producing outstanding jurists, most notably the late William J. Brennan, who ushered in our Nation’s re-commitment to civil rights in the latter half of the 20th century. Another distinguished jurist, Justice Antonin Scalia, also was born in New Jersey.
In 1950, Sam Alito was born in our State’s capital city, Trenton, New Jersey, to a family of worthy achievement. Judge Alito’s father—I am moving too quickly here—Judge Alito’s father was an immigrant from Italy who taught history in high school and later ran the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, which is similar to our own congressional Research Service, in that it provides objective, unbiased information to the legislature. Judge Alito’s mother was a librarian, teacher and school principal, and she is now 91 and still, as I understand it, residing in the family home in Hamilton, New Jersey.
From his parents, Judge Alito learned the importance of education and integrity. Judge Alito and his sister went to public school in Hamilton, New Jersey, where they both joined the debating team. It seemed like the debating experience paid off, as both he and his sister have excelled in the legal profession.
Sam Alito then went on to Princeton University, where his yearbook entry predicted that one day he would warm a seat on the Supreme Court. He graduated from Yale School in 1975, and then served as a clerk for Circuit Court Judge Leonard Garth, with whom he currently serves.
In 1977, Sam Alito joined the U.S. Attorney’s office in Newark, where he met his future wife, Martha, who is present here today. They later moved to Washington, where Sam Alito served as an assistant to the Solicitor General and later in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel.

In 1987, Judge Alito returned home to New Jersey after President Reagan appointed him U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. He was a strong prosecutor, and nobody was surprised when President George H.W. Bush appointed him to the Third Circuit Court in 1990, and I had the privilege of introducing him then as well.
Judge Alito’s accomplishments in life are the embodiment of the American dream. I am honored today to introduce him to the Committee. He is a young man. If the Senate confirms him for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, he could serve for three decades, or even longer, especially judging it from my point of view. His decisions would affect our rights, the rights of our children, our grandchildren, and other future generations.
Mr. Chairman, you know well it is the job of this Committee to evaluate Judge Alito’s qualifications and fitness for the Court, including his views on legal issues. And I know every member of the Committee takes that obligation seriously, and I trust that Judge Alito will be forthcoming and cooperative in this process. I have had a chance to meet him. I know that he responded to the questions that I put to him. Maybe they were too easy, but he responded very well to them.
I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here with our former Governor, Christie Whitman, and we haven’t sat at a table together for a long time, but it is a good opportunity to do so.
Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Lautenberg, do you care to make a recommendation on the nominee? Senator LAUTENBERG. I care to present the evidence, just the evidence, Mr. Chairman, and we will let the record speak for itself. Chairman SPECTER. Our next presenter is Governor Whitman, distinguished two-term Governor for the State of New Jersey, and in the Cabinet of President Bush as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. We welcome you here, Governor Whitman, and look forward to your testimony.
PRESENTATION OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, NOMINEE TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, BY CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, AND FORMER ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY
Governor WHITMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here today with Senator Lautenberg to introduce Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., and I do urge your support for his nomination to the Supreme Court.
I won’t go into his family background. Senator Lautenberg has done that—save to mention one member of the family that he didn’t, which is that the Judge’s sister, Rosemary, is a nationally recognized employment attorney and someone who is recognized as part of a family that has devoted itself to public service and continues to do that.

Judge Alito personifies the motto of the civic pride embodied in the slogan of his hometown, ‘‘Trenton makes, the world takes.’’ And with the consent of the Senate, one of the most important bodies in the world, the U.S. Supreme Court, can take a proud product of Trenton, New Jersey, into their chambers.
But I am not here to discuss Judge Alito’s family background or his State ties. I am here to discuss his own history of achievement and his potential to be a great Associate Justice of our Supreme Court.
Sam Alito has excelled at everything he has undertaken. He was an exceptional student at Princeton University and Yale Law School, an outstanding young attorney at the Justice Department, an accomplished United States Attorney, and for the past 15 years has been a respected and exemplary Federal Appeals Court Judge.
The American Bar Association just gave him their highest rating for his seat as Justice, and in his past two appearances before the Senate for confirmation, he has received unanimous support.
There is, however, more to my support of Judge Alito. Like other Americans, I have read many articles dissecting positions Judge Alito has taken throughout his career, trying to discern how he might decide on issues likely to appear before the Supreme Court that he would confront as a Justice. I too have examined the record. In the final analysis, my decision to support Judge Alito for this position is not based on whether I agree with him on a particular issue or set of issues or on his conformity with any particular political ideology. In fact, while we may agree on some political issues, I know there are others on which we disagree. Nevertheless, one’s agreement or disagreement on a political question is, after all, ultimately irrelevant to the issue of whether or not Judge Alito should serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Court’s role is not to rule based on Justices’ personal persuasions, rather on persuasive arguments grounded on fact, those facts presented in that particular case, and on their interpretation of the Constitution. Those decisions are, of course, grounded in the hard reality of disputed fact and the messiness of the real world, but they are also guided by principles of law and justice which have long been treasured by the people of this country. We should look for Justices who understand that instinctively in the very core of their being. I saw this trait in Judge Alito when he served on the Appeals Court during my terms as Governor, and I have every reason and every confidence that he will exhibit the same as a Supreme Court Justice.
Policy in the United States is defined through the laws crafted by the legislative branch of Government and carried out by the executive. Our judges make decisions based on their interpretation of the intent of those laws. We do not want Justices to conform their decisions’ ideologies. We do want Justices whose opinions are shaped by the facts before them and by their understanding of the Constitution. We should also look for Justices who possess the necessary qualities of intellect and humility, desirable in those with great responsibility and who can express their thinking clearly and in understandable language. While we should expect the Justices will hold philosophies that will guide their decisions, we should

equally expect that they will not hold ideologies that will predetermine their decisions. That is the genius of our system.
Mr. Chairman, some have suggested that Judge Alito has an ideological agenda. I believe that an honest and complete review of his record as a whole will find that his only agenda is fidelity to his judicial craft. If Judge Alito has a bias, it is in favor of narrowly drawn opinions that respect precedent and reflect the facts before him.
Members of the Committee, yours is an extraordinary responsibility. Decisions by our Supreme Court will affect the lives of Americans for generations to come. As politicians, whether current or retired, we all have deeply held positions we want to protect. When I was Governor, it fell to me five times to appoint members of the New Jersey State Supreme Court. One thing that experience taught me was that it is virtually impossible to find judges who will act as you would act were you in their position. That is as it should be. Your responsibility is to the extent possible to determine whether or not the nominee before you has the legal background, intelligence and integrity to be a credit to the Court.
Sam Alito has been a model as a Federal Appeals Court Judge. He has shown that he has the intellect, the experience and the temperament to serve with true distinction. I have every confidence he will be a balanced, fair and thoughtful Justice. I urge this Committee to favorably report his nomination to the U.S. Senate.
Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Governor Whitman. Without objection, the statement of Senator Corzine will be made a part of the record. We appreciate your coming, Senator Lautenberg, appreciate your coming Governor Whitman. Judge Alito, if you will resume center stage. Judge, you can remain standing. We now come to the formal swearing in of the nominee. I count 41 cameras in the well. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. And there are just behind you, a grouping of cameras, seven in number, and I see three more. So you are well up to 50, which exceeds the number present, only 28, for Chief Justice Roberts. So that may be an omen. I am stalling for time a little bit here to allow the photographers to position themselves. They have sat, if not patiently, impatiently, all day. We may move the swearing in to the beginning of the ceremony in the future so they can all go out and do something productive. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. If you would raise your right hand, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the Committee of the Judiciary of the U.S. Senate will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Judge ALITO. I do. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Judge Alito. You may be seated, and we welcome whatever opening comments you care to make.

STATEMENT OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, NOMINEE TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Judge ALITO. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am deeply honored to appear before you. I am deeply honored to have been nominated for a position on the Supreme Court, and I am humbled to have been nominated for the seat that is now held by Justice O’Connor. Justice O’Connor has been a pioneer, and her dedicated service of the Supreme Court will never be forgotten, and the people of the country certainly owe her a great debt for the service that she has provided.
I am very thankful to the President for nominating me, and I am also thankful to the members of this Committee and many other Senators who took time from their busy schedules to meet with me. That was a great honor for me, and I appreciate all of the courtesies that were extended to me during those visits. And I want to thank Senator Lautenberg and Governor Whitman for coming here today and for their kind introductions.
During the previous weeks, an old story about a lawyer who argued a case before the Supreme Court has come to my mind, and I thought I might begin this afternoon by sharing that story. The story goes as follows:
This was a lawyer who had never argued a case before the Court before, and when the argument began, one of the Justices said, ‘‘How did you get here?’’ meaning how had his case worked its way up through the court system. But the lawyer was rather nervous, and he took the question literally, and he said—and this was some years ago. He said, ‘‘I came here on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.’’
This story has come to my mind in recent weeks because I have often asked myself how in the world did I get here. And I want to try to answer that today and not by saying that I came here on I– 95 or on Amtrak.
I am who I am in the first place because of my parents and because of the things that they taught me, and I know from my own experience as a parent that parents probably teach most powerfully not through their words but through their deeds. And my parents taught me through the stories of their lives, and I don’t take any credit for the things that they did or the things that they experienced. But they made a great impression on me.
My father was brought to this country as an infant. He lost his mother as a teenager. He grew up in poverty. Although he graduated at the top of his high school class, he had no money for college, and he was set to work in a factory. But at the last minute, a kind person in the Trenton area arranged for him to receive a $50 scholarship, and that was enough in those days for him to pay the tuition at a local college and buy one used suit. And that made the difference between his working in a factory and going to college.
After he graduated from college, in 1935, in the midst of the Depression, he found that teaching jobs for Italian-Americans were not easy to come by, and he had to find other work for a while. But eventually he became a teacher, and he served in the Pacific during

World War II, and he worked, as has been mentioned, for many years in a nonpartisan position for the New Jersey Legislature, which was an institution that he revered.
His story is a story that is typical of a lot of Americans, both back in his day and today, and it is the story, as far as I can see it, about the opportunities that our country offers and also about the need for fairness and about hard work and perseverance and the power of a small good deed.
My mother is a first-generation American. Her father worked in the Roebling Steel Mill in Trenton, New Jersey. Her mother came from a culture in which women generally did not even leave the house alone, and yet my mother became the first person in her family to get a college degree. She worked for more than a decade before marrying. She went to New York City to get a master’s degree, and she continued to work as a teacher and a principal until she was forced to retire. Both she and my father instilled in my sister and me a deep love of learning.
I got here in part because of the community in which I grew up. It was a warm but definitely an unpretentious, down-to-earth community. Most of the adults in the neighborhood were not college graduates. I attended the public schools. In my spare time, I played baseball and other sports with my friends. And I have happy memories and strong memories of those days and good memories of the good sense and the decency of my friends and my neighbors.
And after I graduated from high school, I went a full 12 miles down the road, but really to a different world, when I entered Princeton University. A generation earlier, I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton, but by the time I graduated from high school, things had changed. And this was a time of great intellectual excitement for me. Both college and law school opened up new worlds of ideas. But this was back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was a time of turmoil at colleges and universities. And I saw some very smart people and very privileged people behaving irresponsibly, and I couldn’t help making a contrast between some of the worst of what I saw on the campus and the good sense and the decency of the people back in my own community.
I am here in part because of my experiences as a lawyer. I had the good fortune to begin my legal career as a law clerk for a judge who really epitomized open-mindedness and fairness. He read the record in detail in every single case that came before me. He insisted on scrupulously following precedents, both the precedents of the Supreme Court and the decisions of his own court, the Third Circuit. He taught all of his law clerks that every case has to be decided on an individual basis, and he really didn’t have much use for any grand theories.
After my clerkship finished, I worked for more than a decade as an attorney in the Department of Justice, and I can still remember the day as an Assistant U.S. Attorney when I stood up in court for the first time and I proudly said, ‘‘My name is Samuel Alito, and I represent the United States in this court.’’ It was a great honor for me to have the United States as my client during all of those years.

I have been shaped by the experiences of the people who are closest to me, by the things I have learned from Martha; by my hopes and my concerns for my children, Phillip and Laura; by the experiences of members of my family, who are getting older; by my sister’s experiences as a trial lawyer in a profession that has traditionally been dominated by men. And, of course, I have been shaped for the last 15 years by my experiences as a judge of the court of appeals.
During that time, I have sat on thousands of cases. Somebody mentioned the exact figure this morning. I don’t know what the exact figure is, but it is way up in the thousands. And I have written hundreds of opinions. And the members of this Committee and the members of their staff who have had the job of reviewing all of those opinions really have my sympathy.
[Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I think that may have constituted cruel and unusual punishment. I have learned a lot during my years on the Third Circuit, particularly, I think, about the way in which a judge should go about the work of judging. I have learned by doing, by sitting on all of these cases, and I think I have also learned from the examples of some really remarkable colleagues. When I became a judge, I stopped being a practicing attorney, and that was the big change in role. The role of a practicing attorney is to achieve a desirable result for the client in the particular case at hand. But a judge can’t think that way. A judge can’t have any agenda. A judge can’t have any preferred outcome in any particular case. And a judge certainly doesn’t have a client. The judge’s only obligation—and it’s a solemn obligation—is to the rule of law, and what that means is that in every single case, the judge has to do what the law requires. Good judges develop certain habits of mind. One of those habits of mind is the habit of delaying reaching conclusions until everything has been considered. Good judges are always open to the possibility of changing their minds based on the next brief that they read or the next argument that is made by an attorney who is appearing before them or a comment that is made by a colleague during the conference on the case, when the judges privately discuss the case. It has been a great honor for me to spend my career in public service. It has been a particular honor for me to serve on the court of appeals for these past 15 years because it has given me the opportunity to use whatever talent I have to serve my country by upholding the rule of law. And there is nothing that is more important for our Republic than the rule of law. No person in this country, no matter how high or powerful, is above the law, and no person in this country is beneath the law. Fifteen years ago, when I was sworn in as a judge of the court of appeals, I took an oath. I put my hand on the Bible and I swore that I would administer justice without respect to persons, that I would do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I would carry out my duties under the Constitution and the laws of the United States. And that is what I have tried to do to the very best

Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Alito, for those opening comments. We will adjourn at this point, and we will resume tomorrow morning at 9:30, when we will start the first round of questioning with each Senator on round one having 30 minutes.

NOMINATION OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
TUESDAY, JANUARY 10, 2006
U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman SPECTER. The Judiciary Committee will now proceed with the confirmation hearing of Judge Alito for the Supreme Court. Before beginning the first round of questioning, just a little review as to our procedure. As announced, there will be a 30-minute allocation for each Senator. We intend to work rather late this afternoon, perhaps even into the early evening. I do not know that it is possible to complete the first round of questioning today. That would be a good objective. We will see how it goes. Judge Alito, you are free to let us know whenever you want to break. We will take a couple of breaks at the midpoint of the morning and the afternoon, but there are 18 of us and only one of you, so when you would like a break, your schedule takes precedence over ours. Before beginning the opening round, let me yield to my colleague, Senator Leahy, to see if he has some additional comments. Senator LEAHY. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also appreciate the fact we have kept to the clock. I think it has been helpful, and I would hope that Judge Alito would bear with us on that. We will have a lot of questions. I think to take the time to get to them all— you have always been accommodating about that—I think that that requires cooperation on both sides of the dais. We do have the advantage, Mr. Chairman, that we did not have with Judge Roberts’s hearings, that we are not in session and we are not going to be interrupted by votes, and we have the time to do it. I would hope that we do not go into a marathon for both his sake and us older guys’ sake. But I do appreciate that you have run this with fairness and even-handedness, and I appreciate that.

Chairman SPECTER. Since there are no older guys involved or gals, we can consider the marathon, but we will keep it within bounds. You can start the clock. I will maintain the clock meticulously, as we have maintained timing as our Judiciary Committee practice.
Judge Alito, you will be faced with many, many questions on many topics. I am going to start today with a woman’s right to choose, move to Executive power, and then hopefully within the 30 minutes pick up congressional power.
Starting with a woman’s right to choose, Judge Alito, do you accept the legal principles articulated in Griswold v. Connecticut, that the Liberty Clause and the Constitution carries with it the right to privacy?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I do agree that the Constitution protects a right to privacy, and it protects the right to privacy in a number of ways. The Fourth Amendment certainly speaks to the right of privacy. People have a right to privacy in their homes and in their papers, and in their persons. And the standard for whether something is a search is whether there’s an invasion of a right to privacy, a legitimate expectation of privacy.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, Griswold dealt with the right to privacy on contraception for married women. Do you agree with that?
Judge ALITO. I agree that Griswold is now I think understood by the Supreme Court as based on the Liberty Clauses of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment.
Chairman SPECTER. Do you agree also with Eisenstadt which carried forward Griswold to single people?
Judge ALITO. I do agree with the result in Eisenstadt. Chairman SPECTER. Let me move now directly into Casey v. Planned Parenthood, and picking up the gravamen of Casey as it has applied, Roe on the woman’s right to choose, originating from the Privacy Clause with Griswold being its antecedent, and I want to take you through some of the specific language of Casey to see what your views are, and what weight you would ascribe to this rationale as you would view the woman’s right to choose. In Casey the joint opinion said, ‘‘People have ordered their thinking and lives around Roe. To eliminate the issue of reliance would be detrimental. For two decades of economic and social development people have organized intimate relationships and reliance on the availability of abortion in the event contraception should fail.’’ Pretty earthy language, but that is the Supreme Court’s language. The Court went on to say, ‘‘The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has become facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.’’ Now that states in specific terms the principle of reliance, which is one of the mainstays, if not the mainstay, on stare decisis precedent to follow tradition. How would you weigh that consideration on the woman’s right to choose? Judge ALITO. Well, I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important doctrine. It’s a fundamental part of our legal system, and it’s the principle that courts in general should follow their past precedents, and it’s important for a variety of reasons. It’s important because it limits the power of the judiciary. It’s important because it protects reliance interest, and it’s important because it re-

319
flect the view that courts should respect the judgments and the wisdom that are embodied in prior judicial decisions. It’s not an inexorable command, but it is a general presumption that courts are going to follow prior precedents, and as you mentioned—
Chairman SPECTER. How do you come to grips with the specifics where the Court, in the joint opinion, spoke of reliance on the availability of abortion in the event contraception should fail, on that specific concept of reliance?
Judge ALITO. Well, reliance is, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, one of the important foundations of the doctrine of stare decisis. It is intended to protect reliance interests, and people can rely on judicial decisions in a variety of ways. There can be concrete economic reliance. Government institutions can be built up in reliance on prior decisions. Practices of agencies and Government officials can be molded based on reliance. People can rely on decisions in a variety of ways. In my view—
Chairman SPECTER. Let me move on to another important quotation out of Casey. Quote: ‘‘A terrible price would be paid for overruling Casey, for overruling Roe. It would seriously weaken the Court’s capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law, and to overrule Roe under fire would subvert the Court’s legitimacy.’’
Do you see the legitimacy of the Court being involved in the precedent of Casey?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think that the Court, and all the courts, the Supreme Court, my court, all the Federal courts, should be insulated from public opinion. They should do what the law requires in all instances. That’s why they’re not—that’s why the members of the judiciary are not elected. We have a basically democratic form of Government, but the judiciary is not elected, and that’s the reason, so that they don’t do anything under fire. They do what the law requires.
Chairman SPECTER. But do you think there is as fundamental a concern as legitimacy of the Court would be involved if Roe were to be overturned?
Judge ALITO. Mr. Chairman, I think that the legitimacy of the Court would be undermined in any case if the Court made a decision based on its perception of public opinion. It should make its decisions based on the Constitution and the law. It should not be— it should not sway in the wind of public opinion at any time.
Chairman SPECTER. Let me move to just the final quotation that I intend to raise from Casey, and it is, ‘‘After nearly 20 years of litigation in Roe’s wake, we are satisfied that the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe’s resolution of the issue, but the precedentual force that must be accorded to its holding.’’ That separates out the original soundness of Roe, which has been criticized, and then lays emphasis on the precedentual value. How would you weigh that consideration were this issue to come before you if confirmed?
Judge ALITO. Well, I agree that in every case in which there is a prior precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare decisis, and the presumption is that the Court will follow its prior precedents. There needs to be a special justification for overruling a prior precedent.

320
Chairman SPECTER. Let me turn to an analogous situation, and that is Chief Justice Rehnquist’s change of heart on the Miranda ruling. In 1974 in the case of Michigan v. Tucker, he was then Justice Rehnquist, wrote an opinion severely limiting Miranda, in effect stating he did not like it. Then in the year 2000 in the case of United States v. Dickerson, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote an opinion of holding Miranda, and he did that because, ‘‘Miranda was embedded in the routine police practices to a point where the warnings have become a part of our National culture.’’
Now, there has been an analogy made from what Chief Justice Rehnquist said on the Miranda issue to the Roe issue. How would you evaluate the consideration of Roe being embedded in the culture of our society?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think that Chief Justice Rehnquist there was getting at a very important point, and—
Chairman SPECTER. Think he was right? Judge ALITO. I think he was getting at—he was right in saying that reliance can take many forms. It can take a very specific and concrete form, and there can be reliance in the sense that he was talking about there, and I think what he’s talking about there is that a great many people, and in that instance, police departments around the country, over a long period of time, had adapted to the Miranda rule, had internalized it. I think that all the branches of Government had become familiar with it and comfortable with it, and had come to regard it as a good way—after a considerable breaking in period—a good way of dealing with a difficult problem, and the problem was how to deal with interrogations leading to confessions, in terms of— Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, let me move to the dissenting opinion by Justice Harlan in Poe v. Ullman, where he discusses the constitutional concept of liberty and says, ‘‘The traditions from which liberty developed, that tradition is a living thing.’’ Would you agree with Justice Harlan that the Constitution embodies the concept of a living thing? Judge ALITO. I think the Constitution is a living thing in the sense that matters, and that is that it is—it sets up a framework of Government and a protection of fundamental rights that we have lived under very successfully for 200 years, and the genius of it is that it is not terribly specific on certain things. It sets out some things are very specific, but it sets out some general principles, and then leaves it for each generation to apply those to the particular factual situations that come up. Chairman SPECTER. Would you agree with Cardozo on Palco that it represents the values of a changing society? Judge ALITO. The liberty component of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment, which I was talking about earlier, embody the deeply rooted traditions of the country, and it’s up to each— those traditions and those rights apply to new factual situations that come up. As times change, new factual situations come up, and the principles have to be applied to those situations. The principles don’t change. The Constitution itself doesn’t change, but the factual situations change, and as new situations come up, the principles and the rights have to be applied to them.

321
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, the commentators have characterized Casey as a super precedent. Judge Luttig, in the case of Richmond Medical Center, called the Casey decision super stare decisis. In quoting from Casey, Judge Luttig pointed out, the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed. Then in support of Judge Luttig’s conclusion that Casey was super stare decisis, he refers to Stenberg v. Carhart, and quotes the Supreme Court, saying, ‘‘We shall not revisit these legal principles.’’ That is a pretty strong statement for the Court to make, that we shall not revisit the principles upon which Roe was founded, and the concept of super stare decisis or super precedent arises as the commentators have characterized it, by a number of different Justices appointed by a number of different judges over a considerable period of time. Do you agree that Casey is a super precedent or a super stare decisis as Judge Luttig said?
Judge ALITO. Well, I personally would not get into categorizing precedents as super precedents or super duper precedents, or any—
Chairman SPECTER. Did you say ‘‘super duper?’’ [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. Right. Chairman SPECTER. Good. Judge ALITO. Any sort of categorization like that— Chairman SPECTER. I like that. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO [continuing]. Sort of reminds me of the size of laundry detergent in the supermarket. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I agree with the underlying thought that when a precedent is reaffirmed, that strengthens the precedent, and when the Supreme Court says that we are not— Chairman SPECTER. How about being reaffirmed 38 times? Judge ALITO. Well, I think that when a precedent is reaffirmed, each time it’s reaffirmed that is a factor that should be taken into account in making the judgment about stare decisis, and when a precedent is reaffirmed on the ground that stare decisis precludes or counsels against reexamination of the merits of the precedent, then I agree that that is a precedent on precedent. Now, I don’t want to leave the impression that stare decisis is an inexorable command because the Supreme Court has said that it is not, but it is a judgment that has to be based, taking into account all of the factors that are relevant and that are set out in the Supreme Court’s cases. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, during the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts, I displayed a chart. I do not ordinarily like charts, but this one I think has a lot of weight because it lists all 38 cases which have been decided since Roe, where the Supreme Court of the United States had the opportunity to—Senator Hatch is in the picture now. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. It is a good photo op for Senator Hatch. Senator Leahy is complaining. [Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. Just balance it on Orrin’s head. Senator HATCH. Put that over by Leahy.

Chairman SPECTER. He wants it on his side. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. I think the point of it is that there have been so many cases, so many cases, 15 after your statement in 1985 that I am about to come to, and eight after Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which is why it has special significance, and I am not going to press the point about super precedent. I am glad I did not have to mention super duper, that you did. Thank you very much. Let me come now to the statement you made in 1985, that the Constitution does not provide a basis for a woman’s right to an abortion. Do you agree with that statement today, Judge Alito? Judge ALITO. Well, that was a correct statement of what I thought in 1985 from my vantage point in 1985, and that was as a line attorney in the Department of Justice in the Reagan administration. Today if the issue were to come before me, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed and the issue were to come before me, the first question would be the question that we’ve been discussing, and that’s the issue of stare decisis. And if the analysis were to get beyond that point, then I would approach the question with an open mind, and I would listen to the arguments that were made. Chairman SPECTER. So you would approach it with an open mind notwithstanding your 1985 statement? Judge ALITO. Absolutely, Senator. That was a statement that I made at a prior period of time when I was performing a different role, and as I said yesterday, when someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge thinks about legal issues. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, coming to the role you had in the Solicitor General’s Office, where you wrote the memorandum in the Thornburgh case, urging restriction and ultimate appeal of Roe, that was in your capacity as an advocate. And I have seen your other statements that the role of an advocate is different from the role of a judge. But when you made the statement that the Constitution did not provide for the right to an abortion, that was in a statement you made where you were looking to get a job, a promotion within the Federal Government. So there is a little difference between the 1985 statement and your advocacy role in the Thornburgh memorandum, is there not? Judge ALITO. Well, there is, Senator, and what I said was that that was a true expression of my views at the time, the statement in the 1985 appointment form that I filled out. It was a statement that I made at a time when I was a line attorney in the Department of Justice. I’m not saying that I made the statement simply because I was advocating the administration’s position, but that was the position that I held at the time, and that was the position of the administration. Chairman SPECTER. Would you state your views, the difference as you see it between what you did as an advocate in the Solicitor General’s Office to what your responsibilities would be, are on the Third Circuit, or what they would be on the Court if confirmed as a judicial capacity?

323
Judge ALITO. Well, an advocate has the goal of achieving the result that the client wants within the bounds of professional responsibility. That’s what an advocate is supposed to do, and that’s what I attempted to do during my years as an advocate for the Federal Government. Now, a judge doesn’t have a client, as I said yesterday, and a judge doesn’t have an agenda, and a judge has to follow the law. An important part of the law in this area, as we look at it in 2006, is the law of stare decisis.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, you have written some 361 opinions that I would like to have the time to discuss quite a few of them with you, but I am only going to pick up one in the first round, and that is an opinion you wrote in the Elizabeth Blackwell Health Center for Women v. Knoll, and that was a case where there was a challenge between a Pennsylvania statute, which required as a prerequisite to a woman getting Medicaid, that she would have had to have reported a rape or an incest to the police, and second, a requirement that there be a second opinion from a doctor that she needed an abortion to save her life. And that statutory requirement, those two provisions conflicted with a regulation by the Department of Health and Human Services. You were on the Third Circuit, which held that the Pennsylvania statute should be stricken in deference to the rule of the Health and Human Services Department. And Judge Nygaard entered a very forceful dissent saying that this was an interpretive rule and it was inappropriate to have that kind of an interpretive rule by the Department countervail a statute.
What was your thinking in that case? Had you been predisposed to take a tough line on a woman’s right to choose or on Medicaid support for someone who had been raped, you would have upheld the statute. What was your thinking in that case?
Judge ALITO. Well, what you said is correct, Senator. I cast the deciding vote there to strike down the Pennsylvania statute, and I did it because that’s what I thought the law required. I thought the law required that we defer to the interpretation of the Federal statute that had been made by the Department of Health and Human Services. If I had had an agenda to strike down any—I’m sorry, to uphold any regulation of abortion that came up in any case that was presented to me, then I would have voted with Judge Nygaard in that case, and that would have turned the decision the other way.
I’ve sat on three abortion cases on the Third Circuit. In one of them—that was the Casey case—I voted to uphold regulations of abortion, and in the other two—the Elizabeth Blackwell case and Planned Parenthood v. Farmer—I voted to strike them down. And in each instance, I did it because that’s what I thought the law required.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, I want to turn now to Executive power and to ask you first if you agree with the quotation from Justice Jackson’s concurrence in the Youngstown Steel seizure case about the evaluation of Presidential power that I cited yesterday.
Judge ALITO. I do. I think it provides a very useful framework, and it has been used by the Supreme Court in a number of important subsequent cases, in the Dames and Moore, for example, involving the release of the hostages from Iran. And it doesn’t answer
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00335 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

324
every question that comes up in this area, but it provides a very useful way of looking at them.
Chairman SPECTER. Do you agree with Justice O’Connor’s statement quoted frequently yesterday from Hamdi that, ‘‘We have long since made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens,’’ when she was citing the Youngstown case? Do you agree with that?
Judge ALITO. Absolutely. That’s a very important principle. Our Constitution applies in times of peace and in times of war, and it protects the rights of Americans under all circumstances.
Chairman SPECTER. You made a speech at Pepperdine where you said, in commenting about the decision of the Supreme Court in Ex Parte Milligan, that ‘‘The Constitution applies even in an extreme emergency.’’ The Government made a ‘‘broad and unwise argument’’ that the Bill of Rights simply doesn’t apply during wartime.
Do you stand by that statement? Judge ALITO. I certainly do, Senator. The Bill of Rights applies at all times, and it’s particularly important that we adhere to the Bill of Rights in times of war and in times of national crisis, because that’s when there’s the greatest temptation to depart from them. Chairman SPECTER. Steering clear, Judge Alito, of asking you how you would decide a specific case, I think it is very important to find out your jurisprudential approach in interpreting whether the September 14, 2001, congressional resolution authorizing the use of force constituted congressional authorization for the National Security Agency to engage in electronic surveillance where one party to the conversation was in the United States. Let me take just a moment to lay out the factual and legal considerations. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 provides it ‘‘shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance shall be conducted and the interpretation of domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.’’ The Government contends that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act clause, ‘‘except as authorized by statute, opens the door to interpreting that resolution to authorize the surveillance.’’ Let me give you a series of questions. I don’t like to put more than one on the table at a time, but I think they are necessary in this situation to give the structure as to where I am going. First, in interpreting whether Congress intended to amend FISA by that resolution, would it be relevant that Attorney General Gonzales said we were advised that ‘‘that was not something we could likely get.’’ Second, if Congress had intended to amend FISA by the resolution, wouldn’t Congress have specifically said so, as Congress did in passing the PATRIOT Act, giving the Executive greater flexibility in using roving wiretaps? Third, in interpreting statutory construction on whether Congress intended to amend FISA by the resolution, what would the relevance be of rules of statutory construction that repeal or change by implication—that changes by—makes the repeal by implication or disfavor, and specific statutory language trumps more general pronouncements? How would you weigh and evaluate the President’s war powers under Article II to engage in electronic surveil-

325
lance with the warrant required by congressional authority under Article I in legislating under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act? And let me start with the broader principles.
In approaching an issue as to whether the President would have Article II powers, inherent constitutional authority to conduct electronic surveillance without a wiretap, when you have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act on the books, making that the exclusive means, what factors would you weigh in that format?
Judge ALITO. Well, probably the first consideration would be to evaluate the statutory question, and you outlined some of the factors and the issues that would arise in interpreting the statute, what is meant by the provision of FISA that you quoted regarding FISA—the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—being the exclusive means for conducting surveillance. And then, depending on how one worked through that statutory question, then I think one might look to Justice Jackson’s framework. And he said that he divided cases in this area into three categories where the President acts with explicit or implicit congressional approval, where the President acts and Congress has not expressed its view on the matter one way or the other, and the final category where the President exercises Executive power and Congress—and that is in the face of an explicit or implicit congressional opposition to it. And depending on how one worked through the statutory issue, then the case might fall into one of those three areas.
But these questions that you pose are obviously very difficult and important and complicated questions that are quite likely to arise in litigation, perhaps before my own court or before the Supreme Court.
Chairman SPECTER. Before pursuing that further—and we will have a second round—I want to broach one other issue with you. My time is almost up. That is, in the memorandum you wrote back on February 5, 1986, about the President’s power to put a signing statement on to influence interpretation of the legislation, you wrote this: ‘‘Since the President’s approval is just as important as that of the House or Senate, it seems to follow that the President’s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress.’’
Is that really true when you say the President’s views are as important as Congress’s? The President can express his views by a veto and then gives Congress the option of overriding a veto, which Congress does not have if the President makes a signing declaration and seeks to avoid the terms of the statute. And we have the authority from the Supreme Court that the President cannot impound funds, cannot pick and choose on an appropriation. We have the line item veto case where the President cannot strike a provision even when authorized by Congress.
Well, I have got 10 second left. I guess when my red light goes on, it does not affect you. You can respond. Care to comment?
[Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I do, Senator. I think the most important part of the memo that you are referring to is a fairly big section that discussed theoretical problems, and it consists of a list of questions, and many of the questions are the questions that you have just raised. In that memo, I said this is an unexplored area, and here
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00337 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

326
are the theoretical questions that—and, of course, they are of more than theoretical importance—that arise in this area.
That memo is labeled a rough first effort at stating the position of the administration. I was writing there on behalf of a working group that was looking into the question of implementing a decision that had already been made by the Attorney General to issue signing statements for the purpose of weighing in on the meaning of statutes. And in this memo—as I said, it was a rough first effort, and the biggest part of it, to my mind, was the statement there are difficult theoretical interpretive questions here and here they are. And had I followed up on it—and I don’t believe I had the opportunity to pursue this issue further during my time in the Justice Department—it would have been necessary to explore all those questions.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, my red light went on. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. Well, Judge, good morning. Judge ALITO. Good morning, Senator. Senator LEAHY. You survived yesterday listening to us. Now we have a chance to listen to you. I will have further questions on the memo that Senator Specter spoke of, but it gets beyond the theoretical. The last few weeks, we have seen it well played out in the press where the President and Senator John McCain negotiated rather publicly an amendment, which passed overwhelmingly in the House and the Senate, outlawing the use of torture by United States officers, yet the President in a signing statement implies that it will not apply to him or to those under his command as commander in chief. Doesn’t that get well beyond a theoretical issue there? Judge ALITO. It is, and I think I said in answering the Chairman that there are theoretical issues but they have considerable practical importance. But the theoretical issues really have to be explored and resolved. I don’t believe the Supreme Court has done that up to this point. I have not had occasion in my 15-plus years on the Third Circuit to come to grips with the question of what is the significance of a Presidential signing statement in interpreting a statute. Senator LEAHY. Let me follow with a related issue. I feel one of the most important functions of the Supreme Court is to stop our Government from intruding into Americans’ privacy or our freedom or our personal decisions. In my State of Vermont, we value our privacy very, very much. I think most Americans do automatically, and many times they have to go to the courts to make sure that the Government does not—whatever part of the Government it is, whatever administration it might be—that they do not overreach in going into that privacy. Three years ago, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department—and you are familiar with that; you worked there years ago—they issued a legal opinion, which they kept very secret, in which they concluded that the President of the United States had the power to override domestic and international laws outlawing torture. It said the President could override these laws outlawing torture.

They tried to redefine torture, and they asserted, I quote, that the President enjoys ‘‘complete authority over the conduct of war,’’ and they went on further to say that if Congress passed a criminal law prohibiting torture ‘‘in a manner that interferes with the President’s direction of such core matters as detention and interrogation of enemy combatants,’’ that would be unconstitutional. They seemed to say that the President could immunize people from any prosecution if they violated our laws on torture. And that remained the legal basis in this administration until somebody apparently at the Justice Department leaked it to the press and it became public. Once it became public, with the obvious reaction of Republicans, Democrats, everybody saying this is outrageous, it is beyond the pale, the administration withdrew that opinion as its position. The Attorney General even said in his confirmation that this no longer—no longer—represented Bush administration policy.
What is your view—and I ask this because the memo has been withdrawn. It is not going to come before you. What is your view of the legal contention in that memo that the President can override the laws and immunize illegal conduct?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think the first thing that has to be said is what I said yesterday, and that is that no person in this country is above the law, and that includes the President and it includes the Supreme Court. Everybody has to follow the law, and that means the Constitution of the United States and it means the laws that are enacted under the Constitution of the United States.
Now, there are questions that arise concerning Executive powers, and those specific questions have to be resolved, I think, by looking to that framework that Justice Jackson set out that I mentioned earlier.
Senator LEAHY. Well, let’s go into one of those specifics. Do you believe the President has the constitutional authority as commander in chief to override laws enacted by Congress and to immunize people under his command from prosecution if they violate these laws passed by Congress?
Judge ALITO. Well, if we were in—if a question came up of that nature, then I think you’d be in where the President is exercising Executive power in the face of a contrary expression of congressional will through a statute or even an implicit expression of congressional will. You would be in what Justice Jackson called ‘‘the twilight zone,’’ where the President’s power is at its lowest point, and I think you would have to look at the specifics of the situation. These are the gravest sort of constitutional questions that come up, and very often they don’t make their way to the judiciary or they are not resolved by the judiciary. They are resolved by the other branches of the Government.
Senator LEAHY. But, Judge, I am a little bit troubled by this because you suggested, and I completely agreed with what you said, that no one is above the law and no one is beneath the law. You are not above the law, I am not, the President is not. But are you saying that there are situations where the President not only could be above the law passed by Congress, but could immunize others, thus putting them above the law?
I mean, listen to what I am speaking to specifically. We passed a law outlawing certain conduct. The President in his Bybee memo,

328
which has now been withdrawn, was saying that that law won’t apply to me or people that I authorize. doesn’t that place not only the President but anybody he wants above the law?
Judge ALITO. Senator, as I said, the President has to follow the Constitution and the laws and, in fact, one of the most solemn responsibilities of the President—and it is set out expressly in the Constitution—is that the President is to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and that means the Constitution, it means statutes, it means treaties, it means all of the laws of the United States.
But what I am saying is that sometimes issues of Executive power arise and they have to be analyzed under the framework that Justice Jackson set out. And you do get cases that are in this twilight zone and it is—they have to be decided when they come up based on the specifics of the situation.
Senator LEAHY. But are you saying that there could be instances where the President could not only ignore the law, but authorize others to ignore the law?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, if you are in that situation, you may have a question about the constitutionality of a congressional enactment. You have to know the specifics of—
Senator LEAHY. Let’s assume there is not a question of the constitutionality of the enactment. Let’s make it an easy one. We pass a law saying it is against the law to murder somebody here in the United States. Could the President authorize somebody, either from an intelligence agency or elsewhere, to go out and murder somebody and escape prosecution or immunize the person from prosecution, absent a Presidential pardon?
Judge ALITO. Neither the President nor anybody else, I think, can authorize someone to—can override a statute that is constitutional. And I think you are in this—when you are in the third category, under Justice Jackson, that is the issue which you are grappling with.
Senator LEAHY. But wouldn’t it be constitutional for the Congress to outlaw Americans from using torture?
Judge ALITO. And Congress has done that, and it is certainly an expression of a very deep value of our country.
Senator LEAHY. And if the President were to authorize somebody to torture or say that he would immunize somebody from prosecution for doing that, he wouldn’t have that power, would he?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I think the important points are that the President has to follow the Constitution and the laws, and it is up to Congress to exercise its legislative power. But as to specific issues that might come up, I really need to know the specifics. I need to know what was done and why it was done, and hear the arguments on the issue.
Senator LEAHY. Let’s go to some specifics. Senator Specter mentioned FISA and your role with FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Certainly, you had to be involved with it, and appropriately so, when you were a U.S. Attorney. This law came in after the abuses of the 1960s and 1970s. We had had President Nixon’s enemies list, with the government breaking into doctors’ offices and wiretapping innocent Americans, and so on. After that, the Congress in a strong bipartisan effort passed the FISA legislation. We

329
have that court which can handle applications in secret for wiretaps or surveillance, if necessary, for national security.
Now, we have just learned that the President has chosen to ignore the FISA law and the FISA court. He has issued secret orders, and according to the press and the President’s own press conference, time after time after time secret orders for domestically spying on American citizens without obtaining a warrant.
Do you believe the President can circumvent the FISA law, and bypass the FISA court to conduct warrantless spying on Americans?
Judge ALITO. The President has to comply with the Fourth Amendment and the President has to comply with the statutes that are passed. This is an issue I was speaking about with Chairman Specter that I think is very likely to result in litigation in the Federal courts. It could be in my court. It certainly could get to the Supreme Court and there may be statutory issues involved—the meaning of the provision of FISA that you mentioned, the meaning certainly of the authorization for the use of military force—and those would have to be resolved.
And in order to resolve them, I would have to know the arguments that are made by the contending parties. On what basis is it claimed that there is a violation? On what basis would the President claim that what occurred fell within the authorization of the authorization for the use of military force? And then if you got beyond that, there could be constitutional questions about the Fourth Amendment, whether it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment, whether it was the valid exercise of Executive power.
Senator LEAHY. But wouldn’t the burden be on the Government to prove that it wasn’t a violation of the Fourth Amendment if you were spying on Americans without a warrant, especially when you have courts set up—in this case the FISA court, which sets up a very easy procedure to get the warrant? Wouldn’t the burden be on the Government in that case?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I think the in first instance the Government would have to come forward with its theory as to why the actions that were taken were lawful. I think that is correct.
Senator LEAHY. Well, let me ask you another one. You are saying this may come before the Third Circuit or could come before the Supreme Court, and I will accept that. But how does somebody even get there? If you are conducting illegal secret spying on a person, how are they even going to know? Where are they going to get the standing to sue?
Judge ALITO. Certainly, if someone is the subject of a search and they claim that the search violates a statute or it violates the Constitution, then they would have standing to sue and they could sue in a Federal court that had jurisdiction.
Senator LEAHY. And I am not asking these as hypothetical questions, Judge. People are getting very concerned about this. We just found out, again not because the Government told us, but because the press found out about it—and thank God that we do have a free press because so much of the stuff that is supposed to be reported to Congress never is, and we first hear about it when it is in the press.

But we found out that the Department of Defense is going around—and this makes me think of COINTELPRO during the Vietnam War—they are going around the country photographing and spying on people who are protesting the war in Iraq. They went, according to the press, and spied on Quakers in Vermont.
Now, I don’t know why they spent all that money to do that. If they want to find a Vermonter protesting the war, turn on C– SPAN. I do it on the Senate floor all the time. But I know some of these Quakers. I mean, in the Quaker tradition, they have been protesting war throughout this country’s history.
Now, I worry about this culture we are getting, and I just want to make sure since Congress is not going to stand up and say no, and the administration certainly is authorizing this—I want to make sure that the courts are going to say we will respect your privacy, we will respect your Fourth Amendment rights.
You know, if you have somebody who has been spied on, would you agree—and I think you did, but I want to make sure I am correct on this—do you agree that they should have a day in court?
Judge ALITO. Certainly. If someone has been the subject of illegal law enforcement activities, they should have a day in court and that is what the courts are there for, to protect the rights of individuals against the government and to—or anyone else who violates their rights. And they have to be absolutely independent and treat everybody equally.
Senator LEAHY. And those Fourth Amendment rights are pretty significant, are they not?
Judge ALITO. They are very significant. Senator LEAHY. I think they set us apart from most other countries in the world, to our betterment. And you were a prosecutor; I was a prosecutor. I think we can agree even looking of our past professions that it protects us. Judge ALITO. I agree, Senator. I tried to follow what the Fourth Amendment required when I was a prosecutor and I regard it as very important. Senator LEAHY. Well, let me go back to the last time we saw Government excesses like this before FISA. When you worked in the Reagan administration, you argued to the Supreme Court that President Nixon’s Attorney General should have absolute immunity for domestic spying without a warrant even in the case of willful misconduct. In your memo you said, ‘‘I do not question that the Attorney General should have immunity, but for tactical reasons I would not raise the issue here.’’ Do you believe today that the Attorney General would be absolutely immune from civil liability for authorizing warrantless wiretaps? Judge ALITO. No, he would not. That was settled in that case. The Supreme Court held that the Attorney General does not have— Senator LEAHY. But you did believe so then? Judge ALITO. Actually, I recommended that that argument not be made. It was made and I think it is important to understand the context of that. First of all— Senator LEAHY. You did say in the memo, ‘‘I do not question that the Attorney General should have this immunity.’’

331
Judge ALITO. That is correct, and the background of that, if I could just explain very briefly—
Senator LEAHY. Sure. Judge ALITO [continuing]. Is that we were—there, we were not just representing the Government; we were representing former Attorney General Mitchell in his individual capacity. He was being sued for damages and we were, in a sense, acting as his private attorney. And this was an argument that he wanted to make. This was an argument that had been made several times previously by the Department of Justice during the Carter administration and then just a couple of years earlier in Harlow v. Fitzgerald in the Reagan administration. And I said I didn’t think it was a good idea to make the argument in this case, but I didn’t dispute that it was an argument that was there. Senator LEAHY. You don’t have any question that the judiciary has a role to play here and there can be judicial checks on such things? Judge ALITO. No. Absolutely, it is the job of the judiciary to enforce the Constitution. Senator LEAHY. Let’s go into a couple search cases, and I think we have indicated to you that we would bring these up—Doe v. Groody, Baker v. Monroe Township. Those are unauthorized searches. In Doe, the police officers had a warrant for a man at a certain address. When they arrived, they found his wife and 10year-old daughter. They were not in the warrant, they posed no threat. But the officers detained them and strip-searched them, the wife and the 10-year-old, the 10-year-old girl. In Baker, a mother and her three teenage children were detained and searched when they arrived at the home of the mother’s adult son. They didn’t live there. They were not in the home. They were outside. They didn’t pose a threat to the police, but they were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. They were handcuffed, they were taken into the house and they were searched. In Doe, the strip-search case of the 10-year-old girl, the officers didn’t ask for permission to search anybody beyond the man they were looking for. In fact, the magistrate didn’t give a search warrant for anybody else. But you went beyond that and you said that they were justified in strip-searching this 10-year-old and the mother. You went beyond the four corners of the search warrant the magistrate gave. And one of your members of the Third Circuit, Judge Chertoff, who is now the head of Homeland Security and a former prosecutor, criticized your reasoning. He said that it would come dangerously close to displacing the critical role of the independent magistrate. Do you continue to hold the position you took in your opinion or do you now agree with the majority that they are right and you are wrong? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I haven’t had occasion to think that what I said in that case was correct, but let me just explain what was going on there. Senator LEAHY. Sure. Judge ALITO. The issue there was whether—the first issue was whether the warrant authorized the search of people who were on
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00343 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

the premises and that was the disagreement between me and the majority and it was a rather technical issue about whether the affidavit that was submitted by police officers was properly incorporated into the warrant for the purposes of saying who could be searched.
And I thought that it was, and I thought that it was quite clear that the magistrate had authorized a search for people who were on the premises. That was the point of disagreement. I was not pleased that a young girl was searched in that case and I said so in my opinion. That was an undesirable thing, but the issue wasn’t whether there should be some sort of rule of Fourth Amendment law that a minor can never be searched. And I think if we were to—
Senator LEAHY. But we both agree on that, Judge. The only reason I bring up these two cases is it seems in both of them you went beyond the four corners of the search warrant and you settled all issues in a light most favorable—the majority in the opinion didn’t, but you did—in a light most favorable to law enforcement. In fact, in Baker, the majority said that.
And I worry about this because I always worry that the courts must be there to protect individuals against an overreaching government. In this case, your position in the minority was that you protected what the majority felt was an overreaching government.
Am I putting too strong an analysis on that? Judge ALITO. I do think you are, Senator. Senator LEAHY. OK. Judge ALITO. I think you need to take into account what was going on here. The police officers prepared an affidavit and they said we have probable cause to believe that this drug dealer hides drugs on people who are on the premises. And therefore, when we search, we want authorization not just to search him, but to search everybody who is found on the premises because we think he hides—we have reason to believe he hides drugs there. And the magistrate who issued the warrant said that the affidavit was incorporated into the warrant for the purpose of establishing probable cause. And we are supposed to read warrants in a common-sense fashion because they are prepared by police officers for the most part, not by lawyers, and they are often prepared under a lot of time pressure. And it seemed to me that, reading this in a common-sense fashion, what the magistrate intended to do was to say, yes, you have authorization to do what you ask us to do. But even beyond that, the issue there was whether these police officers could be sued for damages, and they couldn’t be sued for damages if a reasonable officer could have believed that that is what the magistrate intended to authorize. And I thought that surely a reasonable officer could view it that way. Now, Judge Chertoff looked at it differently and there are cases where reasonable people disagree, and that is all that was going on. Senator LEAHY. I know. You look for what a reasonable officer would think—I spent 8 years in law enforcement. I don’t know where any reasonable officer under those circumstances would feel they could strip-search a 10-year-old girl.

Let me go into another area, and it is one that touched me in your statement yesterday. You spoke eloquently of your father’s experience when he came to this country. The reason it touched me is I was thinking that, when my maternal grandparents emigrated to America, to Vermont, speaking only Italian, coming from Italy to a new country, I know some of the problems they faced—these people speaking this strange language. My mother was a child learning English when she went to school. People asking, ‘‘Why don’t they speak like us? Why are they different than us’’; those were just some of the obstacles they faced.
In my father’s case, my paternal grandfather, whom I never knew, named Patrick Leahy, died as a stonecutter in Barre, Vermont. My father was a young teen and had to go to work to support his mother, my grandmother, whom I also never knew. And the signs then were ‘‘No Irish Need Apply’’ or ‘‘No Catholics Need Apply.’’ And I think you and I would be in total agreement that we are now at a different world in at least most of our country and that we are better people because we have done away with that.
What we both understand, I think, in our core, I would hope, is what happens if you have either ethnic prejudice or religious prejudice. In my case, my father was a self-taught historian, but he never was able to finish high school. I was the first Leahy to get a college degree, my sister the next one.
So with that in mind, there was something in your background that I was troubled with. That is the Concerned Alumni of Princeton University, CAP. This was a group that received attention because it was put together, but it resisted the admission of women and minorities to Princeton. They were hostile to what they felt were people that did not fit Princeton’s traditional mold—women and minorities.
Now, two prominent Princetonians—one, Bill Frist, who is now the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, in a committee, roundly criticized CAP. Bill Bradley, who had joined it and then found out what it was, left it, and roundly criticized it. And yet you, proudly in 1985, well after this criticism, in your job application, proudly wrote that you were a member of it, a member of Concerned Alumni of Princeton University, a conservative alumni group.
Why, in heaven’s name, Judge, with your background and what your father faced, why in heaven’s name are you proud of being part of CAP?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I have racked my memory about this issue, and I really have no specific recollection of that organization. But since I put it down on that statement, then I certainly must have been a member at that time. But if I had been actively involved in the organization in any way, if I had attended meetings or been actively involved in any way, I would certainly remember that, and I don’t.
I have tried to think of what might have caused me to sign up for membership, and if I did, it must have been around that time. And the issue that had rankled me about Princeton for some time was the issue of ROTC. I was in ROTC when I was at Princeton, and the unit was expelled from the campus. And I felt that was

very wrong. I had a lot of friends who were against the war in Vietnam, and I respected their opinions, but I didn’t think that it was right to oppose the military for that reason. And the issue, although the Army unit was eventually brought back, the Navy and the Air Force units did not come back, and the issue kept coming up. And there were people who were strongly opposed to having any unit on campus, and the attitude seemed to be that the military was a bad institution and that Princeton was too good for the military, and that Princeton would somehow be sullied if people in uniform were walking around the campus, that the courses didn’t merit getting credit, that the instructors shouldn’t be viewed as part of the faculty. And that was the issue that bothered me about that.
Senator LEAHY. But, Judge, with all due respect, CAP was most noted for the fact that they were worried that too many women and too many minorities were going to Princeton. In 1985, when everybody knew that is what they stood for, when a prominent Republican like Bill Frist and a prominent Democrat like Bill Bradley, both had condemned it, you, in your job application, proudly stated this as one of your credentials.
Now, you strike me as a very cautious and careful person, and I say that with admiration, because a judge should be. But I cannot believe that at 35, when you are applying for a job, that you are going to be anything less than careful in putting together such a job application, and frankly, I do not know why that was a matter of pride for you at that time.
My time is up. We will come back to this. I have other questions. Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, as you said, from what I now know about the group, it seemed to be dedicated to the idea of bringing back the Princeton that existed at a prior point in time, and as you said, somebody from my background would not have been comfortable in an institution like that, and that certainly was not any part of my thinking in whatever I did in relation to this group. Senator LEAHY. Or my background either, Judge, or my background either. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. Welcome, Judge Alito. We appreciate you and the service that you have given, but much has been made about your membership in an organization called the Concerned Alumni of Princeton. Now, you mentioned this organization in your 1985 job application for a position in President Reagan’s administration. And you have told us what you felt—you know about your membership in that organization. So is it fair to say that you were not a founding member? Judge ALITO. I certainly was not a founding member. Senator HATCH. You were not a board member? Judge ALITO. I was not a board member. Senator HATCH. Or, for that matter, you were not even an active member of the organization, to the best of your recollection? Judge ALITO. I don’t believe I did anything that was active in relation to this organization.

Senator HATCH. Now, some have suggested, as my friend from Massachusetts did yesterday, that by your membership in this organization, you are somehow against the rights of women and minorities attending colleges. So let me just ask you directly on the record: Are you against women and minorities attending colleges?
Judge ALITO. Absolutely no, Senator, no. Senator HATCH. I felt that that would be your answer. I really did. [Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. Tough question, Orrin. Tough question. Senator HATCH. It is a good question, though. It is one that kind of overcomes the implications that you were. Judge ALITO. Senator, I had never attended a non-coeducational school until I went to Princeton, and after I was there a short time, I realized the benefits of attending a co-educational school. [Laughter.] Senator HATCH. Now, I am glad that you mentioned in your opening statement yesterday that a decade earlier, a person like yourself—and by this, I assume you meant someone of Italian ancestry. Judge ALITO. I do, Senator, and someone not from any sort of exalted economic status. Senator HATCH. Modest background, son of an immigrant father, and a person who had gone to public school and might not have been fully welcomed sometimes at Princeton at that time. Now, people like me are not even sure of what an eating club is, but it sure as heck does not sound like a cafeteria. Judge ALITO. No. It’s something like a fraternity, except it’s just a facility. It’s a private facility where students eat. Traditionally, they were selective. They had a process like Vicker and they chose people that they thought fit in with the group. Senator HATCH. Sure. Judge ALITO. And I did not choose to belong to an eating club. I belonged to a university facility called Stevenson Hall, which was named after Adlai Stevenson, and it was one of the most co-educational facilities on the campus. It was not selective. It was attractive to me because a lot of faculty members went there for lunch. There was a master who lived on the facility with his family, and it was an opportunity at dinner and lunch to talk to faculty members. Senator HATCH. Well, much has been written about the just and egalitarian changes that took place at Princeton and other elite institutions in the 1960s, making them more welcoming to persons without an elite background. It has been alleged by some—most prominently, I might add, by a Democratic witness who was withdrawn at the last minute because of some politically embarrassing comments that he made—that your membership in this group demonstrates your desire to maintain some old boys’ network to the detriment of women and minorities. Could you comment on that particular suggestion? Judge ALITO. I certainly had no such desire, and I think that what I did when I was a student at Princeton and my activities since then illustrate that.

As I said, when I was at Princeton, I was a member of this university facility, and it was open to everybody, and it was one of the most co-educational facilities on the campus. And since graduating, I have actually been involved in a way in the admissions process. I was on the Schools Committee for a number of years and interviewed applicants to Princeton, and I think that shows my attitude toward the general way in which the university has been run.
Senator HATCH. Well, ROTC programs are an excellent opportunity for young men and women to attend college and to serve their country through service in the armed forces. Now, there are actually more military officers who were ROTC students than went to West Point, the Naval Academy, or the Air Force Academy. Now, that includes the eminent Colin Powell.
Now, you were a member of the ROTC; is that true? Judge ALITO. I was, Senator. Senator HATCH. You were a proud member of the ROTC. Judge ALITO. I was. Senator HATCH. Did you enjoy your time in the ROTC and in the Army afterward? Judge ALITO. I was proud to be a member, and the unit was thrown off the campus after—well, the decision was made shortly after I joined the ROTC, and so I attended the ROTC classes on the campus during my junior year, but during my senior year the unit had been expelled from the campus, and I had to go to Trenton State College occasionally to finish up my ROTC work. Senator HATCH. I heard a report yesterday that the ROTC building on the Princeton campus was actually firebombed at about the same time that American servicemen of college age were fighting in Vietnam. Is that accurate? Judge ALITO. That’s correct. It was very extensively damaged. Senator HATCH. Was anybody injured? Judge ALITO. I don’t recall that anybody was injured, but certainly there’s a serious risk of injury whenever an arson takes place. Senator HATCH. Now, Judge Alito, some Senators and left-wing activist groups have focused on one case involving the Vanguard Company, claiming that your consideration of that case amounts to some kind of ethical lapse. Now, I would observe that the universal opinion is that you have unquestioned integrity and a record that is above reproach. I know we will hear from the American Bar Association later this week, but I know their highest rating includes the highest marks for integrity. In fact, I have a copy of their recommendations here. On the issue of integrity, it says, ‘‘The matter of integrity is selfdefining. A nominee’s character and general reputation in the legal community are investigated, as are his or her industry and diligence. Judge Alito enjoys an excellent reputation for integrity and character, notwithstanding a widespread awareness of the Vanguard and Smith Barney recusal issues. During his personal interview with us, Judge Alito was asked about the recusal matter in detail, and he acknowledged at length that he takes the matter of recusal very seriously and that the cases had ‘slipped through’ the court’s screening process.’’

I won’t read the whole matter, but let me just go toward the end. ‘‘Judge Alito explained to the satisfaction of the Standing Committee the special circumstances that resulted in the screen not working or otherwise not being applied in these limited matters’’— that is, the screening of cases—‘‘and he further accepted responsibility for the errors. We accept his explanation and do not believe these matters reflect adversely on him. To the contrary, consistent and virtually unanimous comment from those interviewed included ‘He has the utmost integrity’; ‘he is a straight shooter, very honest, and calls them as he sees them’; ‘his reputation is impeccable’; ‘you can find no one with better integrity’; ‘his integrity and character are of the highest caliber’; ‘he is completely forthright and honest’; ‘his integrity is absolutely unquestionable’; ‘he is a man of great integrity.’ ’’
‘‘On the basis of our interviews with Judge Alito with well over 300 judges, lawyers, and members of the legal community nationwide, all of whom know Judge Alito professionally, the Standing Committee concluded that Judge Alito is an individual of excellent integrity.’’
Now, the reason I want to go into this is to kind of get rid of this problem that I think is as phony as anything I have ever seen in my time around here. Like I say, this case has been written about or reported on for weeks in bits and pieces so that getting a clear picture of the facts is indeed a challenge, let alone getting a clear picture of the ethical issues involved as well. And I know you have not had a chance to respond to any of it publicly, so I want to give you that chance now.
Now, please take a few minutes and briefly describe the facts of the case, and then I have a few questions on the issues that are raised by the case.
Judge ALITO. Thank you, Senator, and I appreciate the opportunity to address this because a lot has been said about it and very little by me. And I think that once the facts are set out, I think that everybody will realize that in this instance I not only complied with the ethical rules that are binding on Federal judges—and they’re very strict—but also that I did what I have tried to do throughout my career as a judge, and that is to go beyond the letter of the ethics rules and to avoid any situation where there might be an ethical question raised.
And this was a case where—this is a case that came up in 2002, 12 years after I took the bench, and I acknowledge that if I had to do it over again, there are things that I would have done differently. And it’s not because I violated any ethical standard, but it’s because when this case first came before me, I did not focus on the issue of recusal and apply my own personal standard, which is to go beyond what the code of conduct for judges requires.
This was a pro se case, and we take our pro se cases very seriously.
Senator HATCH. By pro se, explain that. Judge ALITO. It’s a case where the plaintiff was not represented by a lawyer. She was representing—she was representing— Senator HATCH. Paying for her own counsel and represented herself.

Judge ALITO. She represented herself initially, and we take those very seriously. We give those just as much consideration—in fact, more consideration in many respects than we do with the cases without lawyers because we take into account that somebody who’s representing himself or herself can’t be expected to comply with all the legal technicalities.
But for whatever reason, our court system for handling the monitoring of recusals in these pro se cases is different from the system that we use in the cases with lawyers. And maybe that’s because recusal issues don’t come up very often in pro se cases. But, in any event, in a case with a lawyer, before the case is ever sent to us, we receive what are known as clearance sheets, and those are—it’s a stack of papers and it lists all the cases that the clerk’s office is thinking of sending to us. It lists the parties in each case, and it lists the lawyers in each case. And it says, ‘‘Do you need to recuse yourself in any of these cases?’’ And this is the time when the judges and this is the time when I focus on the issue of recusal, and I look at each case. I look at the parties. I look at the lawyers. And I ask myself: Is there a reason why I should not participate in the case?
Now, because this case, the Monga case, was a pro se case, it didn’t come to me with clearance sheets. I just received the briefs, and it had been through our staff attorneys’ office. They take a first look at the pro se cases, and they try to make sure—they try to translate the pro se arguments into the sort of legal arguments that lawyers would make to help the pro se litigants. And they give us a recommended disposition and a draft opinion.
And when this came to me, I just didn’t focus on the issue of recusal, and I sat on the initial appeal in the case. And then after the case was decided, I received a recusal motion. And I was quite concerned because I take my ethical responsibilities very seriously.
So I looked into the question of whether I was required under the code—because I just wanted to see where the law was on this. Was I required under the code of conduct to recuse myself in this case? And it seemed to me that I was not. And a number of legal experts, experts on legal ethics, have now looked into this question, and their conclusion is no, I was not required to recuse.
But I didn’t stand on that because of my own personal policy of going beyond what the code requires, so I did recuse myself. And not only that, I asked that the original decision in the case be vacated, that is, wiped off the books and that the losing party in the case, the appellant, Ms. Monga, be given an entirely new appeal before an entirely new panel. And that was done.
I wanted to make sure that she did not go away from this case with the impression that she had gotten anything less than an absolutely fair hearing. And then beyond that, I realized that the fact that this has slipped through in a pro se case pointed to a bigger problem, and that was the absence of clearance sheets.
So since that time, I have developed my own forms that I use in my own chambers, and for pro se cases now, there is—I have a red sheet of paper printed up, and it is red so nobody misses it. And when a pro se case comes in, it initially goes to my law clerks, and they prepare a clearance sheet for me in that case, and then they do an initial check to see whether they spot any recusal problem.

339
And if they don’t, then there’s a space at the bottom where they initial it. And then it comes to me, and there’s a space at the bottom for me to initial to make sure that I focus on the recusal problem. And in very bold print at the bottom of the sheet for my secretary, it says, ‘‘No vote is to be sent in in this case unless this form is completely filled out.’’
So there are a number of internal checks now in my own office to make sure that I follow my own policy of going beyond what the code requires.
Senator HATCH. In other words, there was never any possibility of you benefiting financially no matter how that case came out. Is that right?
Judge ALITO. Absolutely no chance. Senator HATCH. And you actually did recuse yourself when the question was eventually raised, even though you didn’t have to. Judge ALITO. That’s correct, Senator. Senator HATCH. Did you genuinely feel that you were either legally or ethically required to recuse under those circumstances? Judge ALITO. I did not think the code required— Senator HATCH. You were just going beyond, which has been your philosophy and— Judge ALITO. That’s right. Senator HATCH [continuing]. Ethical response, your personal ethical approach to it. Well, your own conclusion certainly is supported by the independent ethics experts that you mentioned who have recently examined this case. I know one of them is Professor Geoffrey Hazard from the University of Pennsylvania. That name stuck out in particular because I remember when a financial conflict of interest issue arose in connection with the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. In 1994, Senator Kennedy and I, we strongly defended the Breyer nomination. I did, too. And during the hearings, Senator Kennedy highlighted a letter from Professor Geoffrey Hazard to answer Justice Breyer’s critics. Well, Professor Hazard has examined this matter, and concluded that you, Judge Alito, handled it, in his words, ‘‘quite properly.’’ Now, Mr. Chairman, I would like to put not only Professor Hazard’s letter into the record, but the letter of Steven Lubet, Thomas Morgan, and Professor Ronald Rotunda, all of whom found that you made no ethical mistakes. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, all will be made a part of the record. Senator HATCH. And let me just observe that these are all top ethics experts in our country today, and, you know, I have to say that Rotunda—or Morgan, of the George Washington University Law School, he happens to be the co-author of the Nation’s most widely read ethics textbook. Now, he was blunt in his assessment saying that there was simply no basis for suggesting that you did anything improper. So I am glad to put those in the record. Now, you actually did more than simply recusing yourself in this case. As you have explained, you even set up a special system to make sure that, you know, there never is going to be a question about this. And so you went farther than you were legally or ethically mandated to do.

Judge ALITO. I did, Senator, and that is what I have tried to do throughout my time on the bench.
Senator HATCH. Now, when the new panel of judges looked at this case, how did they rule?
Judge ALITO. They ruled the same way that we had, and we had ruled the same way that the district court did.
Senator HATCH. OK. So let me just clarify this one more time, and you tell me if this accurately describes the situation. You did not believe that you were ethically or legally required to recuse yourself in this case. All the ethics experts agree with you. Yet you recused yourself anyway when the issue was raised. The party raising the issue got an entirely new hearing before a new and different panel of judges, who ruled the same way that you did originally.
Does that about sum it up? Judge ALITO. That’s correct, Senator. Senator HATCH. Well, I have to say, Judge, that you went above and beyond your ethical duties here, and I think you are to be applauded, not to be criticized, for your rigorous attention to judicial impartiality and integrity. Now, let me just go into another matter here before I finish here. Some Supreme Court nominees have had legislative experience. The Justice you will replace, Justice O’Connor, served in the Arizona State Senate. Justice Breyer was chief counsel to Senator Kennedy when he chaired this Committee. I have tremendous respect for both of them. Judge Alito, you have had no legislative experience, and there are those of us who are concerned that your many years of experience in the executive branch may have biased you in favor of Executive power, or at least some feel that way and that that is a possibility. Yesterday, one of my Democratic colleagues claimed that your instincts are to defer to the Executive, to grant prosecutors whatever power they seek, that sort of thing. I suppose that in 15 years on the appeals court you have participated in what I would estimate at nearly 5,000 cases. You have had many opportunities to review challenges to Executive power. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. I have, yes. Senator HATCH. Well, I am thinking of cases such as United States v. Kithcart, where you reversed a criminal conviction because the police lacked probable cause for a search, or Bolden v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, where you ruled for a former maintenance custodian for a public transportation agency, concluding that the Fourth Amendment barred a suspicionless drug test. I want to make it clear that simply giving such examples of results on the other side of the ledger does not by itself prove that you are a good judge or a bad judge. Without also talking about the facts and the law in each case, merely tabulating winners and losers does not offer much. But since my colleagues on the other side occasionally have their tally sheets and actually some have even claimed that you may be biased when certain results seem to suit them, could you give me some more examples of cases where you voted against Executive powers?

341
Judge ALITO. Yes, certainly, Senator. Brinson v. Vaughn is an example of that. That was a habeas case involving a murder conviction, and I concluded and my panel concluded—and I wrote the opinion saying that there had been racial discrimination, or enough to have a hearing on the possibility of racial discrimination in the selection of the jury in that case. And, therefore, we reversed the decision of the district court.
Williams v. Price is another example. There we found—and that was another murder case, and so what is involved here in these cases is really the most important thing that is litigated on the criminal side in the Federal courts. That was a case where the district court had denied a writ of habeas corpus, and we reversed because we found that there had been an error in excluding testimony that showed racial bias on the part of the jurors.
There was another murder case, United States v. Murray. This was a Federal prosecution, and we had to reverse there because we concluded—and I wrote the opinion there—that the prosecutors had introduced evidence—
Senator HATCH. Well, you could go on and on, but my point is that in approximately 5,000 cases, you can find just about anything you want to, to pluck out and say, ‘‘Oh, he didn’t do right here,’’ or ‘‘He did right here.’’ I mean, the fact of the matter is that you, as far as I can see, have always done your utmost to live up to your responsibilities as a Federal court judge and that you have done so throughout your 15 years on the bench, even though members of this illustrious body, the United State Senate, might differ with you on occasion, and others might also. But I don’t know a judge alive who has been on the bench 15 years that does not have cases that some of our illustrious members disagree with. So that is the point I am trying to make.
Let me just shift here for a second. I am interested in exploring the kind of judge you are. As you can see, some of these questions have all been directed toward what kind of a judge you are. But I am interested in what is often referred to as a judicial philosophy, which means how you understand the role that judges play in our system of Government in general and how judges should go about deciding cases in particular.
I would like to explore this by giving you a chance to expand on a few things that you have said or written. In your hearing in April 1990, which my friend Senator Kennedy chaired, he asked you what qualities are most important for an appellate judge. You listed open-mindedness to litigants’ arguments, close attention to the particular facts and law in the case, and trying not to import a judge’s own view of the law that should be applied in the case.
Now, in your statement yesterday, you said that your experience on the appeals court has taught you a lot about, as you put it, ‘‘the way in which a judge should go about the work of judging.’’ What has that experience taught you? How has it shaped the answer you gave before you went on the bench?
Judge ALITO. My general philosophy is that the judiciary has a very important role to play, and in speaking with Senator Leahy, I highlighted some of that. But the judiciary has to protect rights, and it should be vigorous in doing that, and it should be vigorous in enforcing the law and in interpreting the law, in interpreting the
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00353 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

342
law in accordance with what it really means and enforcing the law even if that’s unpopular.
But although the judiciary has a very important role to play, it’s a limited role. It is not—it should always be asking itself whether it is straying over the bounds, whether it’s invading the authority of the legislature, for example, whether it is making policy judgments rather than interpreting the law. And that has to be a constant process of re-examination on the part of the judges. And that’s the role that the judiciary should play.
Now, my experience on the bench has really reinforced for me the importance of the appellate process and the judicial process that I described yesterday. And that is the process of really engaging the arguments that are made, reading the briefs, and approaching it with an open mind, always with the possibility of changing your mind based on the arguments and based on the facts of a particular case.
Senator HATCH. Well, another context in which you have discussed your judicial philosophy is the questionnaire that you received from this Committee, which asked for your views on judicial activism. Now, the very first words of your answer were as given here today, that the Constitution sets forth the limited role for the judicial branch.
Now, to hear some of my colleagues describe it yesterday, judges have virtually unlimited power to right all wrongs, protect everyone from everything, and make sure that Government officials everywhere behave themselves.
Now, as an appeals court judge, the decisions of the Supreme Court add to the limitations or constraints you must observe, in my opinion. I am wondering whether you believe this notion of limited judicial power applies also the Supreme Court, and if so, how it applies when there is no higher court than the Supreme Court. Does that mean that the Supreme Court should perhaps be even more cautious, even more self-restrained since there is no appeal from any errors that they might make?
Judge ALITO. I think that’s a solemn responsibility that they have. When you know that you are the Court of last resort, you have to make sure that you get it right.
It is not true, in my judgment, that the Supreme Court is free to do anything that it wants. It has to follow the Constitution, and it has to follow the laws. Stare decisis, which I was talking about earlier, is an important limitation on what the Supreme Court does. And although the Supreme Court has the power to overrule a prior precedent, it uses that power sparingly, and rightfully so. It should be limited in what it does.
Senator HATCH. Another place in which you have written about what might be called judicial philosophy is in your opinions—not that you have spent much time opining about such matters in the abstract. Nevertheless, I would like you to expand a little on a few of the things you have written in this regard.
For instance, in New Jersey Payphone Association v. Town of West New York—this was a 2002 case—for example, you wrote the following: ‘‘It is well established that, when possible, Federal courts should generally base their decisions on non-constitutional rather than constitutional grounds. The rationale behind the doctrine of

343
avoiding constitutional questions except as a last resort are grounded in fundamental constitutional principles.’’
Can you explain those fundamental principles and whether you think the Supreme Court as well as the appeals court should follow this imperative to avoid constitutional decisions?
Judge ALITO. I do. I think that’s a very important principle. As I recall, Justice Brandeis in the Ashwander case was the one who articulated it most eloquently, and it’s, therefore, an important reason because a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court has a permanency that a decision on an issue of statutory interpretation doesn’t have. So if a case is decided on statutory grounds, there’s a possibility of Congress amending the statute to correct the decision if it’s perceived that the decision is incorrect or it’s producing undesirable results.
I think that it’s—my philosophy of the way I approach issues is to try to make sure that I get right what I decide, and that counsels in favor of not trying to do too much, not trying to decide questions that are too broad, not trying to decide questions that don’t have to be decided, and not going to broader grounds for a decision when a narrower ground is available.
Senator HATCH. You have addressed issues such as abortion at different points in your career. You addressed it when you worked for the Solicitor General. You might have addressed it in several cases on the appeals court. It might be tempting to say that if you came to one conclusion while in one role, you will necessarily come to the same conclusion on the issue while in a different role.
Now, I think you have explained it pretty well today, but let me just ask one other question. Could you please explain how judges address issues differently than advocates? And how does the requirement of a case or a controversy or a limitation such as a particular standard of review shape how judges address these issues?
Judge ALITO. The standards of review are very important, and often they are prescribed by Congress. Congress gives us authority, jurisdiction to decide certain questions, but it says that you don’t have the authority to go back and do what the trial—what you would have done if you were the trial judge or if you were the administrative agency; you have a limited authority of review. And I think it’s very important for us to stay within the bounds of the authority that Congress gives us. I think that’s a very important part of our function.
Senator HATCH. Thank you, Judge. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. We will now take a 15-minute break and reconvene at 11:20. [Recess at 11:06 a.m. to 11:20 a.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will continue the hearing for Judge Alito on confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States, and we now turn in sequence to Senator Kennedy. Let us not forget to start the clock. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. There was one interesting omission between the exchange of yourself and Senator Hatch on the whole Vanguard issue in question, and that was the promise and pledge that you gave to this Committee when you were up for the Circuit Court. I have it right here. It said: I do not believe that conflicts of interest relating to

my financial interests are likely to arise. I would, however, disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard Companies, the brokerage firm of Smith Barney or the First Federal Savings & Loan of Rochester, New York. So you remember that response. That was a pledge and promise to the Committee that you would recuse yourself, was it not?
Judge ALITO. Yes, it was, Senator. And as I said in answering Senator Hatch’s question, if I had it to do over again, I would have handled this case differently. There were some oversights—
Senator KENNEDY. I am sure you might have, and we have had a number of different explanations for this. I would like to ask the clerk if they would take down and show the Judge, if you would like to be refreshed, about the number of times the name Vanguard appears on the brief, and the number of times Vanguard appears on the opinion, which I believe you offer. I would ask if I could get a clerk to show those two documents.
Judge ALITO. Senator, I’m familiar with that. I don’t really need to see the document. Senator, the name Vanguard certainly appears on the briefs, and it appeared in the draft opinion that was sent to us by the staff attorney’s office. I just didn’t focus on the issue of recusal when it came up, and that was an oversight on my part, because it didn’t give me the opportunity to apply my personal policy in going beyond what the code requires.
Senator KENNEDY. Did the individuals that responded on the ethical issues that were involved in this case, did they know that you had pledged and promised to this Committee that you would recuse yourself?
Judge ALITO. I believe that they did. I believe that some of them at least addressed that specifically—
Senator KENNEDY. Do you know specifically whether they did or not?
Judge ALITO. I believe they addressed it in their letter, so they must have been aware of it.
Senator KENNEDY. They understood that you had promised this Committee that you would recuse yourself? Your testimony now is that those that made a comment upon your ethical behavior knew as a matter of fact that you had pledged to this Committee that you would recuse yourself from the Vanguard cases?
Judge ALITO. Professor Hazard, I know, addressed that directly in his letter. I think Professor Rotunda addressed it in his letter, so, obviously, if the letters addressed the issue, they were aware of what was said on the Senate questionnaire.
Senator KENNEDY. And the final answer—and we will move on— is that you saw the name Vanguard on the briefs, and you, obviously, saw them on the opinion. You are the author of the opinion. But your testimony here now is even though you saw the names on that, it did not come to mind at that moment that you had made the pledge and promise to this Committee that you would recuse yourself?
Judge ALITO. I did not focus on the issue of recusal I think because 12 years had gone by, and the issue of a Vanguard recusal hadn’t come up. And one of the reasons why judges tend to invest in mutual funds is because they generally don’t present recusal problems, and pro se cases in particular generally don’t present

345
recusal problems. And so, no light went off. That’s all I can say. I didn’t focus on the issue of recusal.
Senator KENNEDY. This is important, when the lights do go on and when the lights do go off, because, actually, the accumulation of value of Vanguard had increased dramatically during this period of time, had it not?
Judge ALITO. It had, Senator, but I had nothing to gain financially by—
Senator KENNEDY. I am not asking you to get on to the questions of gain or loss or whatever. I am just asking about the pledge to the Committee which you had given, and the fact that Vanguard was so obvious, both in the brief and in the opinion which you wrote, and the fact that during this period of time there had been a sizable increase in the total value of Vanguard, and as all of us know, if you are dealing with a case dealing with IBM, you cannot have even a single share in that. The point about all of this is so interested parties that have come before the courts, are going to believe not only in reality, but in appearance that they are going to get a fair shake. And that, you have said, was certainly your desire, and I certainly commend you for at least that desire. But in this case, this was something that we recognize and is extremely important.
Judge, in just the past month, Americans have learned that the President instructed the National Security Agency to spy on them at home, and they have seen an intense public debate over when the FBI can look at their library records, and they have heard the President announce that he has accepted the McCain amendment barring torture. But then just days later, as he signed it into law, the President decided he still could order torture whenever he believed it was necessary. No check, no balance, no independent oversight. So, Judge, we all want to protect our communities from terrorists, but we do not want our children and grandchildren to live in an America that accepts torture and eavesdropping on an American citizen as a way of life. We need an independent and vigilant Supreme Court to keep that from happening, to enforce the constitutional boundaries on Presidential power and blow the whistle when the President goes too far.
Congress passes laws, but this President says that he has the sole power to decide whether or not he has to obey those laws. Is that proper? I do not think so. But we need Justices who can examine this issue objectively, independently and fairly, and that is what our Founders intended and what the American people deserve.
So, Judge, we must know whether you can be a Justice who understands how to strike that proper balance between protecting our liberties and protecting our security, a Justice who will check even the President of the United States when he has gone too far.
Chief Justice Marshall was that kind of Justice when he told President Jefferson that he had exceeded his war-making powers under the Constitution. Justice Jackson was that kind of Justice when he told President Truman that he could not use the Korean War as an excuse to take over the Nation’s steel mills. Chief Justice Warren Burger was that kind of Justice when he told President Nixon to turn over the White House tapes. And Justice O’Con-

346
nor was that kind of Justice when she told President Bush that a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens.
I have serious doubts that you would be that kind of Justice. Your record shows time and again that you have been overly deferential to Executive power, whether exercised by the President, the Attorney General or law enforcement officials. And your record shows that even over the strong objections of other Federal judges, other Federal judges, you bend over backwards to find even the most aggressive exercise of Executive power reasonable. But perhaps most disturbing is the almost total disregard in your record for the impact of these abuses of power on the rights and liberties of individual citizens.
So, Judge Alito, we need to know whether the average citizen can get a fair shake from you when the Government is a party, and whether you will stand up to a President, any President, who ignores the Constitution and uses arguments of national security to expand Executive power at the expense of individual liberty, whether you will ever be able to conclude that the President has gone too far.
Now, in 1985, in your job application to the Justice Department you wrote, ‘‘I believe very strongly in the supremacy of the elected branches of Government.’’ Those are your words; am I right?
Judge ALITO. They are, and that’s a very inapt phrase, and I— Senator KENNEDY. Excuse me? Judge ALITO. It’s an inapt phrase, and I certainly didn’t mean that literally at the time, and I wouldn’t say that today. The branches of Government are equal. They have different responsibilities, but they are all equal, and no branch is supreme to the other branch. Senator KENNEDY. So you have changed your mind? Judge ALITO. No, I haven’t changed my mind, Senator, but the phrasing there is very misleading and incorrect. I think what I was getting at is the fact that our Constitution gives the judiciary a particular role, and there are instances in which it can override the judgments that are made by Congress and by the Executive, but for the most part our Constitution leaves it to the elected branches of Government to make the policy decisions for our country. Senator KENNEDY. I want to move on. Mr. Chairman, the clock is off. There are a number of points I want to cover and be timely, so I leave it up to the Chair. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kennedy, you are correct. We have a timer over here. We are trying to get the time fixed. Senator KENNEDY. All right. If I would know when I have 10 minutes left? Chairman SPECTER. Let us see if we cannot get the clock within the view of Senator Kennedy so he can see it when he is questioning the witness. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Chair. Chairman SPECTER. And give Senator Kennedy two more minutes. Senator KENNEDY. There you go. [Laughter.] Senator KENNEDY. Be quiet over there, scurrilous dogs.

[Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. Seniority has privileges. Senator KENNEDY. Judge, quite frankly, your record shows you still believe in the supremacy of the executive branch, Judge Alito. I believe there is a larger pattern in your writings and speeches and cases that show an excess of almost single-minded deference to the Executive power without showing a balanced consideration to the individual rights of people. So let us discuss some of your opinions. These cases deal specifically with one form or another of Executive power, the power of authorities intruding in homes, searching people who are not even suspected of committing a crime. Mellott v. Heemer—where the U.S. Marshal Service forcibly evicted a family of dairy farmers from their home and their farm. These farmers had no criminal record, and were suspected of no crime, but after they fell on very hard times, property was sold at a public auction. U.S. Marshals were sent to evict them. Remember, the marshals were sent to carry out a civil action, not a criminal action, a civil action. These farmers had committed no crime. Now, I respect the U.S. Marshals. They have a tough job and they do it with great professionalism. But in this case the marshals entered the house with loaded guns. The family was unarmed, did not resist, but still the marshals pointed loaded guns at their heads, chests and backs. One marshal chambered a cartridge in his gun. Twice they pushed the wife into her chair. The trial judge held there was enough evidence in this case to have a jury review the facts, hear the testimony and decide whether the marshals used too much force to evict these farmers. That did not sit well with you, Judge Alito. You grabbed the case away from the jury. You would not let them hear the testimony or make up their own mind about whether the marshals had gone too far. No, you simply substituted your judgment for the jury’s, and decided that the marshals’ conduct was, as a matter of law, objectively reasonable. Judgment for the marshals, no jury of their peers for the farmers. Why, Judge Alito? Your colleague on the Third Circuit, Judge Rendell, called the marshals’ conduct ‘‘Gestapo-like’’, ‘‘Gestapolike’’. She said that seven marshals terrorized a family and friends, ransacked a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction. The trial judge thought the decision should be made by the jury. Why did you not let the jury exercise an independent check on the marshals’ actions? Judge ALITO. There was some additional information regarding these people that was important, and that was that they had threatened other people, as I recall, and there was evidence about the possession of weapons and evidence that they would be dangerous, and that was the basis on which the marshals acted the way they did. This was a case in which they were—the marshals were sued for civil damages, and they asserted what’s called the Qualified Immunity Defense, and that means that if a reasonable person could have thought there was a basis for doing what they did, then they are entitled not to be tried. And that’s the law. I didn’t make up that law. Senator KENNEDY. No, the—

Chairman SPECTER. Let him finish, Senator Kennedy. Judge ALITO. That’s not a legal standard that I made up, and that was the way I saw the case, and that’s the way the other judge, who was in the majority, saw the case. Now, these cases involve difficult line-drawing arguments at times, and I respect Judge Rendell’s view of this very much, but reasonable people will view these things differently. Senator KENNEDY. The issue then was the actions of the marshals, whether it was reasonable. And here you have a judge, Judge Rendell, saying it was Gestapo-like to talk about terrorizing a family and friends, ransacking a home while carrying out an unresisted civil eviction. Aren’t juries there to make a judgment and determination whether it was reasonable or not reasonable, and did you not, by your action, take that away because you ruled as a matter of law that their conduct was reasonable? Judge ALITO. The Supreme Court has told us how we have to handle this issue, and it is for the judiciary to decide in the first place whether a reasonable officer could have thought that what the officer was doing was consistent with the Fourth Amendment, and we have to make that decision. Now, if we decide that there’s an issue of fact. If there’s a dispute in the testimony about the evidence that the marshals had or about what these individuals were doing at the time when the search was taking place, or what the marshals did, and certainly those factual issues have to be resolved by the jury. Senator KENNEDY. That is I think certainly the view of Judge Rendell. Let me move on, if I could, to Doe v. Groody. I know that Senator Leahy has talked about this, and gone over the factual situation about the strip searching of a 10-year-old girl. This case, the police got the warrant to search the house. They found the suspect outside, marched him inside where they encountered wife and 10-yearold. The police took the wife and daughter upstairs, told them to remove their clothing, physically searched them, not as a protective frisk or search for weapons, but in the hopes of finding contraband. And that is when Judge Chertoff, the former Chief Federal Prosecutor for New Jersey, the former head of the Criminal Division in the Justice Department, President Bush’s current Secretary of Homeland Security, held that the police went too far. As Judge Chertoff said, a search warrant for a premise does not constitute a license to search everyone inside. You differed. And you have reviewed with us your reasoning for it, the fact that you felt that the affidavit which had been filed by the police should be included in the search warrant. Judge Chertoff takes strong exception to that, as does the Fourth Amendment. As you mentioned yourself, the affidavit represents the police, the police’s view about this situation, but the affidavit—the search warrant is what is approved by the judge. Those are two different items. They come up every time in many, many instances. Why did you feel that under these circumstances, under these circumstances, that that affidavit should be included, the result of which we have the strip searching of a 10-year-old, 10-year-old that will bear the scars of that kind of activity probably for the rest of her life.

349
The Fourth Amendment is clear, we want to protect the innocent. We want to have a search warrant that is precise so that the police understand it and the person that it is being served to understands it. That was all spelled out in the judge’s opinion. But you went further than that. You said, well, in this case we are going to include the affidavit, and as a result of your judgment in this case and the inclusion of the affidavit, we have the kind of conduct against this 10-year-old that she will never forget. Why? Why, Judge Alito?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I wasn’t happy that a 10-year-old was searched. Now, there wasn’t any claim in this case that the search was carried out in any sort of an abusive fashion. It was carried out by a female officer, and that wasn’t the issue in the case. And I don’t think that there should be a Fourth Amendment rule. But, of course, it’s not up to me to decide that minors can never be searched, because if we had a rule like that, then where would drug dealers hide their drugs? That would lead to greater abuse of minors.
The technical issue in the case was really not whether a warrant can incorporate a search warrant—an affidavit. There’s no dispute that a judge or a magistrate issuing a warrant can say that the affidavit is incorporated, and that was done here. The issue was whether—and it was a very technical issue. Was it incorporated only on the issue of probable cause or was it also incorporated on the issue of who would be searched? If the magistrate had said in the warrant, this warrant is incorporated as to the people who may be searched, and then in the affidavit it said, and it did say this very clearly, we want authorization to search anybody who’s on the premises, then there would be no problem whatsoever.
The warrant said it was incorporated on the issue of probable cause, and I thought that reading it in a common sense fashion, which is what we’re supposed to do, that necessarily meant that the magistrate said there was probable cause to search anybody who’s found on the premises and that’s what I’m authorizing you to do.
Senator KENNEDY. And that is what Judge Chertoff took strong exception, in a very eloquent statement in talking about the protections and the reasons for the strict interpretation for the warrant. Let me move on.
Judge Alito, your Third Circuit decisions don’t exist in a vacuum. I’d like to, Mr. Chairman, at this point, since there have been some questions about whether we are flyspecking these cases, I would like to include in the appropriate place in the record the Knight Ridder studies that concluded that Judge Alito never found a government search unconstitutional; the Yale Law School professors study that found that Judge Alito ruled for the government in almost every case reviewed—this was their conclusion; the Washington Post stories with regard to the cases; and also Professor Cass Sunstein’s conclusions that Judge Alito rules against individuals 84 percent of the time.
Chairman SPECTER. In accordance with our practices, if you want them in the record, they will be there, without objection.
Senator KENNEDY. So just looking at your writings and speeches, Judge Alito, you have endorsed the supremacy of the elected

branch of government. You have clarified that today. You argued that the Attorney General should have absolute immunity, even for actions that he knows to be unlawful or unconstitutional. You suggested that the Court should give a President’s signing statement great deference in determining the meaning and the intent of the law and argued as a matter of your own political and judicial philosophy for an almost all-powerful Presidency. Time and again, even in routine matters involving average Americans, you give enormous, almost total deference to the exercise of governmental power. So I want to ask you about some of the possible abuses of the Executive power and infringement on individual rights that we are facing in the country today.
Judge Alito, just a few weeks ago, by a vote of 90 to nine, the Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Senator John McCain to ban torture, whether it be here at home or abroad, and as a former POW in Vietnam, John McCain knows a thing or two about torture. For a long time, the White House threatened to veto the legislation, and finally, Senator McCain met with the President and convinced him to approve the anti-torture law. Two weeks after that, the President issued a signing statement, no publicity, no press release, no photo op, where he quietly gutted his commitment to enforce the law banning torture. The President stated, in essence, that whatever the law of the land might be, whatever Congress might have written, the Executive branch has the right to authorize torture without fear of judicial review.
Now, I raise this issue with you, Judge, I raise this with you because you were among the early advocates of these so-called Presidential signing statements when you were a Justice Department official. You urged President Reagan to use the signing statements to limit the scope of laws passed by Congress, even though Article I of the Constitution vests all legislative powers in the Congress. You urged the President to adopt what you described as a novel proposal, to issue statements aimed at undermining the Court’s use of legislative history as a guide to the meaning of the law. You wrote these words. The President’s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress.
With respect to the statement issued by President Bush reserving his right to order torture, is that what you had in mind when you said or wrote, the President’s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress?
Judge ALITO. When I interpret statutes, and that’s something that I do with some frequency on the Court of Appeals, where I start and often where I end is with the text of the statute. And if you do that, I think you eliminate a lot of problems involving legislative history and also with signing statements. So I think that’s the first point that I would make.
Now, I don’t say I’m never going to look at legislative history, and the role of signing statements in the interpretation of statutes is, I think, a territory that’s been unexplored by the Supreme Court and it certainly is not something that I have dealt with as a judge.
This memo was a memo that resulted from a working group meeting that I attended. The Attorney General had already decided that as a matter of policy, the administration, the Reagan administration, would issue signing statements for interpretive purposes

and had made an arrangement with the West Publishing Company to have those published. And my task from this meeting was to summarize where the working group was going and where it had been, and I said at the beginning of the meeting that this was a rough—at the beginning of the memo that this was a rough first effort to outline what the administration was planning to do and I was a lawyer for the administration at the time. Then I had a big section of that memo saying, and these are the theoretical problems and some of them are the ones that you mentioned. And that’s where I left it, and all of that would need to be explored to go any further.
Senator KENNEDY. Well, Judge Alito, in the same signing statement undermining the McCain anti-torture law, the President referred to his authority to supervise the unitary Executive branch. That’s an unfamiliar term to most Americans, but the Wall Street Journal describes it as the foundation of the Bush administration’s assertion of power to determine the fate of enemy prisoners, jailing U.S. citizens as enemy combatants without charging them. President Bush has referred to this doctrine at least 110 times, while Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush combined used the term only seven times. President Clinton never used it.
Judge Alito, the Wall Street Journal reports that officials of the Bush administration are concerned that current judges are not buying into its unitary Executive theory, so they are appointing new judges more sympathetic to their Executive power claims. We need to know whether you are one of those judges.
In 2000, in the year 2000, in a speech soon after the election, you referred to the unitary Executive theory as the gospel and affirmed your belief in it. So, Judge Alito, the President is saying he can ignore the ban on torture passed by Congress, that the courts cannot review his conduct. In light of your lengthy record on the issues of Executive power, deferring to the conduct of law enforcement officials even when they are engaged in conduct that your judicial colleagues condemn, Judge Chertoff, Judge Rendell, subscribing to the theory of unitary Executive, which gives the President complete power over the independent agencies, the independent agencies that protect our health and safety, believing that the true independent special prosecutors who investigate Executive wrongdoing are unconstitutional, referring to the supremacy of the elected branches over the judicial branch and arguing that the court should give equal weight to a President’s view about the meaning of the laws that Congress has passed, why should we believe that you will act as an independent check on the President when he claims the power to ignore the laws passed by Congress?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, let me explain what I understand the idea of the unitary Executive to be, and I think it’s—there’s been some misunderstanding, at least as to what I understand this concept to mean. I think it’s important to draw a distinction between two very different ideas. One is the scope of Executive power, and often Presidents or occasionally Presidents have asserted inherent Executive powers not set out in the Constitution. And we might think of that as how big is this table, the extent of Executive power.
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00363 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

352
And the second question is when you have a power that is within the prerogative of the Executive, who controls the Executive? And those are separate questions. And the issue of, to my mind, the concept of unitary Executive doesn’t have to do with the scope of Executive power. It has to do with who within the Executive branch controls the exercise of Executive power, and the theory is the Constitution says the Executive power is conferred on the President.
Now, the power that I was addressing in that speech was the power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not some inherent power but a power that is explicitly set out in the Constitution.
Senator KENNEDY. Would that have any effect or impact on independent agencies?
Judge ALITO. The status of independent agencies, I think, is now settled in the case law. This was addressed in Humphrey’s Executor way back in 1935 when the Supreme Court said that the structure of the Federal Trade Commission didn’t violate the separation of powers. And then it was revisited and reaffirmed in Wiener v. United States in 1958—
Senator KENNEDY. So your understanding of any unitary Presidency, that they do not therefore have any kind of additional kind of control over the independent agencies that has been agreed to by the Congress and signed into law at—
Judge ALITO. I think that Humphrey’s Executor is a well-settled precedent. What the unitary Executive, I think, means now, we would look to Morrison, I think, for the best expression of it, and it is that things cannot be arranged in such a way that interfere with the President’s exercise of his power on a functional, taking a functional approach.
Senator KENNEDY. I want to just mention this signing of the understanding of the legislation that we passed banning torture, what the President signed on to. The Executive branch shall construe the Title X in Division A relating to detainees in a matter with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary Executive branch as the commander in chief, and consistent with the constitutional limitations on judicial power. Therefore, it is the warning that the courts are not going to be able to override the judgments and decisions. That is certainly my understanding of those words, which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the President.
That statement there, in terms of what was agreed to by Congress 90-to-9, by John McCain, by President Bush, and then we have this signing document which effectively just undermines all of that, is something that we have to ask ourselves whether this is the way that we understand the way the laws are to be made. It is very clear in the Constitution who makes the laws, and Congress and the Senate makes it. The President signs it, and that is the law. That is the law. These signing statements and recognizing these signing statements and giving these value in order to basically undermine that whole process is a matter of enormous concern.
Thank you.

Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, Senator Kennedy had noted that there were substantial gains, as he put it, in the Vanguard stock or the Vanguard asset during the period of time that you held them, but he did not give you an opportunity to answer that. I don’t like to interrupt in the midst of a series of questions, but you can respond to that if you care to do so at this time.
Judge ALITO. Mr. Chairman, I had additional holdings in Vanguard during my period of service, but I think that the important point as far as that is concerned is that nobody has claimed that I had anything to gain financially from participating in this case and I certainly did not.
Chairman SPECTER. Senator Grassley? Senator GRASSLEY. I have a much more positive view of you than has just been expressed. [Laughter.] Senator GRASSLEY. I can’t be cynical about your judging. In fact, maybe from what I have criticized the Supreme Court in a long period of time, I might feel you are too cautious, too willing to follow precedent. But I think in regard to Vanguard, the point ought to be made that you did nothing wrong. You didn’t violate any law or any ethics rule. And the point is being made that maybe you didn’t remember a promise that you had made to this Committee, but let me assure you, don’t lose any sleep over that. If Senators kept every word they made to their constituents, there wouldn’t be any Senators left. There is always shortness of memory and without ill intent, whether it is on the part of a Senator or whether it is on the part of Judge Alito. I hope the viewing public is impressed by your intellect and your legal capabilities and your judicial record. Clearly, they are seeing that you have the kind of background and practical experience that it takes to be a Supreme Court Justice. In addition, I think you have demonstrated now after five or six of us asking you questions that you are very candid in answering questions so far and being honest with our Committee. These nomination hearings that we are holding are, of course, a unique opportunity for all of us, Senators and the public, to explore more in depth how Supreme Court nominees view the roles of justice, how a nominee approaches constitutional interpretation and precedent, as well as a nominee’s appreciation of the separate branches of government, and you have been involved in all of those discussions already this morning. It is unfortunate that some extreme liberal groups have attacked your commitment to the law as well as your honesty and integrity, but now you are doing your best, and I think doing a good job, of setting the record straight. So before I ask you some questions, I want to bring up some of these issues that have been brought up against you, and you don’t necessarily have to respond in any way. I just think it is points that ought to be made as I see you. I am only one Senator, but I think I have had a good opportunity to study you and particularly your cases. I would like to address these ethics charges that we have seen generated by some of the left-wing liberal interest groups and even my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. These allegations are
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00365 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

354
just plain absurd. You are going to see some charts that hopefully will be held up that I am not going to point to, but bring up some of these charges, because I think we want to prove that these allegations are absurd. It is puzzling to me that anyone would actually believe these claims, especially when people who know Judge Alito the best, people who have known him for a long period of time and who have worked closely with him, better than any of our Senators would know you, they all say that you are a man of honor, integrity, and principle. They have no question about that.
The fact is that the ABA looks at issues such as integrity and ethics when it evaluates a judicial nominee and it found you, Judge Alito, to be unanimously well qualified, a rating that Democrats have always claimed to be a gold standard. The ABA didn’t find a problem with Judge Alito’s record.
Moreover, several leading ethicists from across the political spectrum reviewed these allegations and they all agreed that you, Judge Alito, acted properly and that none of these charges have merit. It says in a letter from George Mason University Law Professor Ronald Rotunda, already referred to by members, and in a letter to Chairman Specter, quote, ‘‘Neither Federal statute nor Federal rules nor Model Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association provide that a judge should disqualify himself in any case involving a mutual fund company,’’ and they give as examples Vanguard, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, ‘‘simply because a judge owns mutual funds that the company manages and holds in trust for a judge,’’ end of quote. So basically, according to law, Judge Alito was not required to recuse himself in the Vanguard case, but he did it anyway.
So let me repeat, five leading ethicists all say Judge Alito did nothing wrong. Professor Thomas Morgan, quote, ‘‘In my opinion, Judge Alito’s participation in the Vanguard case was in no way improper, nor does it give any reason to doubt that he would fully comply with his ethical responsibilities, if confirmed.’’
And Professor Steven Lubet and David McGowan wrote, ‘‘You do not need to be a fan of Alito’s jurisprudence to recognize that he is a man of integrity. Other judges and Justices would do well to follow this example,’’ end of quote.
In addition, no complaint filed against Judge Alito has ever been validated, and to top it off, we have heard glowing statement after glowing statement from folks closest to the Judge, your law clerks, Republicans and Democrats alike, as well as lawyers and judges who practiced before and worked with the Judge on a daily basis. These people know this nominee best and they all say that he is a man of humility, a man of principle, and they don’t have any question about the Judge’s integrity.
So it is patently unfair that some folks, intent on torpedoing this nomination, are trying to give these allegations weight that they don’t deserve. It should be clear to everyone that this is a blatant tactic to tar Judge Alito’s honorable and distinguished judicial record, and I hope this puts to rest these outrageous claims that Judge Alito doesn’t have the integrity to be a Supreme Court Justice. It is outlandish and should be rejected.
I am now getting to a question that I want to ask you about Executive power. Some of your critics have questioned your ability,

and we have just heard it recently, to be independent from the Executive branch. They pointed principally to your work as a lawyer for the Department of Justice 20 years ago, suggesting that you would just rubber-stamp administration policy. I would like to give you an opportunity to address this. So, Judge Alito, do you believe that the Executive branch should have unchecked authority?
Judge ALITO. Absolutely not, Senator. Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Alito, you do understand that under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Supreme Court has an obligation to make sure that each branch of government does not coopt authority reserved to the coordinate branch, and do you understand that where constitutionally protected rights are involved, the courts have an important role to play in making sure that the Executive branch does not trample those rights? Judge ALITO. I certainly do, Senator. Each branch has very important individual responsibilities and they should all perform their responsibilities. Senator GRASSLEY. So clarify for me. Do you believe that the President of the United States is above the law and the Constitution? Judge ALITO. Nobody in this country is above the law, and that includes the President. Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Alito, would you have any difficulty ruling against the Executive branch of the Federal Government if it were to overstep its authority in the Constitution? Judge ALITO. I would not, Senator. I would judge the cases as they come up and I think that I believe very strongly in the independence of the judiciary. I have been a member of the judiciary now for the past 15-and-a-half years and I understand the role that the judiciary has to play, and one of its most important roles is to stand up and defend the rights of people when they are violated. Senator GRASSLEY. This first question is very general. It is a new area. I would like to explore in detail what you understand to be the proper role of a judge in a democratic society. So could you generally give me what your views are on this approach? Judge ALITO. Yes. Our Constitution sets up a system of government that is democratic. So the basic policy decisions are made by people who are elected by the people so that the people can control their own destiny. But the Constitution establishes certain principles that can’t be violated by the Executive branch or by the legislative branch. It sets up a structure of government that everybody has to follow and it protects fundamental rights. And it is the job of the judiciary to enforce the provisions of the Constitution and to enforce the laws that are enacted by Congress in accordance with the meaning that Congress attached to those laws, not to try to change the Constitution, not to try to change the laws, but to be vigilant in enforcing the Constitution and in enforcing the laws. Senator GRASSLEY. What do you think about judges allowing their own political and philosophical views to impact on any jurisprudence? Second, do you believe that there is any room for a judge’s own value or personal beliefs when he or she interprets the Constitution? Judge ALITO. Judges have to be careful not to inject their own views into the interpretation of the Constitution, and for that mat-

ter, into the interpretation of statutes. That is not the job that we are given. That is not authority that we are given. Congress has the law-making authority. You have the authority to make the policy decisions and it’s the job of the judiciary to carry out the policy decisions that are made by Congress when it’s enacting statutes.
Senator GRASSLEY. Further explanation on that point, three subparts. Do you believe that Justices should consider political dimensions of controversial cases? Do you believe that when faced with hard cases, the Supreme Court should look at pleasing the home crowd or splitting the baby? And what is the proper role of the Supreme Court in deciding highly charged cases, meaning, I suppose in most cases, we would be talking about politically charged cases?
Judge ALITO. The Framers of the Constitution made a basic decision when they set up the Federal judiciary the way they set up it, and there’s a reason why they gave Federal judges life tenure, and that is so that they will be insulated from all of the things that you mentioned. They will not decide cases based on the way the wind is blowing at a particular time, that at a time of crisis, for example, when people may lose sight of fundamental rights, the judiciary stands up for fundamental rights, that it is not reluctant to stand up for the unpopular and for what the Court termed insular minorities, that the Constitution—that the judiciary enforces the Constitution and the laws in a steadfast way and not in accordance with the way the wind is blowing.
Senator GRASSLEY. Let us look at the Bill of Rights and many other amendments that are often praised in broad, spacious terms. If a judge was so inclined, he or she could expand on the interpretation, use, and effect of many provisions of the Constitution. Do you agree with the school of thought that takes the position that when Congress and the Executive branch are slow or do not act in a particular manner, act at all, let us say, then the Supreme Court would have a license to create solutions based on some of the broad wording contained in the Constitution? Do you think that this is a proper role for the Supreme Court, or do you take the position that judges have a duty to respect constitutional restraints?
Judge ALITO. Judges have to respect constitutional restraints. They have to exercise what’s called judicial self-restraint because there aren’t very many external checks on the judiciary on a dayto-day basis. So the judiciary has to restrain itself and engage in a constant process of asking itself, is this something that we are supposed to be doing or are we stepping over the line and invading the area that is left to the legislative branch, for example. The judiciary has to engage in that on a constant basis.
Senator GRASSLEY. Well, just suppose that Congress had not even acted in a certain area and there are people that are bringing cases before the court that would give an opportunity to fill in on something that Congress didn’t do. What about in—
Judge ALITO. The judiciary is not a law-making body. Congress is the law-making body. Congress has the legislative power and the judiciary has to perform its role and not try to perform the role of Congress or the Executive.
Senator GRASSLEY. I don’t know whether you have ever had a case where the Framers—where you are dealing with the problems that the Framers maybe in broad ways in the Constitution couldn’t

provide for, but how would you apply the words of the Constitution into problems that the Framers could not have foreseen?
Judge ALITO. There are very important provisions of the Constitution that are not cast in specific terms, and I think for good reason. They set out a principle, and then it is up to the judiciary to apply that principle to the facts that arise during different periods in the history of our country.
The example that I like to cite here is the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures in the Fourth Amendment. Now, this goes all the way back to the adoption of the Fourth Amendment at the end of the 18th century and most of the types of searches that come up today are things that the Framers never could have anticipated. They couldn’t foresee automobiles or telephones or cell phones or the Internet or any of the other means of communication that have prevented new search and seizure issues. But they set out a good principle, and the principle is that searches can’t be carried out unless they’re reasonable, and generally, there has to be a warrant issued by a neutral and detached magistrate before a search can be carried out.
And so as these new types of searches have arisen and new means of communication have come into practice, the judiciary has applied this principle and the legislative branch has applied the principle in statutes like the wiretapping statute to the new situations that have come up.
Senator GRASSLEY. What factors, if any, and there may not be any, but what factors, if any, are there which can affect a judge’s interpretation of the text of the Constitution? Can these factors be determined and applied without involving personal bias of judges?
Judge ALITO. I think they can. There would be no, I think, basis for judges to exercise the power of judicial review if they were doing nothing different from what the legislature does in passing statutes. So judges have to look to objective things, and if it’s a question of absolutely first impression, and there aren’t that many constitutional issues that arise at this point in our history that are completely issues of first impression, you would look to the text of the Constitution and you would look to anything that would shed light on the way in which the provision would have been understood by people reading it at the time.
You certainly would look to precedent, which is an objective factor, and most of the issues that come up in constitutional law now fall within an area in which there is a rich and often very complex body of doctrine that has worked out. Search and seizure is an example. Most of the issues that arise concerning—freedom of speech is another example. There is a whole body of doctrine dealing with that, and that’s objective and you would look to that and you would reason by analogy from the precedents that are in existence.
Senator GRASSLEY. Let me bring up the tension between majority rule and individual freedoms. This involves the tensions between the American ideal of democratic rule and the concept of individual liberties, where neither the majority nor the minority can be fully trusted to define the proper spheres of our democratic authority and liberty. I assume that you agree that there is tension that has to be resolved?

Judge ALITO. There is tension because our system of government is fundamentally a democratic system, as I said. The authority to make the basic policy decisions that affect people’s lives, most of them, most of those decisions are to be made by the legislature and by the Executive in carrying out the law. But the judiciary has the responsibility to exercise the power of judicial review. And so if something comes up that violates the Constitution, then it’s been established now going all the way back to Marbury v. Madison, if that comes up in a case, it is the duty of the judiciary to say what the law is and to enforce the law in that decision, and if that means saying that something that another branch of government has done is unconstitutional, then that’s what the judiciary has to do.
Senator GRASSLEY. How would you go about your duties as a Justice in determining where the right of the silent majority ends and where the right of the individual begins? What principles of constitutional interpretation help you to begin your analysis of whether a particular statute infringes upon some individual right?
Judge ALITO. I would look to the text of the provision. I would look to anything that sheds light on what that would have been understood to mean. I would look to precedent, and as I mentioned a minute ago, I think in most of the areas now where constitutional issues come up with some frequency, there is a body of precedent. That would be—that shapes the decision. That’s generally what is going to dictate the outcome in the case, and if it’s a new question, then usually the judiciary will see where it fits into the body of precedent and reason by analogy from prior precedents.
Senator GRASSLEY. Some judges and scholars believe that in resolving this dilemma, the court’s obligation to the intent of the Constitution are so generalized and remote that judges are free to create a Constitution that they think best fits today’s changing society. What do you think of such an approach?
Judge ALITO. Judges don’t have the authority to change the Constitution. The whole theory of judicial review that we have, I think is contrary to that notion. The Constitution is an enduring document and the Constitution doesn’t change. It does contain some important general principles that have to be applied to new factual situations that come up. But in doing that, the judiciary has to be very careful not to inject its own views into the matter. It has to apply the principles that are in the Constitution to the situations that come before the judiciary.
Senator GRASSLEY. I think you heard in opening comments some of the members of this Committee that they view the courts as a place taking the lead in creating a more just society. Is that a role for the courts, and I don’t know whether you want to call this judicial activism, but I would, is it ever justified?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think that if the courts do the job that they are supposed to do, they will produce, we will produce a more just society. I think if you take a position as a Federal judge, you have to have faith that if you do your job, then you will be helping to create a more just society. The Constitution and the constitutional system that we have is designed to produce a just society.
It gives different responsibilities to different people. You could think of a football team or you could think of an orchestra where

359
everybody has a different part to play, and the whole system won’t work if people start playing—start performing the role of someone else. Everyone in the system has to perform their role, and I think you have to have faith, and I think it’s a well-grounded faith, that if you do that, if the judiciary does what it is supposed to do, the whole system will work toward producing a more just society.
Senator GRASSLEY. I want to go back and expand on a point I referred to as maybe Congress not acting some time and what the Court should do about that. This was a line of questioning that I also asked Chief Justice Roberts when he was before us. At that time, I referred to the confirmation of Justice Souter, and Justice Souter responded to my questions regarding the interpretation of statutory law by speaking about the Court’s filling vacuums in law left by Congress. Do you believe that the Supreme Court should fill in vacuums in the law left by Congress, or is this a way for Justices to take an activist role in that they get to decide how to fill in generalities and resolve contradictions in law? If you are confirmed by the Senate, do you believe that your job is to fill in vacuums?
Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t know exactly what Justice Souter was referring to when he said that, but just speaking for myself, I think that it is our job to interpret and to enforce the statutes that Congress passes and not to add to those statutes and not to take away from those statutes.
Senator GRASSLEY. Further on judicial restraint, are there any situations where you believe it is appropriate for a Supreme Court Justice to depart from the issue at hand and announce broad sweeping constitutional doctrine, and if you do, could you please describe in detail what those circumstances might be?
Judge ALITO. I think that the judiciary should decide the case— I think judges should decide the case that is before them. I think it’s hard enough to do that and get it right. If judges begin to go further and announce—and decide questions that aren’t before them, or issue opinions or statements about questions that aren’t before them—from my personal experience, what happens when you do that is that you magnify the chances of getting something wrong. When you have an actual concrete case of controversy before you, focus on that. It improves your ability to think through the issue and it focuses your thinking on the issue and it makes for a better decision if you just focus on the matter that is at hand and what you have to decide and not speak more broadly.
If you speak more broadly, I think there is a real chance of saying something that you don’t mean to say, or suggesting something that you don’t mean to say and deciding questions before they have been fully presented to you, before you have heard all the arguments about this other question that isn’t really central to the case that is before you.
Senator GRASSLEY. You might sometime be faced with what people might call a bad law or some unpopular law which nonetheless might be constitutional. Do you believe that—I guess the question should be, what do you believe would be the court’s role in that instance? Is the court ever justified in correcting what might be a problem out there, presumably created by a law Congress passed?

Judge ALITO. Courts do not have the authority to repeal statutes or to amend statutes, and so once a court has determined what a statute means, then it’s the obligation of the courts to enforce that statute. Now, sometimes when a case of statutory interpretation comes before a court and your first look at the statute seems to produce an absurd result, let’s say, or a very unjust result, then I think the judiciary has the obligation to go back and say, well, is this really what the statute means, because the legislature generally is not going to want to produce a result like that. So maybe our first look at this statute has produced an interpretation that’s it’s an incorrect statute. So I think we have to do that.
And occasionally, a statute will come along or an administrative regulation will come along and the way it’s applied in a particular case shows that there’s a problem with the statute or the regulation that maybe Congress didn’t anticipate or the administrative agency didn’t anticipate. And in those instances, while I think it is the obligation of the judiciary to apply the statute that is before the judiciary, I think it is proper for us to say, look, this shows how this statute or this regulation plays out in the real world in this situation and maybe you didn’t think about that and maybe that’s something that you want to take into account if you’re going to revise the statute or issue a new regulation. I think those are proper roles for us.
Senator GRASSLEY. What is your position regarding results-oriented jurisprudence, where the rationale is made secondary to the actual result reached? When, if ever, is results-oriented jurisprudence justified?
Judge ALITO. Results-oriented jurisprudence is never justified because it is not our job to try to produce particular results. We are not policymakers and we shouldn’t be implementing any sort of policy agenda or policy preferences that we have.
Senator GRASSLEY. In the past few decades, certain interest groups and legal scholars and even some Members of Congress have tried to convert the Supreme Court from a legal institution into political, social, and cultural ones. Because of this, the Court has morphed in that direction, I believe, becoming a battlefield for warring interest groups who are raising and spending millions of dollars on disinformation campaigns and website blogs. There are even blogs going on all the time about this hearing. Do you think it is because the Supreme Court has injected itself into policy issues better left to the elected branches of government, or has the Supreme Court tried to act as kind of a roving commission, attempting to solve perceived societal problems, or maybe it is none of the above? What do you think can be done to restore the sense of constitutional balance between the Supreme Court and the Executive and legislative branches of government and understanding all are co-equal?
Judge ALITO. I think the branches are co-equal and I think that the judiciary as a whole, including the Supreme Court, must always be mindful of the role that it is supposed to play in our system of government. It has an important role to play, but it’s a limited role and it has to do what it is supposed to do vigilantly, but it also has to be equally vigilant about not stepping over the bounds and invading the authority of Congress or invading the au-

Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Judge Alito. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Biden? Senator BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I understand, Judge, I am the only one standing between you and lunch, so I will try to make this painless. Judge, I would like to say a few very brief things at the outset. I am puzzled, and I suspect you may be puzzled by some of the questions. I don’t think anybody thinks you are a man lacking in integrity. I don’t think anybody thinks that you are a person who is not independent. I think that what people are wondering about and puzzled about is not whether you lack independence, but whether you independently conclude that the Executive trumps the other two branches. They wonder when you back—granted, it is back in 1985 or 1984 when you wrote, ‘‘I do not question the Attorney General should have this immunity, has absolute immunity. But for tactical reasons,’’ et cetera. So people are puzzled, at least some are puzzled, and so I don’t want you to read any of this, at least from my perspective, as I have read it so far, that people think that this is a bad guy. What people are puzzled about with the recusal issue was under oath you said, ‘‘I will recuse myself on anything relating to’’—and then a case comes up. So they are looking for an explanation. So it is not about whether you are profiting or whether you are, you know, all this malarkey about what you broke judicial ethics. It is a simple kind of thing. You know, you under oath said, ‘‘I promise if this ever comes up, I will recuse myself,’’ and then you gave an explanation. You know, it slipped, you forgot, it had been years earlier, et cetera. So don’t read it as, you know, this is one of these things where we know you are—the people I have spoken to on your court—and it is my circuit—have a very high regard for you, and I think you are a man of integrity. The question is sometimes some of the things you have said and done at least puzzle me. And I would like to—and one of the things—this is not part of the line of questioning I wanted to ask, but I did ask you when you were kind enough to come to my office about the Concerned Alumni of Princeton. Were you aware of some of the other things they were saying that had nothing to do with ROTC? Because there was a great deal of controversy. I mean, I can remember—I can remember this. My son was— well, anyway, he ended up going to that other university, the University of Pennsylvania. But I remember, you know, Princeton. I had spoken on campus in the early 1970s. This was a big thing, up at Princeton at the Woodrow Wilson School. And I remember— I didn’t remember Bill Frist, but I remember that there was this disavowing, that Bill Bradley, this great basketball star and now U.S. Senator, was, you know, disassociating himself with this outfit, that there was a magazine called Prospect. I remember the magazine. And all I want to ask is: Were you aware of the other things that this outfit was talking about? Were you aware of this controversy going on in 1972?

Judge ALITO. Senator, I don’t believe that I was, and when it was mentioned that Senator Bradley had withdrawn from a magazine, that didn’t ring any bells for me. I did not recall anything like that.
Senator BIDEN. It was a pretty outrageous group. I mean, I believe you that you were unaware of it, but here I was, University of Delaware graduate, a sitting U.S. Senator. I was aware of it because I was up there on the campus. I mean, it was a big deal. It was a big deal, at least in our area, the Delaware Valley, if you know Princeton, Penn, the schools around there had this kind of— because the big thing was going on at Brown at the time as well.
And, by the way, for the record, I know you know. When you stated in your application that you are a member—you said in 1985, ‘‘I am a member’’—they had restored ROTC. I mean, ROTC was back on the campus. But, again, this is just by way of, you know, why some of us are puzzled, because if I was aware of it and I didn’t even like Princeton.
[Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. No, I mean, I really didn’t like Princeton. I was an Irish Catholic kid who thought it hadn’t changed like you concluded it had. I mean, you know, I admit, I have a little—you know, one of my real dilemmas is I have two kids who went to Ivy League schools. I am not sure my Grandfather Finnegan will ever forgive me for allowing that to happen. But all kidding aside, I was not a big Princeton fan, and so maybe that is why I focused on it and no one else did. But I remember at the time. The other thing is, Judge, you know, the other thing you should be aware of—and kind of don’t take this personally what is going on here—every nominee who comes before us is viewed by all the Senators, left, right, center, Democrat, Republican, at least on two levels, at least in my experience here. One is, the first one, individual qualifications and what their constitutional methodology, their views are, their philosophy. But the other is—and it always occurs—whose spot they are taking and what impact that will have on the Court. Everybody wrote with Roberts after the fact—and a lot of people voted for Roberts that were doubtful. I was doubtful. I voted no. But he was replacing Rehnquist. So Roberts for Rehnquist, you know, what is the worst that can happen, quote-unquote, or the best that can happen? Now, I am not being facetious. What is the best or worst? If you are conservative, the best that can happen is he is as good as Rehnquist. From the standpoint of someone who is a liberal, the worst that can happen, he is as good as Rehnquist. So, I mean, but you are replacing—I mean, we can’t lose this, and so people understand this. You are replacing someone who has been the fulcrum on an otherwise evenly divided Court. And a woman who most scholars who write about her and in a retrospective about her say this is a woman who viewed things from—the phrase you have used—a real-world perspective. This was a former legislator. This was a former practitioner. This was someone who came to the bench and applied—to her critics, she applied too much common sense. Critics would say that she was too sensitive to the impact on individuals, you know, what would happen to an individual. So her focus on the impact on individuals was sometimes

criticized and praised. It is just important you understand, at least for my questioning, that this goes beyond you. It goes to whether or not your taking her seat will alter the constitutional framework of this country by shifting the balance, 5–4, 4–5, one way or another.
And that is the context in which at least I want to ask you my questions after trying to get some clarification or getting some clarification from you on Concerned Princeton—because, again, a lot of this just is puzzling, not able to be answered, just puzzling.
Judge, you and I both know—and clearly one of the hallmarks, at least in my view, of Justice O’Connor’s position was she fully understood the real world of discrimination. I mean, she felt it. Graduated No. 2 in her class from Stanford, could not get a job, was offered a job by law firms. Granted, she is a little older than you are, but could not get a job because she was a woman. They offered her a job as a secretary. And so she understood what I think everybody here from both ends of the spectrum here understand, that discrimination has become very sophisticated. It has become very, very sophisticated, very much more subtle than it was when I got here 34 years ago or 50 years ago. And employers don’t say anymore, you know, ‘‘We don’t like blacks in this company,’’ or ‘‘We don’t want women here.’’ They say things like, ‘‘Well, they wouldn’t fit in,’’ or, you know, ‘‘They tend to be too emotional,’’ or, you know, ‘‘a little high-strung.’’ I mean, there are all different ways in which now it has become so much more subtle. And that is why we all, Democrat and Republican, wrote Title VII. We wrote these laws to try to get at what we observed in the real world.
What we observed in the real world is it is real subtle, and so it is harder to make a case of discrimination, even though there is no doubt that it still exists.
And so I would like to talk to you about a couple of anti-discrimination cases. One is the Bray case. In that case, a black woman said she was denied a promotion for a job that she was clearly qualified for—there was no doubt she was qualified—and she said, ‘‘I was denied that job because I am a black woman.’’ And it was, as I said, indisputable she was qualified. It was indisputable that the corporation failed to follow their usual internal hiring procedures. And the corporation gave conflicting explanations as to why they reached a decision to hire another woman who they asserted was more qualified than Ms. Bray.
Now, the district court judge said, you know, Ms. Bray had not even made a prima facie case here—or she made a prima facie, but she had not made a sufficient showing to get to a jury, I am finding for the corporation here. And Ms. Bray’s attorney appealed, and it went up to the Third Circuit. And you and your colleagues disagreed. Two of your colleagues said, you know, Ms. Bray should have a jury trial here, and you said, no, I don’t think she should, and you set out a standard, as best I can understand it. And I want to talk to you about it. And your colleagues said that if they applied your standard in Title VII cases, discrimination cases, that it would effectively, their words, ‘‘eviscerate Title VII,’’ because, they went on to say, it ‘‘ignores the realities of racial animus.’’ They went on to say that ‘‘Racial animus runs so deep in some people

that they are incapable of acknowledging that a black woman is qualified for a job.’’
But, Judge, you dismissed that assertion. You said that the conflicting statements that the employer made were just loose language, and you expressed your concern about allowing disgruntled employees to impose costs of a trial on employers. And so your colleagues thought you set the bar, I think it is fair to say, pretty high in order to make the case that it should go to a jury.
Can you tell me what the difference is between a business judgment as to who is most qualified—because actually you said this comes down to ‘‘subjective business judgment’’—and discrimination? You said, ‘‘Subjective business judgment should prevail unless the qualifications of the candidate are extremely disproportionate.’’ What is the difference between that in today’s world and discrimination? I know you want to eliminate discrimination. Explain to me how that test is distinguishable from just plain old discrimination.
Judge ALITO. Well, this case was one of quite a few that we get that are on the line, and I think when you think about the nature of the appellate system, it stands to reason that it is going to work out that way. The really strong cases tend to settle; the really weak cases are either dismissed and not appealed, or they settle for modest amounts. So the ones that are hotly contested on appeal tend to be the ones that are close to the line, whatever the legal standard is.
Now, four Federal judges looked at the facts in this case. One was Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who was then the district court judge and is now one of my colleagues on the Third Circuit. I was one. And we thought the evidence was not quite sufficient. And then my colleague, Theodore McKee, and Judge Green, a district court judge from Philadelphia, a fine district court judge, sitting by designation, thought that the evidence was sufficient. And I think that division illustrates this was a factual case on which reasonable people would disagree. This was a case in which there was no direct evidence of discrimination, and I could not agree with you more that we can’t stop there. There are subtle forms of discrimination, and the judicial process has to be attentive to the fact that discrimination exists and today a lot of it is driven underground.
But all there was in this case were—all that the plaintiff could point to to show that there were facts from which you could infer discrimination were a very—what looked like a really minor violation of the company’s internal practices. They had a policy under which if somebody was being considered for a promotion, they would interview that person and they would decide we are going to promote or we are not going to promote. And if they decided they were not going to promote, then they were supposed to tell that person, ‘‘We’ve decided we’re not going to promote you,’’ before they go on to interviewing the next person. And in this instance, it appeared that they interviewed Ms. Bray, and they decided they weren’t going to promote her. And then they interviewed the other candidate, Ms. Real, before they told Ms. Bray that they weren’t going to promote her.
There was no—they had nothing to gain by doing that. So it is a fact to be considered—

365
Senator BIDEN. Judge, I don’t mean to interrupt. I want to make sure I understand. I think the reason for that policy is that that is the way people do discriminate. For example, you get somebody in, a woman, a black, a Hispanic, whomever, who is qualified but you don’t want to hire them. And if you say, OK, in your own mind, I am going to keep looking until I find someone who is more qualified so that I don’t have to hire—I mean, just so we both understand. That is why that rule is there. It is not just a little deal. It is the real world. That is how people work. People don’t say anymore, ‘‘I am not going to hire that man over there because he is black’’ or ‘‘he is Jewish’’ or ‘‘she is a woman.’’ They don’t do that anymore. What they do is they look around and they keep looking until they find someone, aha, I got one here who is a Rhodes scholar, I got one here who is a white male who happened to have experience doing it. That is why they have that rule.
So, again, I am not questioning your commitment to civil rights. What I do wonder about is whether or not you—it is presumptuous of me to say this—whether you fully appreciate how discrimination does work today. That is why the corporation set that rule up: Interview the one inside the company, that was our practice, hire inside, tell them they have the job or not, so that the supervisor, who may not want to work with a black woman, doesn’t get a chance to go, ‘‘I am going to keep looking. Send me in’’—‘‘find me somebody who has some experience somewhere else.’’ That is why they have the rule, right?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think you make a good point, Senator, but in this instance, my recollection is—and, in fact, I am quite sure of this. These were both people who were from the inside. They were both Marriott employees. And I think they were both being considered for the position at the time. So it wasn’t an instance in which they interviewed Ms. Bray and then they said, ‘‘Well, she is qualified, but we really don’t want to hire her. Let’s keep looking.’’
If there had been evidence to that effect, then I would certainly think for the reasons that you’ve outlined that you could draw a pretty substantial inference of an intent to discriminate from that.
Senator BIDEN. Well, Judge— Judge ALITO. But nothing like that was presented to us in that case, as I remember it. Senator BIDEN. Weren’t the facts in that case also that there was a Mr. Josten, who had held the very job—he was leaving the job. That is the job being filled. He said, ‘‘In my opinion, which I let be known’’—excuse me. I beg your pardon. It wasn’t Mr. Josten. The person who was giving up the job said, ‘‘In my opinion, I let it be known to Mr. Josten’’—the guy doing the hiring—‘‘which Mr. Josten was aware of, that Bray was more than qualified to take over my position as Director of Services at Park Ridge. To this day’’—this is a quote—‘‘I cannot understand why she was not offered the position.’’ That was in the record. It was in the record that Josten had said in a deposition under oath she is not qualified, when she clearly was qualified. I mean, I guess what I am curious about is why in a close case like this wouldn’t you let the jury decide it? Why did you become essentially the trier of fact? I mean, what was your thinking?

366
Judge ALITO. Well, my thinking was that the standard we were to apply was could a reasonable jury find that discrimination was proven here. And it was my view and it was the view of the district judge that a reasonable jury couldn’t find that. The district judge actually looked at the qualifications of the two candidates and said, ‘‘This isn’t even close. Ms. Real is much better qualified than Ms. Bray.’’
Now, I didn’t say that and I didn’t think that. I thought that they had somewhat different qualifications, and a reasonable person could view it either way. But there just wasn’t anything that I saw that a reasonable person could point to as a basis for a reasonable inference of an intent to discriminate.
Senator BIDEN. Well, again, I am puzzled by this, just trying to understand your reasoning, because as you accurately point out, you didn’t say the one was more qualified. You said they were equally qualified. And that is what puzzled me. And what really got my attention in the case was you have a collegial court, you know, the Third Circuit. I mean, that is my observation. I don’t follow it quite as closely as the man who has appointed about everybody on that court, our Chairman. But I follow it very closely, and I thought it was pretty strong language that the majority of your panel said that your standard would eviscerate the Ninth Amendment. That in Third Circuit language is a pretty strong statement.
Let me move on to another case, if I may, the Sheridan case, another discrimination case. Again, a little puzzling to me. This is a case where you were the only judge in this circumstance out of 11 judges on your circuit who heard the appeal who ruled that a jury trial should have been overruled—a jury verdict should have been overruled. In this case, a woman alleged that she was constructively discharged. For the non-lawyers listening to this, it means she basically was demoted to the point where she was, as a practical matter, forced to quit.
This woman alleged that she was constructively discharged, and she argued that it occurred after she had brought a discrimination claim and where the record showed that her employer said, ‘‘I am going to hound you like a dog.’’ It was in the record. ‘‘I am going to hound you like a dog for bringing this discrimination claim.’’
Now, there was more than one issue. One was whether this was vindictive—I forget the proper phrase—or whether or not she should have been promoted. The third was whether she was constructively discharged.
And the jury heard the case and said, ‘‘We conclude she was constructively discharged,’’ i.e., she was basically forced out, and she was forced out because she was being discriminated against. And 10 out of 11 of your colleagues reached that same conclusion.
But you said—and this is what I want you to explain to me. You said, ‘‘An employer may not wish to disclose his real reasons for taking punitive action against someone or not hiring someone or for his animosity toward someone.’’ And you went on to say, ‘‘The reason for the animosity on the part of the employer might be based on sheer personal antipathy,’’ which is OK.
Now, again, this is a matter of real world versus, you know, theoretically. Can you tell me how you can tell the difference when an employer is saying, ‘‘Ms. Feinstein, I am not going to hire you be-

cause the person seeking the job has a Rhodes scholarship and I like him better, and it turns out they weren’t a Rhodes scholar. The real reason is I just don’t like your glasses. I don’t like the way you look.’’
I am not being facetious. That is— [Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. I like the way you look, Dianne. You look OK. Senator BIDEN. For the record, I am a fan of the woman from California. But all kidding aside, I mean, that is how it read to me, that sheer personal antipathy is OK even when the employer’s reason for not hiring the person toward whom they showed sheer personal antipathy wasn’t true. How do you distinguish that from discrimination, subtle discrimination? That is tough for me. Judge ALITO. Well, this case concerned an issue that had really divided the courts of appeals at the time when our court addressed it. And the courts of appeals—this gets into a fairly technical question involving a Supreme Court case called the McDonnell Douglas case. But to put it in simple terms, the courts of appeals have divided into three camps on this. There was the pretext-plus camp, which was the one that was the least hospitable to claims by employees. There was the pretext-only camp, which was the camp that was most favorable to employees. And there was the middle camp. And my position was in the middle camp, and when the issue went to the Supreme Court—and it did a couple of years later—in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing, Justice O’Connor wrote the opinion for the Supreme Court, and she agreed with my analysis of this legal issue, that in most instances pretext is sufficient. In fact, in the vast majority of instances if the plaintiff can show or could point to enough evidence to show that the reason given by the employer is a pretext, is incorrect, then that is enough to go to the jury. In the vast majority of cases, that is sufficient, but not in every case, and that is what I said in Sheridan and that is what Justice O’Connor said when she wrote the opinion for the Supreme Court in Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing. Senator BIDEN. Well, I went back and read Reeves and I looked at O’Connor’s statements, and with all due respect you could argue she used the same standard, but it is clear to me she would have reached a different conclusion. She would have been with your ten colleagues. Here is what she said. She said in the Reeves case that she would not send the case to the jury if, and I am quoting, ‘‘One, the record conclusively revealed some other non-discriminatory reason for the employer’s decision.’’ I fail to see how the record conclusively showed that, and I doubt whether she would have seen that. Or, two, continuing to quote, ‘‘If the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer’s reason was untrue and there was abundant uncontroverted evidence that no discrimination had occurred.’’ It seems to me she is much more prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the employee in that situation and you are much prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the employer. I mean, by her own language, I find it hard to figure how she would have reached the same substantive conclusion that you did

that a jury trial wasn’t appropriate, notwithstanding the fact that I think you make a good point that the test she said was more like the test you said. But the real-world outcome, I think, she would have been—presumptuous of me to say it—I think it would have been 11 to 1 and not 10 to 2 had she been on the court, but who knows?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I think the vote on my court was a reflection of the standard that they applied and they did not apply the Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing standard. Of course, Reeves hadn’t been decided at that point, but they applied the standard that said if the plaintiff can create a fact issue as to whether it was pretextual, then that alone is sufficient. So they didn’t get into an evaluation of the sort of evidentiary points that you were mentioning.
Senator BIDEN. Well, they kind of did talk—you would know better than I, Judge. I don’t mean to suggest I am correcting you, but as I read the case, they did get into the minutia about—
Judge ALITO. They did. Senator BIDEN [continuing]. The factual minutia. And in the Reeves case, O’Connor, not that it is—because there are two different cases we are talking about here; we are talking about a similar rule, two different cases. O’Connor reversed the Fifth Circuit decision and here is what she said when she reversed it. She said that she reversed the lower court because, quote, ‘‘It proceeded from the assumption that a prime facie case of discrimination combined with sufficient evidence for the trier of fact to disbelieve the defendant’s legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its decision is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a jury finding of intentional discrimination.’’ It seems to me that is what you did. In my view, that is what you did—that is the conclusion you reached in the Sheridan case. She overruled in Reeves, as I read it. But at any rate, as someone once said, it is your day job and we do this part-time. We have other things like wars and foreign policy to deal with, so I am not presuming to be as knowledgeable about this as you are. Let me move on to a third case very quickly—I only have twoand-a-half minutes left—and it is the Casey case, Planned Parenthood. And I don’t care what your position is on abortion. This is not about your abortion position. It is about your reasoning here. As a matter of fact, with 2 minutes and 30 seconds, I probably can’t get into the case. maybe I should do it in a second round, but I should tell you now I want to talk to you about, again, the real world here and kind of the effects test. And so for me, Judge, where I am still remaining somewhat puzzled is on whether or not you—whether it is applying the unitary Executive standard and what you mean by that or whether it is the assertions made relative to how to look at discrimination cases, which are difficult, you seem to come down—I am not associating myself with the studies done—I don’t know enough to know whether they are correct or not—by Cass Sunstein or others. I don’t disagree with them. But as I have tried diligently to look at your record, you seem to come down more often and give the benefit of the doubt to the outfit against whom discrimination is being alleged. You seem to

lean—in close cases, you lean to the state versus the individual. Now, again, a lot of constitutional scholars would argue that is perfectly correct.
All I am suggesting is if I am right—and we will get a chance to do this again—if I am right, that would be a change that will occur, more than subtle, on the bench, on this Court, on a closely divided Court, which would take it in a direction that I am not as comfortable with as others may be.
But at any rate, you have been very gracious. I appreciate you being responsive, and I thank the Chair. And I want to note for maybe the first time in history, Biden is 40 seconds under his time.
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. It is greatly appreciated. We are going to stay in session for just ten more minutes and call now on Senator Kyl. Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, let me begin by just asking the witness if you would like to comment again on the unitary Executive. I have this specifically in mind because while I think I understood your explanation of it, Senator Biden just referred to it and I thought maybe it would be useful to draw the distinction that I heard you draw with respect to your discussion of the unitary Executive power, if you could do that, please. Judge ALITO. Yes, certainly, Senator. As I understand the concept, it is the concept that the President is the head of the Executive branch. The Constitution says that the President is given the Executive power and the idea of the unitary Executive is that the President should be able to control the Executive branch, however big it is or however small it is, whether it is as small as it was when George Washington was President or whether it is as big as it is today or even bigger. It has to do with control of whatever the Executive is doing. It doesn’t have to do with the scope of Executive power. It does not have to do with whether the Executive power that the President is given includes a lot of unnamed powers or what is often called inherent power. So it is the issue—it is the difference between scope and control. And as I understand the idea of the unitary Executive, it goes just to the question of control. It doesn’t go to the question of scope. Senator KYL. Of who eventually has the last say about Executive power, which would be the President? Judge ALITO. Right. Senator KYL. OK, thank you. Now, I want to also ask you a question which was asked of Judge Bork in his confirmation hearing, and his answer, as I understand it, was not well accepted by some Members of the Senate, was expressed as one of the reasons for their opposition to him. So it is more than just a mundane question, although it is a simple question. By accepting the President’s nomination, you have obviously expressed a willingness to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. So my question is why would you want to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court?

Judge ALITO. I think it is an opportunity for me to serve the country using whatever talent I have. I think that the courts have a very important role to play, but it is a limited role. So it is important for them to do a good job of doing what they are supposed to do, but also not to try to do somebody else’s job.
And I think that this is an area for—this is a way in which I can make a contribution to the country and to society. I have tried to do that on the court of appeals and I would continue to do that if I am confirmed for the Supreme Court.
Senator KYL. Thank you. Now, let me ask you a question that I also asked now Chief Justice John Roberts, and it is obvious from my question that I do not support the use of foreign law as authority in United States court opinions.
I mentioned to him the 2005 case of Roper v. Simmons, in which the Supreme Court spent perhaps 20 percent of its legal analysis discussing the laws of Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran, Nigeria and China. And I reminded the Committee of Justice Breyer’s 1999 dissent from denial of cert in Knight v. Florida, in which he relied on the legal opinions of Zimbabwe, India, Jamaica and Canada in arguing that a delay caused by a convicted murderer’s repeated appeals, appeals brought by the convict, should be considered cruel and unusual punishment.
I expressed my view that reliance on foreign law is contrary to our constitutional traditions. It undermines democratic self-government and it is utterly impractical, given the diversity of legal viewpoints worldwide. And I would add that it is needlessly disrespectful of the American people, as seen through the widespread public criticism of the trend.
Now, with my cards on the table, I turn to you. What is the proper role, in your view, of foreign law in U.S. Supreme Court decisions, and when, if ever, is citation to or reliance on these foreign laws appropriate?
Judge ALITO. I don’t think that foreign law is helpful in interpreting the Constitution. Our Constitution does two basic things. It sets out the structure of our Government and it protects fundamental rights. The structure of our Government is unique to our country, and so I don’t think that looking to decisions of supreme courts of other countries or constitutional courts in other countries is very helpful in deciding questions relating to the structure of our Government.
As for the protection of individual rights, I think that we should look to our own Constitution and our own precedents. Our country has been the leader in protecting individual rights. If you look at what the world looked like at the time of the adoption of the Bill of Rights, there were not many that protected human—in fact, I don’t think there were any that protected human rights the way our Bill of Rights did.
We have our own law, we have our own traditions, we have our own precedents, and we should look to that in interpreting our Constitution. There are other legal issues that come up in which I think it is legitimate to look to foreign law. For example, if a question comes up concerning the interpretation of a treaty that has been entered into by many countries, I don’t see anything wrong with seeing the way the treaty has been interpreted in other

371
countries. I wouldn’t say that that is controlling, but it is something that is useful to look to.
In private litigation, it is often the case—I have had cases like this in which the rule of decision is based on foreign law. There may be a contract between parties and the parties will say this contract is to be governed by the laws of New Zealand or wherever. So, of course, there, you have to look to the law of New Zealand or whatever the country is.
So there are situations in litigation that come up in Federal court when it is legitimate to look to foreign law, but I don’t think it is helpful in interpreting our Constitution.
Senator KYL. Thank you. Now, let me close with this question. In the Judiciary Committee’s questionnaire to you, you were asked about your views of judicial activism, and as part of your answer you said something intriguing to me. You said some of the finest chapters in the history of the Federal courts have been written when Federal judges, despite resistance, have steadfastly enforced remedies for deeply rooted constitutional violations.
How does one determine that a constitutional violation is deeply rooted, and can you elaborate on what you meant by that and when Federal courts should be especially aggressive in their use of equitable powers?
Judge ALITO. Well, what I was referring to were the efforts of Federal judges, lower Federal court judges in the South during the days after the decision in Brown v. Board of Education to try to implement that historic decision, despite enormous public resistance at times. But they—this was an example of the Federal judiciary not swaying in the wind of public opinion. There was a lot of opposition and I am sure that it didn’t make them popular.
I have read a number of books concerning the situation in which they found themselves, but on the whole they behaved—they did what a Federal judge is supposed to do, which is that they enforced the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that, after a long delay, vindicated what the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment was supposed to mean, which was to guarantee equal rights to people of all races.
Senator KYL. Are there other examples that come to your mind of that same application of power? It seems counter intuitive, but when you think about it, it is absolutely essential for the courts sometimes to buck public opinion and enforce what may be considered unpopular laws.
Judge ALITO. Well, there were some examples cited earlier today when the courts said that the Executive had overstepped the bounds of its authority. The Youngstown Steel case was cited, and that is certainly an example where President Truman thought that it was necessary to seize the steel mills so as not to interfere with the war effort in Korea. But the Supreme Court said that this was an overstepping of the bounds of Executive authority.
There was a reference to United States v. Nixon where the Supreme Court said that the President of the United States had to comply with grand jury subpoena for documents and they stood up for what they understood the law to mean, despite the fact that there must have been great pressure against them in another di-

rection. So when situations like that come up, it is the responsibility of the judiciary to hold fast.
Senator KYL. Mr. Chairman, since there are just about 30 seconds left here, rather than ask another question, let me just close with quoting three sentences from the letter sent by the American Bar Association to you dated January 9. I thought this was especially interesting in view of the subjects that they dealt with—the integrity of the nominee, as well as his abilities and character.
They said, ‘‘Fifty years ago, a Supreme Court Justice wrote of the traits of character necessary to serve well on the Supreme Court. He referred to the ability to put one’s passion behind one’s judgment instead of in front of it and to demonstrate what he called dominating humility. It is the belief of the Standing Committee that Judge Samuel Alito possesses those same qualities.’’
I think that is quite a testament to your character and your integrity, and I am sure you appreciate the Bar Association reaching that conclusion.
Judge ALITO. Thank you very much, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. We will now recess until 2:15, at which time Senator Kyl will be recognized for 20 minutes, which is the balance of his 30-minute first round. Recess until 2:15. [Whereupon, at 1:04 p.m., a luncheon recess was taken.] [AFTERNOON SESSION 2:15 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will turn now to Senator Kyl, who has 20 more minutes on his first round of 30 minutes. Senator Kyl? Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First let me ask unanimous consent to put three items in the record, one of these items related to—actually, two of them relate to the matter of the CAP that we have heard something about. I would like to enter into the record two letters by Democratic attorneys that make clear that Judge Alito has been extremely helpful in advancing the interest of women and minorities. One letter notes that as U.S. Attorney, he put women and minorities in supervisory positions. The other is from the President-elect of the National Bar Association for Women. And also a Washington Post article from January 9th, in which criminal defense lawyer and Democrat, Alberto Rivas, who served in the U.S. Attorney’s Office when Judge Alito was in charge said, speaking of the judge, ‘‘While he opposed numeric hiring quotas, he took steps to diversify an office that had the reputation of something of a white boys’ club. Mr. Chairman, I hope that this will help address what I think is almost getting to be a— Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Senator KYL. Thank you. Secondly, there has been some discussion of this Knight-Ridder article that has, to be my understanding, been rather completely discredited, and I ask unanimous consent that the attached document analyzing that article be added to the record. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.

Senator KYL. Before the break, Senator Biden suggested that— at least I understood him to suggest that there was no reason to belong to this organization, CAP, in 1985 because ROTC was safely on campus at that time.
Judge, let me ask you a question. Do you know what year you joined the CAP?
Judge ALITO. I don’t know, Senator. I tried to rack my memory about that, but as I said, if I had been active in my membership, I think I certainly would have remembered that, and if I had renewed the membership, I think I would remember that. So my best reconstruction of this is that it probably was sometime around the time when I wrote that statement.
Senator KYL. Long after you were gone from the school. Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator KYL. In that event, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to include in the record an article from the campus newspaper, the Princeton Packet, dated February 12th, 1985, which expressly explains that ROTC was a core motivation behind the CAP in 1985. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Senator KYL. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I noted with interest a comment that Senator Durbin made in his opening statement because it referred to a good friend and former colleague of ours, Senator Simon, who put forth a pretty good test about courts. He said that the real test is, is the Court restricting freedom or expanding it? I thought about that because it seems to me that so many of these cases about expanding freedom or restricting it are cases that boil down to the eye of the beholder. I specifically thought about the Ninth Circuit case, because my State is from the Ninth Circuit, outlawing ‘‘under God’’ in the Pledge of Allegiance, saying that that is unconstitutional. I checked, according to the one survey that I had access to, 93 percent of the American people support the right to say ‘‘under God’’ in the Pledge of Allegiance. I know that the plaintiff in the case, Michael Newdow, thought that he was advancing his freedom or his daughter’s freedom in successfully getting the Court to strike it down, but it seems to me that the majority of the people are having their freedom restricted in such a case. And I certainly will not ask you because that case could well come before the Court again. I would not ask you how you would rule on it. But as a general proposition, this matter of restricting freedom, is it not the case that in many situations you have two competing types of freedom or liberty involved and it is a question of interpreting the Constitution rather than specifically setting out to advance one sort of freedom as opposed to another? Judge ALITO. I think that’s exactly right, Senator. Often there are conflicting freedoms and that makes the case difficult. Senator KYL. Let me ask you too, there was a concern expressed by Senator Biden that the big factor in your nomination in his view was the fact that you would be replacing Justice Sandra O’Connor, and that that might mean that you would change the direction of the Court. That is the concern expressed anyway. As has been famously said, I know Justice O’Connor. I have been a friend of hers for at least 30 years, and I do not think she is any kind of a liberal
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00385 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

member of the Court. She might properly be called moderately conservative. I am not sure how she would characterize herself. But I noted that of the 109 Justices to sit on the Supreme Court, nearly half, 46 to be exact, have replaced judges appointed by another political party, so it is not at all uncommon, indeed, it is almost half the situations in which a different party nominates the Justice replacing a sitting Justice, and one might expect, therefore, some difference.
But I checked the record because this had been brought up by Senator Brownback yesterday. I found in the nomination of Justice Ginsburg and the confirmation hearings there, she replaced Justice White, who I think rightly has been called a centrist on the Court, certainly not a liberal, and yet I saw not one expression of concern by any Senator, Democrat or Republican, that Justice Ginsburg might be ruling quite a bit differently than Justice White in decisions in the Court.
So it seems to me that that is not a test that is rightly applied. That is a results-oriented test, exactly the same kind of thing that you have said that judges should not do when they approach cases.
Let me get to a point that Senator Kennedy made. He said that you have been overly deferential to Executive power, and criticized what he called—and I think I have this quotation exactly—‘‘your almost total disregard of the impact of these powers on the rights of individuals.’’ I would like to know what your response is to that charge and whether you can cite some specific cases that would refute what he said.
Judge ALITO. Certainly, Senator. I have tried to decide every case on its own merits, and sometimes that means siding with the Government, and sometimes it means siding with the party who’s claiming a violation of rights, and I do it on an individual basis. Cases that show that I do that are cases like United States v. Kithcart, which was a case in which an African-American man had been stopped by police officers because he was—because there had been a description of some robbery suspects, and they had been described as—the perpetrator was described as a black man in a black car, and Mr. Kithcart was a black man in a black car. And they thought that was sufficient to stop the car, and I wrote an opinion saying that that was insufficient, and that was basically racial profiling and was not permitted.
Another example is Bolden v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which had to do with a drug test, and I found that the test there constituted a search and a seizure and would be a violation absent consent on the part of the party who was searched. There have been a number of criminal cases in which I’ve sided with the person claiming a violation of rights. Carpenter v. Vaughn was a case in which I wrote an opinion reversing a death— I joined an opinion reversing a death penalty. The Bronshtein case was another case that came up fairly recently in which I joined an opinion reversing a death penalty. There have been quite a few cases of this nature, Senator.
Senator KYL. I noted a tax case too, or a case involving tax evasion, Leveto v. Lapina. Do you remember that 2001 case?
Judge ALITO. I do. That was the case in which there was a search of a—I believe it was the office of a veterinarian, and in a

375
way that is a similar case to the Mellott case that I was discussing earlier, although in Mellott I thought that the search was carried out properly. In the Leveto case, on the facts of that case, I thought the search was not carried out properly, that the officers violated the Fourth Amendment in the way they went about carrying out that search. They forced the occupants of these premises to remain on the premises for a very extended period of time while the search was being conducted, and violated their Fourth Amendment rights, and that’s what I said in the opinion.
Senator KYL. Do you have an idea of how many cases that have gone to decision that you have participated in on your 15 years as a Circuit Court Judge?
Judge ALITO. I think it’s well over 4,000 on the merits. Senator KYL. I suspect that of those 4,000 cases there might be one or two that I would disagree with your decisions on, maybe even more than that. But the point here is there are numerous cases in which you have found that the Government acted improperly in criminal law context, in warrant context, in discrimination context, in other cases in which you have found either that the Government acted properly, or that at a minimum, Government officials were entitled to some immunity with respect to being privately sued; is that correct? Judge ALITO. That’s correct, Senator. Senator KYL. Let me also address this question of discrimination, especially racial discrimination. This is a matter that was discussed in some prior questioning. Specifically, in Senator Biden’s questions, it dealt with the Sheridan case in which you were the sole dissenter. In the subsequent U.S. Supreme Court case, the Reeves decision, my understanding from your answer is that the Supreme Court addressed the same issue of law that you and your colleagues had disagreed about, and that the U.S. Supreme Court voted unanimously, and in an opinion written by Justice O’Connor, that the test that you used in the Sheridan case was the correct test to use; is that correct? Judge ALITO. Yes, Senator, that is correct. Senator KYL. Now, there are some other cases involving employees claiming racial discrimination that I have looked at, and one of the Senators seemed to suggest in a comment that he made that you had never written opinions or decided cases for a black plaintiff. Is that a fair statement? Judge ALITO. No, it’s not accurate. Senator KYL. Do you recall cases in which you upheld the discrimination claims of racial minorities? Judge ALITO. There was the case of Goosby v. Johnson & Johnson, and that case could be considered together with the Bray case that I was discussing before the break. Those were both cases in which my colleague, Judge McKee wrote the opinion, and in the Goosby case I agreed with him. It was a similar case, but it was a case where I thought the facts fell on the other side of the line. There was a case called Smith v. Davis, which was another case where I joined an opinion upholding the claim of an African-American who was claiming racial discrimination. The Robinson case involved claims of race and gender discrimination, as I recall. There are a number of cases in the criminal law context. I just mentioned

the Kithcart case. There was the Brinson case. There was Williams v. Price. There have been many cases involving other forms of discrimination, age discrimination, the Showalter case; disability case, the Mondzelewski case; the case of Shapiro v. Lakewood Township. There was Zubi v. AT&T, which was a case involving the statute of limitations for a claim of racial discrimination.
Senator KYL. And you were the lone dissenter in that case, is that correct?
Judge ALITO. I was the dissenter in that case. Senator KYL. And your position was what? Judge ALITO. My position was that—the majority’s position was that the claim had to be thrown out because the statute of limitations had been violated, and my position was that the claim should be allowed to go forward because the statute of limitations was longer than the majority had recognized. And that case—that issue later went to the Supreme Court in a case called Jones v. Donnelley and the Supreme Court agreed with my position, that the longer statute of limitations applied. Senator KYL. I note there is another case involving an AfricanAmerican woman who claimed that her coworkers had made racial and sexual slurs against her, denied her training opportunities and so on, and you ruled that she was entitled to $124,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees, a case called Reynolds v. USX Corporation. Do you remember that case? Judge ALITO. That’s right, Senator. Senator KYL. So the bottom line is there are numerous cases in which you have ruled in favor of minorities, in particular, AfricanAmericans in discrimination situations, and also where you have dissented in a situation which your position was to support the claim of discrimination, and that it would be inaccurate to say that you have not taken that position in the 4,000 plus cases that you have decided; is that correct? Judge ALITO. That’s certainly correct, Senator. Senator KYL. There has been a lot of talk about precedent and stare decisis. It is certainly something that we lawyers are familiar with. We regard it as a key principle in deciding cases. There was a case that was mentioned by a couple of my Democratic colleagues that I am sure will be discussed further, but I thought I would give you an opportunity to talk about it because it certainly seemed to me to be a case in which you were very—that you were trying to apply a Supreme Court precedent, the precedent being the Lopez v. United States case, a case, by the way, which I note that is one of those decisions that Justice O’Connor was in the majority, a 5– 4 decision, which her position could be characterized as the swing vote. Now you, in United States v. Rybar, agreed with Justice O’Connor and the way that the law should be applied relative to intrastate possession of a weapon. The Lopez case dealt with a congressional Act that said that weapons should not be possessed near schools. The Court struck that down, saying that that went beyond the Commerce Clause capability of commerce to legislate in matters of interstate commerce. In Rybar, what was the issue? You dissented.

By the way, one of the reasons why this case is interesting to me is because the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, again, which is my circuit, has subsequently ruled—and this is not a conservative court in most people’s estimation—recently agreed with your dissent in a case called U.S. v. Stewart, a 2003 case, in which the Court overturned the defendant’s conviction under the very same statute, holding that the law exceeded Congress’s commerce powers.
It seems to me that it would be hard to argue that your position is per se unreasonable, but could you describe it in your own words?
Judge ALITO. My position in Rybar was really a very modest position, and it did not go to the question of whether Congress can regulate the possession of machine guns. In fact, I explained in the opinion that it would be easy for Congress to do that in a couple of ways that differed from the way in which it was done in Rybar.
The statute in Rybar was very similar to the statute that was at issue in Lopez. In fact, I think they are the only two Federal firearm statutes that have been cast in that mold. They simply prohibited the possession of firearms without either congressional findings concerning the effect of the activity on interstate commerce, or a jurisdictional element. And I knew from my experience as a Federal prosecutor that most of the Federal firearms statutes have a jurisdictional element right in the statute. What that means is that when the prosecutor presents the case in court, the statute that is used most frequently is the statute that makes it a crime for someone who’s been convicted of a felony to possess a firearm.
And in that case, when the prosecutor presents the case in court, the prosecutor has to show that the defendant has been convicted of a felony, and that the firearm in question had some connection with interstate commerce.
Under Supreme Court precedent, a case called Scarborough, all that’s necessary is to show that the firearm, at some point in its history, passed an interstate or foreign commerce, was manufactured in one State and then later turned up in another State, or manufactured in a foreign country and brought to the United States.
From my experience, this was never a practical problem, and this was how all the Federal firearms statutes had been framed. But for whatever reasons, the statute in Lopez and the statute in Rybar were lacking that jurisdictional element. So an easy way in would Congress could regulate the possession of a machine gun would be to insert a jurisdictional element. And as I pointed out, as I just pointed out, in my experience as the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, that was never a practical problem.
The Supreme Court in Lopez said that there were three reasons why there was a problem with the statute there, and that case had been decided just the year before. And it was my obligation as a lower-court judge to follow it. The first was that it involved what the Court characterized as the noncommercial activity, and that was the possession of a firearm. And, of course, that was exactly the same activity that was at issue in Rybar. The second was the absence of a jurisdictional element, and there was no jurisdictional element in either statute. And the third was the absence of a con-

378
gressional finding connecting the activity that was being regulated with interstate commerce. And I pointed out in my opinion that I would have viewed the Rybar case very differently if there had been a congressional finding, or if the Justice Department, in presenting its argument to us, had been able to point to anything that showed that there was a substantial effect on interstate commerce, which is what the Supreme Court says is required.
Senator KYL. So this is one of those situations in which, if the result was not what was intended, you were willing to point out in your decision what Congress could relatively easily have done to get the result that it appeared that Congress wanted to achieve?
Judge ALITO. That’s exactly correct. Senator KYL. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Kyl. Senator Kohl? Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, we heard a lot of discussion yesterday about the proper role of the judge in our system. Some said that a judge should favor neither the ‘‘big guy or the little guy, but simply apply the law and not make the law.’’ Based on what you said yesterday, I believe that you would agree generally with this characterization. However, to me it is not quite so simple. Just as no two umpires call the same game exactly, no two judges see a case in exactly the same way. Laws and the Constitution are often ambiguous and capable of many interpretations. Those interpretations are the result of judges with different judicial philosophies. Some judges have a more liberal judicial philosophy, while others are more conservative, and we are here trying to figure out what your judicial philosophy is. That is probably the principal point of this hearing. If the law were so simple, we would not have as many 5–4 decisions. It seems to me that many of the most fundamental protections of civil rights and civil liberties that we take for granted today, things such as school integration, the principle of one person/one vote, the principle that the accused have a right to a lawyer in criminal cases, and the right of contraception, just to name a few, have come when judges have been willing to look beyond rigid legal doctrines that prevailed at the times of those rulings. The neutral approach, that of the judge just applying the law, is very often inadequate to ensure social progress, right historic wrongs, and protect civil liberties so essential to our democracy. So isn’t it true, Judge Alito, that a neutral judge would never have reached these conclusions? In fact, for decades, courts did not reach these conclusions. So would you agree that these cases were rightly decided, No. 1, and required, No. 2, that judges apply a more expansive, imaginative view of the Constitution? Judge ALITO. I think that the Constitution contains both some very specific provisions, and there the job of understanding what the provision means and applying it to new factual situations that come up is relatively easy. The Constitution sets age limits, for example, for people who want to hold various Federal offices, and there can’t be much debate about what that means or how it applies. But it also contains some broad principles—no unreasonable searches and seizures, the guarantee that nobody will be deprived

of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, equal protection of the laws. And in those instances, it is the job of the judiciary to try to understand the principle and apply it to the new situations that come before the judiciary.
I think the judiciary has to do that in a neutral fashion. I think judges have to be wary about substituting their own preferences, their own policy judgments for those that are in the Constitution. They have to identify the principle that is to be applied under these broader provisions of the Constitution and apply it, but I don’t see that as being the same thing as the judge’s injecting his or her policy views or preferences or ideas about the direction in which the society should be moving into the decisionmaking process.
Senator KOHL. These decisions to which I just referred push society into new directions, and they came about, didn’t they, as a result of the Supreme Court’s willingness to look at the Constitution in perhaps a different way, in a new way, and take a new approach and a new avenue, which is not entirely consistent with a neutral judge simply applying the law. The law is the law. It is not hard to find that out. As you somewhat suggested, if you are an umpire, a ball is a ball, a strike is a strike. I am suggesting that it is— and I think I would like to hope you would agree. It is somewhat, if not a lot more complex and sophisticated. If it weren’t true, we could have a lot of views here today.
I think you are unique in many ways, and part of that is your complexity, your sophistication, your ability to look at the Constitution and, if necessary, see new meanings that weren’t seen there before. Isn’t that true?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I would never say that it is an easy process. There are some easy cases, but there are a lot of very difficult cases. And once you have identified the principle, the job of applying it to particular cases is often not easy at all. But what the judge has to do is make sure that the judge is being true to the principle that is expressed in the Constitution and not to the judge’s principle, not to some idea that the judge has. And sometimes this results in ground-breaking decisions. Sometimes that is because new issues come up. Sometimes it is because the principle that is embodied in a constitutional provision has long been neglected.
That was certainly true with respect to the Equal Protection Clause. There was a long period between Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education when the true meaning of the Equal Protection Clause was not recognized in the decisions of the Supreme Court, and when Brown was finally decided, that was not an instance of the Court changing the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause. It was an instance of the Court righting an incorrect interpretation that had prevailed for a long period of time.
Senator KOHL. Judge Alito, one of the ways you get at a person’s judicial philosophy is to look at the people whom they admire. In an interview that you gave in 1988, you were asked about your thoughts about Judge Robert Bork’s nomination, and you said, and I quote, ‘‘Judge Bork was one of the most outstanding nominees of this century.’’

Many Americans do not share Judge Bork’s narrow views about the Constitution, views that would undermine many of the rights that we now take for granted, Judge Alito. Judge Bork thought that Americans had no constitutional right to use contraception, saying, and I quote, ‘‘The right to procreate is not guaranteed explicitly or implicitly by the Constitution.’’
Judge Bork thought minorities had no constitutional right to have their votes counted equally, saying that in guaranteeing one man/one vote, the Court ‘‘stepped beyond its boundaries as an original matter.’’
In 1981, Judge Bork called Roe v. Wade ‘‘an unconstitutional decision, serious and wholly unjustifiable usurpation of State legislative authority.’’
In addition, he had an unreasonably broad view of Executive power, claiming that a law requiring the President to obtain an order from a court before conducting surveillance in the United States and against U.S. citizens for foreign intelligence purposes was ‘‘a thoroughly bad idea, and almost certainly unconstitutional.’’
Can we assume from your admiration of Judge Bork that you agree with some of these statements or at least that you support some of these beliefs if you were sitting on the Supreme Court? Frankly, it is curious to me that someone like yourself would consider someone with his views to be ‘‘one of the most outstanding nominees of this century.’’
Judge ALITO. Senator, when I made that statement in 1988, I was an appointee in the Reagan administration, and Judge Bork had been a nominee of the administration, and I had been a supporter of the nomination. And I don’t think the statement goes beyond that.
There are issues with respect to which I probably agree with Judge Bork, and there are a number of issues on which I disagree with him. And most of the things that you just mentioned are points on which I would disagree with him. I expressed my view about Griswold earlier this morning. On the issue of reapportionment, as I sit here today in 2006—and I think that is what is most relevant—I think that the principle of one person/one vote is a fundamental part of our constitutional law. And I think it would be— I don’t see any reason why it should be re-examined, and I don’t know that anybody is asking for that to be done. Every legislative district in the country and every congressional district in the country has been reapportioned, has been redistricted numerous times in reliance on the principle of one person/one vote. And the old ways of organizing State legislatures have long been forgotten. So I think that is very well settled now in the constitutional law of our country.
Under the Fourth Amendment, I have no question about the decision in United States v. United States District Court, which held—and I think that is what you were referring to, which held that a warrant is required for domestic security surveillance, and that was the decision that led to the enactment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
Senator KOHL. Of course. I was only referring to or trying to refer to your quote with respect to him and the positions he held, which I suggested were at variance with the positions I thought

you held, which you are affirming here in your answer. So that the quote you are pointing out was something you made as an employee of the Reagan administration?
Judge ALITO. I was, and that was in—I saw that quoted in the paper yesterday. I think that was in 19—
Senator KOHL. Not necessarily expressing your own real views? Judge ALITO. I was a supporter of the nominee of the administration, and he was the nominee of the administration. He was and is an accomplished scholar. He had contributed a great deal to constitutional debate with his writings. But I don’t agree with him on a number of issues, and I mentioned—you hit some of the issues on which I would definitely disagree with him. Senator KOHL. Very good. Judge Alito, in a document appended to your job applications, you also wrote that, ‘‘I disagree strenuously with the usurpation by the judiciary of decisionmaking authority that should be exercised by branches of Government responsible to the electorate.’’ The statement is especially troubling given that elsewhere in this application you wrote, ‘‘I developed a deep interest in constitutional law motivated in large part by disagreement with Warren Court decisions, particularly in the areas of criminal procedure, Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.’’ Judge Alito, what Warren Court cases were you specifically talking about—Miranda, one person/one vote, any of the privacy decisions? What in particular were you talking about? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I am happy to address that. The statement was made in that 1985 form, and, of course, that was written 20 years ago. And in the form, what I was doing was sort of outlining the development of my thinking about constitutional law, and I went so far as to go back to my college days, which were before, of course, I had even attended law school, much less practiced law or served as a judge. I mentioned some of the leading areas that were covered by decisions of the Warren Court, and the decisions of the Warren Court really stimulated my interest in constitutional law. And I mentioned a book that had been published the time, Alexander Bickel’s book ‘‘The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress,‘‘ which was probably the first book about what you might call constitutional theory that I had read. And he was someone who I think most people would describe as a liberal, but he was a critic of the Warren Court for a number of reasons. And he was a great proponent of judicial self-restraint, and that was the main point that I took from my pre-law school study of the Warren Court. I spoke a bit about the reapportionment decisions. I don’t believe that I—in fact, I am quite sure I never was opposed to the one person/one vote concept. I do recall quite clearly that my father’s work at the time working for the New Jersey Legislature and working on reapportionment had brought to my attention the question of just how far that principle of one person/one vote had to be taken in drawing legislative districts. The New Jersey Legislature and many other legislatures at the time were trying to redraw their districts in accordance with Reynolds v. Sims, which set out the one person/one vote principle. But it wasn’t clear how exactly equal the districts had to be in popu-

382
lation. And in some of the late Warren Court decisions, the Court seemed to suggest—did say so for congressional districts that they had to be almost exactly equal in population. And this idea, if applied to the legislatures and to the New Jersey legislative plan, would have wiped the plan out because there were population deviations which, although not very large, were much larger than the Court had said they were going to tolerate in the case of congressional districts. And I do remember that quite specifically.
Professor Bickel made the argument that the Court had taken the one person/one vote principle too far, and I know my father had said that although he thought it was a good idea, the idea of trying to get the districts to be exactly equal in population at the expense of looking at other factors, such as the shape of the district and respecting county lines or municipal lines, was a bad idea.
Senator KOHL. Judge Alito, you stated in that same job application that one element of the conservative philosophy that you believe ‘‘very strongly’’ was the ‘‘legitimacy of a government role in protecting traditional values.’’ What traditional values were you referring to? And who decides what is a ‘‘traditional value’’ ?
Judge ALITO. Well, again, I’m trying to remember what I thought about that 20 years ago, and I’m trying to reconstruct it.
I think a traditional value that I probably had in mind was the ability to live in peace and safety in your neighborhood, and that was a big issue during the time of the Warren Court, and it was still a big issue in 1985 when I wrote that statement because that was a time of very high crime rates. I think that is a traditional value.
I think the ability of people to raise a family and raise their children in accordance with their own beliefs is a traditional value. I think the ability to raise a family, raise children in a way that they are not only subjected to—they are spared physical threats but also psychological threats that can come from elements in the atmosphere is a traditional value. I think that the ability to practice your own conscience is a traditional value.
That is the best I can reconstruct it now, thinking back to 1985. Senator KOHL. Very good. Judge Alito, in Casey you argued that the requirement that a woman notify her husband did not impose an undue burden upon a woman. You reasoned in part that the number of married women who would seek an abortion without notifying their husbands would be rather small. In other words, only some women would be affected. The majority in that case disagreed with you and stated, ’’Whether the adversely affected group is but a small fraction of the universe, a pregnant woman desiring an abortion seems to us irrelevant to the issue.’’ This disagreement begs the question. Is a constitutional right any less of a right if only one person suffers a violation? Or should greater value be placed on that right if a larger number of people had that right violated? Judge ALITO. Trying to apply the undue burden test at that time to the provisions of the Pennsylvania statute that were before the court in Casey was extremely difficult, and I can really remember wrestling with the problem and I took it very seriously and I mentioned that in my opinion and it presented some really difficult

383
issues. Part of the problem was that the law just was not very clear at that time.
The undue burden standard had been articulated by Justice O’Connor in several of her own opinions and there were just a few hints in those opinions about what she meant by it. But what she said was that an undue burden consisted of an absolute obstacle or an extreme burden. Those may not be exact quotes, but they’re pretty close. And she did say that it was insufficient to show simply that a regulation of abortion would inhibit some women from going forward and having an abortion. Those were the—that was the information that was available in her opinions to try to understand what this test meant.
And so then the question became, how do you apply that to the numerous provisions of the Pennsylvania statute that were before us, and it was a difficult task. The plaintiffs argued that all the provisions constituted an undue burden, and when the case went to the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens agreed with that. He said they all were an undue burden. Things like a 24-hour waiting period, that was an undue burden because it would inhibit some women from having an abortion. An informed consent provision, Justice Stevens thought and plaintiffs argued that would be an undue burden.
The majority on my panel and the joint opinion on the Supreme Court found that most of the provisions of the statute did not amount to an undue burden, the 24-hour waiting period, the informed consent provision, and all of them. We disagreed on only one, and that was the provision regarding spousal notification with a safety valve provision there that no sort of notification was needed if the woman thought that providing the notification would present a threat of physical injury to her. And I wrestled with that issue, but based on the information that I had from Justice O’Connor’s opinions, it seemed to me that this was not what she had in mind. Now, that turned out not to be a correct prediction about how she herself would apply the undue burden standard to that statutory provision, but that was the best I could do under the circumstances.
Senator KOHL. Judge Alito, in your 1985 job application memo again, you identified reapportionment as one of the three issued decided by the Warren Court with which you disagreed. You even stated that your disagreement was so strong that it was one of the reasons that you became a lawyer. The Supreme Court’s Warren Court decisions on this topic, of course, stood for the fundamental principle of one person/one vote, meaning as a matter of constitutional law that each person’s vote must count equally and each electoral district must have the same population.
These decisions were more than 20 years old by the time of your 1985 job application and these decisions stand for a fundamental principle of democracy. By 1985, virtually no serious scholar or constitutional lawyer could be found to disagree with the principle that each person’s vote should count equally. So what was your disagreement with the Warren Court’s decisions on this issue, Judge Alito, in 1985? Isn’t one person/one vote a basic principle of democracy? Wasn’t it in 1985?

Judge ALITO. Senator, I don’t believe that I disagreed with the principle of one person/one vote in 1985. I was talking about how I got interested in constitutional law back in college and I was certainly stimulated at that time by my consideration of the issue of one person/one vote. But the issue that troubled me toward the end of the Warren Court, and this was during the time when I was in college, was the question of how far this principle went when it came to drawing legislative districts. Did they have to be almost exactly equal in population in accordance with the last census, or were larger population variations permitted?
In a case called Kirkpatrick v. Preisler and another one called Wells v. Rockefeller that were decided around 1969, which was right at the end of Chief Justice Warren’s tenure on the Supreme Court, the Court held that in the case of congressional districts, they had to be almost exactly equal in population, and as I said, my father was deeply involved in this. When the issue came up again in the context of congressional districting in Carcher v. Daggett, which was around 1985, that was the case where he had been an expert witness and the Court struck down the New Jersey congressional districting plan even though the population variations were under 1 percent. Now, the Court also later said that when you’re talking about legislative districts, considerably larger deviations are allowed and you can take into account municipal lines and county lines and things of that nature.
But as of the time when I was in college, as in the time of the two cases that I mentioned, it seemed likely—a lot of people thought, and certainly I as a college student thought that the rule was going to be the same for congressional districts as it was for legislative districts and that seemed to say that the districts would have to be almost exactly equal in population based on the last census.
Now, a problem with that is that while the census is very accurate, it’s not perfect and it doesn’t stay accurate throughout the 10year period from census to census. People move around. The population grows. The population diminishes in certain areas. So it didn’t seem to make a whole lot of sense, let’s say in the middle of a decade, to insist on absolute population equality based on the last previous census when everybody knew that the census figures had changed, and in doing that, in insisting on practically equal population districts, districts of almost exactly equal population, you disregard municipal lines, you disregard county lines. People don’t know which district they’re going to be voting in. You introduce the possibility of other factors figuring into the districting plan.
Senator KOHL. OK. Family and Medical Leave Act, Judge Alito. In my view, one of the most important pieces of social legislation enacted in the last two decades was the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1993. Among other things, it gives employees the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or an ill parent or a spouse. The statute also gives an employee the right to sue his or her employer for damages if the employer violates the employee’s rights under this law.
I was disturbed to learn that in the Chittister case, Judge Alito, your ruling denied a State employee the ability to sue his employer

for money damages. Your reasoning was directly repudiated by the 2003 Supreme Court decision of Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs. In that case, the Supreme Court, in a decision written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, held that the Family and Medical Leave Act was congruent and proportional to Congress’s interest in preventing discrimination based on gender, and therefore States could be sued for money damages under the law.
So we are concerned that your view shows a lack of understanding of the problems of ordinary working Americans and the right of women to be free of discrimination in the workplace. Isn’t it true that under your view, potentially millions of working Americans would not get the protections that they rely on under the Family and Medical Leave Act? Judge Alito?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I’m happy to address that because I think there’s been some confusion about what the issue was in Chittister and how it relates to the Supreme Court’s decision in Nevada v. Hibbs, and they’re actually two entirely different provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act.
The provision that was at issue in my case was not the one in Hibbs and at last count, seven circuits had decided that issue, the issue that was before my court in Chittister, exactly the same way we did. I counted up the number of Court of Appeals judges who endorsed that position and it’s over 20. I think it’s 22. And they include some of the most distinguished Court of Appeals judges in the country and judges who have been appointed by Presidents of both parties.
The issue in Hibbs had to do with a provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act that requires employers to provide employees with a certain amount of leave for the purpose of taking care of another family member. The provision—and that was the one that the Supreme Court addressed in the Hibbs case. The provision in the Chittister case is a provision that requires employers to give employees a certain amount of leave for personal illness. The standard that has to be applied here is the one the Supreme Court has set out, and it’s a controversial standard, but as a lower court judge, it’s the one I had to apply, and that was whether what was done was congruent and proportional to constitutional violations.
What the Court said in Hibbs was that there was a record of constitutional violations, and remember, here we’re talking about the provision that has to do with leave to take care of another person, and what they said was that there were many instances in which employers, State employers, had plans that provided more leave for that purpose for women than for men and the reason was because of the stereotype that if somebody in the family got sick, it would be the woman, not a man, who would have to take off from work to take care of that person.
But the provision that was at issue in Chittister had to do with leave for one’s own personal illness and there was no record that employers give—and a man was subjected to this, and there was no record that State employers, or for that matter any other employers, had plans that provided more sick leave for men than for women or that any stereotypes were involved in the situation. And so that was why I concluded, and the unanimous panel that I sat on concluded, and all of these seven other circuits concluded that

that provision did not satisfy the standard that the Supreme Court had established.
Senator KOHL. A last question. Judge Alito, I understand that you’re reluctant to comment on cases that you would likely have coming before you in the future, but I’d like to ask you a question about a case that the Supreme Court certainly will never see again, the 2000 Presidential election contest between President Bush and Vice President Gore. Many commentators see the Bush v. Gore decision as an example of judicial activism, an example of the judiciary improperly injecting itself into a political dispute. Indeed, it appears to many of us who have looked at your record that Bush v. Gore seems contrary to so many of the principles that you stand for, that the President has said you stand for when making your nomination in talking about judicial restraint, not legislating from the bench and, of course, respecting the rights of the States.
So, Judge Alito, I’d like to ask you, was the Supreme Court correct to take this case in the first place?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I think you’re probably right and I hope you’re right that that sort of issue doesn’t come before the Supreme Court again. Some of the—the Equal Protection ground that the majority relied on in Bush v. Gore does involve principles that could come up in future elections and in future cases.
But as to that particular case, my answer has to be, I really don’t know. I have not had the opportunity—I have not studied it in the way I would study a case that comes before me as a judge and I would have to go through the whole judicial process—
Senator KOHL. That was a huge, huge case and I would like to hope, and I would bet, that you thought about it an awful lot because you are who you are. And I would like for you to give an opinion from the convictions of your heart, as a person who’s very restrained with respect to judicial activism, this being a case of extreme judicial activism. Were they correct in taking this case, in your opinion?
Judge ALITO. Well, there’s the issue of whether they should have taken it and the issue of how it should be decided, and Senator, my honest answer is I have not studied it in the way I would study the issue if it were to come before me as a judge and that would require putting out of my mind any personal thoughts that I had on the matter and thinking about the—listening to all the arguments and reading the briefs and thinking about it in the way that I do when I decide legal issues that are before me as a judge. That’s the only—that’s the best answer I can give you to that question. It was obviously a very important and difficult and controversial case, and in a situation like that, the obligation of a judge all the more is to be restrained and not to—is to go through the judicial decisionmaking process, and only at the end of that reach a conclusion about the issue.
Senator KOHL. Thank you, Judge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kohl. Senator DeWine? Senator DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, you have almost turned the corner here, so that’s the good news. The bad news is, this is just the first round. [Laughter.]

Senator DEWINE. Let me respond, if I could, Judge, to three things that I’ve heard so far during these hearings that have, frankly, disturbed me. First, I am bothered by what I consider to be distortions of your record, really in an effort to make you look like something that you are not.
I just read a very interesting article by Stuart Taylor from the National Journal about this issue, and I would like, Mr. Chairman, to make this a part of the record, this article, if I could.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection. Senator DEWINE. Mr. Taylor describes the opinions of a, quote, ’’right-wing jurist.’’ This judge has consistently ruled against minorities, striking down affirmative action programs, making it harder for victims of race and gender discrimination to vindicate their rights. Chairman SPECTER. Senator DeWine, your unanimous consent request is granted. Senator DEWINE. Thank you, sir. This judge has struck down a Federal law to protect kids from guns, ruled that State and local governments cannot be sued under the Fair Labor Standards Act, leaving 4.7 million workers without a remedy in court. This judge has immunized the President from suit, even when he illegally wiretaps political opponents. This judge approved a police officer’s fatal shooting in the back of an unarmed 15-year-old African-American boy. Finally, this judge has called abortion, and I quote, ‘‘morally repugnant’’ and declared Roe v. Wade to be on, quote, ‘‘on a collision course with itself.’’ Based on such a record, no right-thinking Democrat could ever support such a judge. But as Taylor tells us, this judge is none other than Sandra Day O’Connor, the same Sandra Day O’Connor who has been praised for the past few days as a model of moderation. Judge, the point Mr. Taylor made is clear. You can distort and misrepresent anyone’s record, and that, I believe, unfortunately, is what some of your opponents are doing to you. It is unfair, it is inaccurate, and it is just flat-out wrong. Second, I would like to respond to the allegation that you have not written an opinion in favor of plaintiff alleging race discrimination on the job. You did a very good job a moment ago when Senator Kyl was talking to you in describing some of these cases. I think the facts of these cases are what is particularly interesting. In Reynolds v. USX Corporation, you ruled that an African-American woman whose coworkers and supervisors regularly made racial and sexual slurs against her and denied her training opportunities was, in fact, entitled to $124,000 in damages and in attorney fees. In Zubi v. AT&T Corporation, you dissented. You dissented, arguing against a stringent limitations period which prevented a civil rights plaintiff from filing a claim, and your position was vindicated. You were vindicated by the United States Supreme Court unanimously a few years later. In Smith v. Davis, you disagreed with the district court, which had dismissed an African-American employee’s claim of discrimination. Instead, you found that there was evidence to support a find-

388
ing that the employer’s stated reasons for firing the plaintiff were not genuine.
In Goosby v. Johnson & Johnson, you ruled that the plaintiff, an African-American woman, was entitled to a trial under claims of employment discrimination because you found that there was evidence that the employer was treating white male employees differently than it was treating the plaintiff. There are more cases, as you have testified to, but I think we make the point.
We would all be better off and this process, Mr. Chairman, would be better off and would be more instructive if we could evaluate your nomination, Judge, based on your full and complete record.
Finally, let me add my two cents on this Vanguard issue. I am going to take it from a little different perspective than has been done so far. To me, this is really a non-issue. In the so-called Vanguard lawsuit, two people were in a financial dispute. The plaintiff sued to force the defendant to turn over $170,000 held by him in some Vanguard accounts. The defendant went to court to prevent Vanguard from turning over the money.
Now, while Vanguard was technically part of the suit and was technically a defendant, it wasn’t really a defendant in any sense of the term that would be used by the public or understood by the public. It was not accused of any wrongdoing, it didn’t stand to lose anything.
Really, the only question was whether Vanguard would transfer some of the funds it held for one person over to another. It was simply being asked, who do I pay the money to, who do I give the money to. That is all Vanguard was being asked to do, so nothing in the classic sense of being a defendant. Nothing about this case could realistically have affected Vanguard as a company, let alone affected your mutual fund. It is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is absurd, and everybody on this panel knows that.
Now, for the sake of the process, I hope we can put these issues behind us. This hearing is really our opportunity to fully and fairly evaluate your qualifications for the High Court and to get some idea about how you think as a judge, how you process things, what kind of a judge you will be on the United States Supreme Court.
Now, let me turn to the substance. Judge Alito, I want to turn to an issue that is very important to me. In a number of recent cases, the Supreme Court of this country has restricted congressional power in a way that I think is not required by the Constitution.
In my opening statement, I mentioned the Supreme Court’s decision in Board of Trustees v. Garrett, a five-to-four decision. To me, that case is the best example of this recent trend, and it is not a good trend, in my opinion.
Garrett involved a woman who claimed that she had been discriminated against because she was disabled. She was employed by the State of Alabama and she sued the State under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Supreme Court threw out the suit, however, holding that Congress lacked the power to make the State subject to suit.
Now, Judge, as I see it, the problem with Garrett is that the Court ignored findings made by Congress. While we were considering the ADA, we held 13 hearings and even set up a task force
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00400 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

389
that held hearings in every State in the Union, attended by more than 30,000 individuals. Based on these hearings, we found hundreds of examples, hundreds of examples of people with disabilities being discriminated against by the States in employment decisions.
Further, we found that, and I quote, ‘‘Two-thirds of all disabled Americans between the ages of 16 and 64 were not working at all, even though a large majority of them were capable of doing so.’’ And, finally, we found that this discrimination flowed from, and I quote, ‘‘stereotypic assumptions about people with disabilities,’’ as well as, and I quote, ‘‘purposeful unequal treatment,’’ end of quote. Sadly, however, in Garrett the Court said that this was just not enough. In fact, it held that we had not pointed to any evidence that the States discriminated in employment decisions against people with disabilities.
Judge Alito, from a review of your decisions, it appears to me that you tended to defer in close cases to the decisions of those individuals closest to the problem at hand. I applaud you for taking that approach.
Now, let me ask you, in your opinion, what role should a judge play when reviewing congressional fact-finding, and how can you assure us that you will show appropriate deference to the role of Congress as the representatives of the people in this democracy when we pass important legislation?
Judge ALITO. I think that the judiciary should have great respect for findings of fact that are made by Congress. And in the Rybar decision that I was discussing earlier, although it is controversial and it involved an application of the Lopez decision, I stated that that decision would have been very different from—that case would have been very different for me if Congress had made findings, and that is because of two things.
I am fully aware of the fact that the members of the judiciary are not the only officers in the United States who take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. Members of Congress take an oath to support the Constitution and officers of the Executive branch take an oath to support the Constitution, and I presume that they go about their work in good faith.
The second point—and this goes directly to the issue of findings—is that the judiciary is not equipped at all to make findings about what is going on in the real world, not this sort of legislative findings. And Congress, of course, is in the best position to do that. You have constituents. Members of Congress hear from their constituents. Congress can have hearings and examine complex social issues, receive statistical data, hear testimony from experts, analyze that and synthesize that and reduce that to findings. And when Congress makes findings on questions that have a bearing on the constitutionality of legislation, I think they are entitled to great respect.
Senator DEWINE. Well, Judge, I appreciate your response. We can’t ask you, obviously, to decide any particular case, but what we are trying to do today is get a general idea of how you approach cases. And we have, as I said, looked at your previous cases. We have a good idea from that, but I appreciate this exchange.
Let me followup with this. Garrett is the law of the land today. Nonetheless, let me ask you whether, after Garrett, Congress might
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00401 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

390
still have a way to protect the disabled. Rather than focus on the problem caused by Garrett, let me focus on the solution. To me, even after Garrett, Congress still has the power to protect the disabled under the Spending Clause of the Constitution. I would like to explore maybe that with you, if I could. Let me give you an example of how this might work.
You, of course, are very familiar with South Dakota v. Dole. In that case, Congress had wanted to establish a national drinking age of 21. As you know, we, of course, don’t have the power to require that under our Constitution. Therefore, Congress used its power under the Spending Clause. We said to the States, if you don’t establish a 21-year-old drinking age, you will lose 5 percent of your Federal highway dollars.
This left the States with a choice: adopt a 21-year-old drinking age or lose 5 percent of their Federal money. When presented with such a choice, the States kept the money and changed their drinking age to 21. It seems to me that Congress might be able to use this same approach to require the States to waive their immunity from suit under statutes like the ADA.
Judge, based on your experience, could you give me your understanding of what Congress can do and what it can’t do under its Spending Clause power, maybe just go back and look at some recent cases and give me a little—
Judge ALITO. Yes, certainly, Senator. Well, I think you have pointed to the leading case in this area, and that is South Dakota v. Dole. South Dakota v. Dole recognizes that Congress has broad powers under the Spending Clause, and that when Congress provides money to the States, Congress can attach conditions to that money, to the receipt of the money, provided that certain standards are met.
One thing that has to be done under the Supreme Court’s cases is that there has to be a clear statement that the conditions are attached to the receipt of the money. And the Supreme Court views this like a contract, so that the parties need to have—the party receiving the notice has to have clear and fair notice about what it is agreeing to by taking the money. And then beyond that, the condition—if that is satisfied, then the condition has to be germane to the purposes of the funds.
And in South Dakota v. Dole, the Court found that the drinking age and the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit were germane to the purpose of the expenditures, and these, I believe, were Federal highway funds. So those are the standards that would be applied to any future legislation under the current precedents if the future legislation invokes Congress’s broad power under the Spending Clause.
Senator DEWINE. That is helpful. Thank you, Judge. During the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts, Chairman Specter showed us a chart stating that the Supreme Court had the opportunity to overrule Roe v. Wade in 38 cases. Because of this, the Chairman suggested that Roe was not only super precedent, but super duper precedent. The Chairman has made the same argument at the hearing today. In fact, he brought the chart out again today. Now, Judge, just to show you that not all members of this panel are like-minded, I want to tell you that I disagree. To me, Roe is
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00402 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

391
not super precedent. I believe Roe is a precedent, but I don’t believe it is super duper precedent or super precedent.
First, although the Court has applied Roe in 38 cases, it has not directly taken up the issue of whether to overrule Roe in every one of those cases. In fact, out of those 38 cases, I have only found 4 in which the Court directly addressed the status of Roe as binding precedent.
In Webster, the Court asked whether Roe should be reaffirmed, but ultimately avoided the issue. In three cases—City of Akron, Thornburgh and Casey—the Court did reaffirm Roe. But the last of these, Casey, did so in a way that hardly left Roe on firm footing. In fact, Casey altered Roe by eliminating the strict scrutiny standard of review and replacing it with a lesser undue burden test. The result has been that many restrictions on abortion have been upheld.
Second, just because Roe has been applied and reaffirmed does not make it a special form of precedent. Many other cases have been applied for decades before eventually being overruled. For example, Plessy v. Ferguson, the case establishing the principle of separate but equal, was upheld for nearly 60 years before it was overruled, and certainly discredited today.
Lochner v. New York, a case that greatly limited the power of the States to protect children and workers, was consistently applied for more than 30 years before it was overruled. And Swift v. Tyson, a case establishing the doctrine of Federal common law, was a bedrock principle of American law repeatedly applied and upheld for nearly 100 years before it too was struck down. Thus, the mere fact that Roe has been upheld for more than 30 years does not mean that it is entitled to special deference.
Third, from the start, Roe has been criticized by lawyers, scholars and judges, whether Democrats or Republicans and, to date, it does remain controversial.
Fourth, much has happened over the last 30 years to undermine the soundness of Roe. Senator Brownback has mentioned how the facts of Roe have changed. We now know that the plaintiff in Roe based her case on false statements and that she wants the case overturned. We also know much about the life of babies in utero that we did not know 30 years ago.
We even know something about the internal deliberations of the Justices who decided Roe. In an internal Supreme Court memo, Justice Harry Blackmun, the author of Roe, acknowledged that the trimester framework established in his opinion was, and I quote, ’’arbitrary.’’ And Justice Lewis Powell said that he could not find a right to an abortion within the Constitution and decided instead to rely on his gut.
Finally, whatever the term ‘‘super precedent’’ means, I do not think that it describes Roe. In an article by William Landis and Richard Posner, super precedent was defined this way. It is a, and I quote, ‘‘precedent that is so effective in defining the requirements of the law that it prevents legal decisions arising in the first place, or if they do arise, induces them to be settled without litigation,’’ end of quote. In other words, super precedent is precedent that is so firmly entrenched in our legal system that people simply don’t question it.

392
Marbury v. Madison, the case establishing the power of judicial review, is super precedent. It is so well settled that litigants do not challenge it in court. In fact, it is one of the fundamental assumptions upon which our constitutional system is built. Roe is hardly Marbury. Is Roe Supreme Court precedent? Certainly, but in my view it is not super duper precedent or even super precedent. It is precedent, nothing more.
Judge, I want to turn now to another topic, to an issue that several Federal judges in Ohio have brought up to me during our conversations. As you know, the Supreme Court currently decides about 75 cases a term. This number is down dramatically from where it was just a generation ago. In 1976, for example, the Court decided almost 400 cases on the merits, more than five times what it does today.
This incredible shrinking Supreme Court docket has been the focus of much attention over the past few years, a lot of discussion. One result of the Court deciding fewer and fewer cases is that more and more circuit splits are left unresolved, which is what I want to talk to you about.
As we all know, a circuit split occurs when two or more Federal Courts of Appeals disagree on an issue of Federal law. As of late, circuit splits have become so pervasive that the Seton Hall Law School came out last year with a new Law Review dedicated exclusively to that issue. There is also a website written by a law professor at the University of Richmond, solely committed to identifying new circuit splits. Hardly a week passes when at least one does not emerge.
To me, these pervasive and unaddressed circuit splits create three problems: one, organizations that transact business across State lines, get caught in the cross-hairs of the his confusion, being subject to one interpretation of Federal law in California and a different one in the State of Ohio; second, Federal judges are placed in a difficult situation trying to figure out what the law requires. In fact, a number of Federal judges in Ohio have talked to me, as I said, about this; and finally, circuit splits undermine the goal of having uniformity in our Federal law.
Let me just ask what is your opinion about this issue? In your experience has the Supreme Court’s shrinking docket caused problems for businesses, lower court judges, individuals? Is there a problem with the number of unresolved circuit splits? And if the Court takes more cases, do you think that will solve the problem?
Judge ALITO. Well, that’s a difficult issue for me to address from my current position as a judge of a court of appeals because the Supreme Court is my boss, and I am reluctant to suggest that I think they should be doubling their workload.
[Laughter.] Senator DEWINE. Oh, go ahead. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. That’s not the sort of—or even increasing it at all. That’s not the sort of thing that subordinates generally do regarding superiors. But circuit splits are certainly undesirable, and I think everybody recognizes that, and that’s one of the grounds for granting certiorari. I know that when Justice White was on the Court he regularly would dissent from denial of certiorari in cases
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00404 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

where there was a circuit split because he felt strongly that circuit splits should be resolved by the Supreme Court.
I have friends, former colleagues from prior times in my career, who are appellate attorneys who specialize in cases before the Supreme Court and in appellate litigation generally, and occasionally I hear them complain about unresolved circuit splits that are difficult for their clients. So I’m aware of their complaints.
I haven’t personally kept track of the number of circuit splits that exist, but certainly they are undesirable thing, and it is a ground for granting certiorari, and I think one of the jobs that the Supreme Court has is to iron out circuit splits. There can be disagreements about whether there really is a circuit split, obviously, in a particular case, and there can be differences of opinion about the timing for resolving circuit splits. Sometimes the Supreme Court thinks it’s advisable to wait and see how an issue plays out in a number of circuits before the Supreme Court decides to take on the issue, and that may improve their ability to resolve the issue when the case generally—when the case eventually comes before them.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, let me suggest that I think it is a problem and I think the Supreme Court needs to deal with it. Chief Justice Roberts indicated that he thought the Court could take on more, and I would suggest that they could. I appreciate your comments.
Judge Alito, let me ask you about Congress’s power to protect our children from the proliferation of pornography on the Internet. This is an important issue. I raised it at the last hearing. It is one that I think is very troubling. Congress has tried several times to protect our children from being exposed to pornography on the Internet. In 1996, we passed the Communications Decency Act, but the Supreme Court struck it down, citing the First Amendment. A few years later we passed the Child Online Protection Act. Again, the Court struck it down.
What bothers me about these cases is they fail to account for something that to me seems relatively simple. At the core of the First Amendment is the protection of political speech, but it seems to me that pornography is altogether different. Unlike political speech, pornography has very little value if it has any value at all. It does not communicate a message other than one that degrades women. It does not contribute to the public debate, and actually causes harm to the victims who take part in making it, and those who use it.
There are, of course, a number of cases that seem to recognize that pornography is of lesser value speech. In Young v. American Mini Theaters the Court upheld zoning regulations on adult theaters. In doing so, Justice Stevens had this to say, and I quote, ‘‘Even though we recognize that the First Amendment will not tolerate the total suppression of erotic materials that have some arguably artistic value, it is manifest that society’s interest in protecting this type of expression is of a wholly different and lesser magnitude than the interest and untrammeled political debate.’’
Let me ask you, Judge, what is your thinking on this subject? Is pornography lesser value speech, as Justice Stevens has seemed to
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00405 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

394
suggest, and are there, or should there be, different levels of speech under the First Amendment?
Judge ALITO. I think that the problem of protecting children from pornography on the Internet illustrates the fact that although the task of the judiciary is to apply principles that are in the Constitution and not make up its own principles, to apply those to different factual situations when the world changes, and in particular, in the First Amendment context, when means of communication changes. The job of applying the principles that have been worked out—and I think in this area worked out with a great deal of effort over a period of time—in the pre-Internet world, applying those to the world of the Internet is a really difficult problem, and I understand it. Congress has been struggling with it, and I know the judiciary has been struggling with it.
The law, of course, as you know, constitutional law draws a distinction between obscenity, which has no First Amendment protection but is subject to a very strict definition, and pornography, which is not obscenity but is sexually related materials, with respect to minors, the Supreme Court has said that it’s permissible for a State to regulate the sale of pornography to minors, has greater authority there. I think that’s the Ginsburg case. It has greater authority there than it does with respect to the distribution of pornography to adults.
Now, in the pre-Internet world, the job of preventing minors from purchasing pornography was a lot simpler. If they wanted to get it, I guess they would have to go to a store or some place and buy it. But on the Internet, of course, it’s readily available from any computer terminal, and a lot of minors today are a lot more sophisticated in the use of computers than their parents, so the ability of parents to monitor what they’re doing and supervise what they’re doing is greatly impaired by this difference in computer aptitude. I can’t say much more about the question than that. It is a difficult question. I think that there needs to be additional effort in this area, probably by all branches of Government so that the law fully takes into account the differences regarding communication over the Internet and access to materials over the Internet by minors.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, I have one last question. If confirmed to the Supreme Court, only part of your job will be hearing arguments and issuing opinions. An equally important part of the job will involve deciding which cases to hear in the first place. Each year the Supreme Court receives approximately 8,000 petitions for cert., cert. petitions, as they are called. These are petitions by a party to a lawsuit asking the Court to hear its case. Out of these 8,000 annual requests, the Court decides to hear only about 75 to 80. For many years individual Justices would review each cert. petition and cast a vote on whether to hear the case. Today, however, eight of the Justices are part of what is called the cert. pool. Here is how it works. All petitions are put into a pool. A single law clerk then picks up a petition, writes a memo recommending for or against hearing the case. That memo is then circulated to the eight Justices in the cert. pool who use it to cast their vote on whether to hear the case. Justice Stevens is the only one who does not participate in this pool. Instead he has his staff prepare a memo on
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00406 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

395
each case with a recommendation tailored to his own thinking on an issue. It would seem to me that the cert. pool greatly limits the exchange of ideas among members of the Court.
I wonder if you could tell me how you would intend to proceed, if you are going to use the pool or if you are going to do what Justice Stevens does, or if you have thought about it.
Judge ALITO. I have—I’m aware of the issue, but I have not thought past what might happen with these confirmation proceedings. So it’s not the kind of issue that I have really thought through in my mind. If I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed, I think I would assess the situation at that time and talk to the Supreme Court Justices and see what their views are, the reasons why they’re proceeding in one way or another.
I know from my perspective as a lower court judge, that there is a constant conflict between the obligation that we have to deal with a very heavy caseload and the need for the judge, as opposed to a law clerk or a staff employee of the Court to deal with the cases. We cannot delegate our judicial responsibility, but we do need to call on—we need to find ways, and we do find ways, of using—of obtaining assistance from clerks and staff, employees, so that we can deal with the large caseload that we have.
Senator DEWINE. Thank you, Judge. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator DeWine. Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Judge. Because Sandra Day O’Connor was the fifth vote on both Lopez and Morrison, I think I would like to start with the Commerce Clause, and your views of federalism. Do you agree with the direction the Supreme Court took in Lopez? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator that really relates to the next case in the Lopez-Morrison line of cases that might come before the Supreme Court, and so I don’t know how I can address that question without knowing what that case is, and of course, my resolution of it would— Senator FEINSTEIN. I was just asking you about Lopez, but— Judge ALITO. Well, Lopez is— Senator FEINSTEIN [continuing]. If you do not want to answer, that is OK. Judge ALITO. Lopez is a precedent of the Court, and it’s been followed in Morrison, and then it has to be considered within connection with the Supreme Court’s decision in Raich, and I think that all three of those have to be taken into account together. I don’t think there’s any question at this point in our history that Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause is quite broad, and I think that reflects a number of things, including the way in which our economy and our society has developed, and all of the foreign and intrastate activity that takes place, we do still have a Federal system of Government, and I think most people believe that that is the system that’s set up by our Constitution. Senator FEINSTEIN. Having said that, I pulled the Rybar case and read it over the noon break. Let me just see if we agree on the facts, and stop me if you think I am misquoting or misstating anything. The Rybar case essentially took place the year after Lopez. It involved Mr. Rybar, who was a federally licensed gun dealer who

went to a gun show in Pennsylvania and bought a Chinese type 54, 7.62-millimeter submachine gun one day, sold it to Mr. Baublitz, went back the next day and sold him a military M–3, 45 caliber submachine gun. The grand jury indicted him on two counts of unlawful possession of a machine gun in violation of the law, and two counts of unlawful transfer of an unregistered firearm. He changed his plea, pled guilty to two counts. I think he pled conditionally guilty to two counts.
When the case came before you, and I read with great interest your dissenting opinion, you said, and I quote, ‘‘If Lopez, which happened the year before, does not govern this case, then it may well be a precedent that’s strictly limited to its own peculiar circumstances, but our responsibility is to apply Supreme Court precedent. That responsibility, it seems to me, requires us to invalidate the statutory provision at issue here in its present form.’’
And then you went on to say that the present form ‘‘might be sustainable in its current form if Congress made findings that the purely intrastate possession of machine guns has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, or if Congress or the Executive assembled empirical evidence documenting such a link. If, as the Government and the majority boldly insist, the purely intrastate possession of machine guns has such an effect, these steps are not too much to demand to protect our system of constitutional federalism.’’
So if I understand this, you essentially said that you wanted to follow precedent, newly established law in this area, and you left a little hedge that if the Congress did make findings in that law, then that might be a different situation. If Congress did make findings, would you have agreed that that statute would have been constitutional?
Judge ALITO. Well, what I said in the opinion and what I will reiterate this afternoon is that it would have been a very different case for me. I don’t think I can express an opinion on how I would have decided a hypothetical case.
Senator FEINSTEIN. It is not hypothetical. I am just asking you if there were findings, as you said, you might have sustained the law—
Judge ALITO. And I read it like that. I think it would have been—
Senator FEINSTEIN. I am just asking you, would you have sustained the law for findings—
Judge ALITO. I don’t think that I can give you a definitive answer to the question because that involves a case that’s different from the case that came before me. But I repeat what I said there, it would have been a very different matter if Congress had made findings. I have the greatest respect for findings. This is an area where Congress has the expertise and where Congress has the opportunity to assemble facts and to assess the facts. We on the appellate judiciary don’t have that opportunity. So if Congress had made findings—and I didn’t insist on findings. If the Executive branch, which was defending the statute, had pointed to testimony at hearings—and that’s been done in other Commerce Clause cases—or statements by responsible Government officials with expertise in the area of firearms control, or any other evidence that

substantiated this, it would have been a very different case for me, and of course, if there had been a jurisdictional element, then I think it’s perfectly clear under the precedents that it would have been constitutional.
Senator FEINSTEIN. I accept that with one exception. I think most people know that guns, particularly machine guns, do affect interstate commerce, and there is generally no question about that. With one look at the gun trace, even before Mr. Rybar had the gun, the likelihood was that it came across State lines, particularly the Chinese model. So I think that is a difficult extrapolation for me to understand, but that is not necessarily dispositive.
Let me go on. At the conclusion of your dissent, you wrote that, ‘‘Even today, the normative case for federalism remains strong.’’ Now, federalism is often used to describe the strengthening of State powers at the expense of the Federal Government. What exactly did you mean by that statement?
Judge ALITO. I meant that there are activities that—and I think there is general agreement on this, and it goes beyond what the Constitution requires into areas of policy that I think Congress respects. I think there is general agreement that there are some activities that have traditionally been handled by the States and by local governments. Those are areas in which they have taken the lead because the view has been that they are in the best position to deal with that. And that was the issue that was directly addressed by Justice Kennedy’s concurrence in Lopez. He relied in large part on the fact that—he put heavy reliance on the fact that what was involved in Lopez was a law relating to schools. And although the Federal Government certainly has a role in education, traditionally that has been regarded as something that is primarily to be handled at the State and local level.
Senator FEINSTEIN. OK. Now, you cited a law review article by a professor named Stephen Calabrese. In that article, he argues that Lopez was a revolution that shattered forever the notion that after 50 years of Commerce Clause precedent, we could never go back to the days of limited national power. Do you agree with that?
Judge ALITO. I agree that Lopez was a startling development for a lot of people. When I was in law school, I think the traditional wisdom was that the commerce power reached everything, that there was no limit to the power, that nothing could ever exceed the power. And Lopez and the Lopez line of cases have not made huge inroads on that principle, but it was the first time in a long time that a statute had been held to exceed Congress’s commerce power. So to that extent, yes, it was a revolution, but how big of a one—
Senator FEINSTEIN. See, I would say not yet has it made that kind of a dent, and that is why your nomination is so important, because you could be a decisive vote in this area.
Do you believe that the Supreme Court’s Commerce Clause decisions in the 50 years preceding Lopez are settled law?
Judge ALITO. I think that—I’d have to talk about individual cases, but I do think most of those are—the ones that come to my mind I think are well-settled precedents.
Senator FEINSTEIN. OK. Now, unlike the machine gun law in Rybar, the Family and Medical Leave Act in Chittister did include

398
congressional findings of fact, as the Supreme Court confirmed, and yet you authored the majority opinion to invalidate the law.
Judge ALITO. Well, in Chittister— Senator FEINSTEIN. Do you see a contradiction in that? Judge ALITO. I don’t, Senator. I don’t believe that there were congressional findings in Chittister that went to the issue in Chittister. Senator FEINSTEIN. OK. That is good. Now, let me ask you some questions. Is it enough for Congress to provide findings of fact in a statute, or do the findings of fact need to be deemed sufficient by a court? Judge ALITO. Well, what the Supreme Court has said is that findings of fact are very helpful when they are provided. And the Court will certainly treat them with respect. But they are neither— they are not necessarily definitive, and they also are not necessary. Congress doesn’t have to make findings. It is helpful when it does it, and under the Supreme Court’s cases, the findings are not necessarily definitive. That is what the Supreme Court has said about this. Senator FEINSTEIN. Yes, but you struck down Rybar. Essentially, you said it would have a much better chance with you if it had findings of fact. And this was a case where prior laws had major findings of fact with respect to machine guns. I mean, this wasn’t a new thing. Judge ALITO. Senator, I looked very carefully at all of the materials that were cited by the other judges in Rybar and that were provided by the Government. And the things that were cited from the legislative history of the prior statutes did not, in my view, go to the issue in Rybar. All of those prior statutes were statutes that had jurisdictional elements in them. All that I was looking for was some evidence that the possession of a machine gun—not the transfer of a machine gun or the sale of a machine gun, but the mere possession had a substantial effect on interstate commerce. That is what I understood the Supreme Court precedent to require. And it is not a very heavy burden to show that something has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but that is what I understood the Supreme Court precedent to require and that is what I was looking for. Senator FEINSTEIN. OK. Let’s move to the issue of a woman’s right to choose and Roe. This morning, Senator Specter talked about how Casey reaffirmed the original soundness of Roe and then put emphasis on precedent. And he then asked, ‘‘How would you weigh that consideration were this issue to come before you, if confirmed? ’’ And in response, you said, and I would like to quote, ‘‘Well, I agree that in every case in which there is prior precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare decisis, and the presumption is that the Court will follow its prior precedents. There needs to be a special justification for overruling a prior precedent.’’ Can you give us a few examples of a special justification, not including Brown v. Board of Education, which you think would qualify? Judge ALITO. There are a number of factors that figure in the application of stare decisis in particular cases. There are factors that weigh in favor of stare decisis, and there are factors that weigh against stare decisis. Factors that weigh in favor of stare decisis are

399
things like what the initial vote was on the case, the length of time that the case has been on the book, whether it has been reaffirmed, whether it has been reaffirmed on stare decisis grounds, whether there has been reliance, the nature and the extent of the reliance, whether the precedent has proven to be workable. Those are all factors that have to be considered on an individual basis.
Senator FEINSTEIN. But I am asking you what the special justification would be, that you mentioned this morning, to overcome precedence and reliance?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think what needs to be done is a consideration of all of the factors that are relevant. This is not a mathematical formula. It would be a lot easier for everybody if it were. But it is not. The Supreme Court has said that this is a question that calls for the exercise of judgment. They have said there has to be a special justification for overruling a precedent. There is a presumption that precedents will be followed. But it is not—the rule of stare decisis is not an inexorable command, and I don’t think anybody would want a rule in the area of constitutional law that pointed in that—that said that a constitutional decision, once handed down, can never be overruled.
So it’s a matter of weighing all of the—taking into account all of the factors and seeing whether there is a strong case based on all the relevant—
Senator FEINSTEIN. My question was a different one, respectfully. Judge ALITO. I am sorry, Senator. Senator FEINSTEIN. It was, can you give me a few examples of what you think would qualify as a special justification for overruling prior precedent? And the reason I ask you this is in our private conversation, you said to me that you did not think there had been any case you could think of that had been more tested than Roe. Judge ALITO. Well, Roe has—sorry. Senator FEINSTEIN. What special circumstance would there be which would overcome this kind—whether you call it super precedent or super duper or anything, but this kind of protracted testing over a 33-year period of time? Judge ALITO. Senator, I’m sorry if I didn’t understand your question previously. One situation in which there is a special justification for overruling a precedent is if the rule has proven to be unworkable. An example where the Supreme Court thought that a rule had proven to be unworkable is provided by National League of Cities and San Antonio Transit Authority v. Garcia. National League of Cities asked whether something was traditionally a sovereign function. And that resulted in a whole series of cases in the lower courts, a large number of cases in the lower courts, and a number of cases in the Supreme Court in which the courts had to decide whether something was on one side of this line or not, and it proved in the view of the Supreme Court to be a very difficult standard to work with. And, finally, in Garcia, they said this is unworkable, and we are going to overrule National League of Cities, and we are going to leave it to Congress to deal with the federalism issue that is presented here. This is an example of the Supreme Court saying there is a federalism concern here, but it is one that Congress rather than the Court would have to deal with.

Sometimes changes in the situation in the real world can call for the overruling of a precedent. An example of that is provided by Katz v. United States, which I was talking about this morning in relation to wiretapping. The old rule under Olmstead was that in order for there to be a search, you had to look to property law. You had to see whether there was an invasion of a property interest. And then with the development of electronic communications and electronic surveillance, wiretapping or other forms of electronic surveillance, which is what was involved in Katz, the Supreme Court said this isn’t a sensible way to apply the Fourth Amendment principle under the conditions of the modern world, and they said famously that the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. So they shifted—they found the doctrinal underpinnings of the old Olmstead rule to be undermined by developments in the society, and they shifted the focus from property law to whether somebody had an expectation of privacy.
So those are examples. Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, and you did say that you believe the Constitution provides a right of privacy. Judge ALITO. I did say that. The 14th Amendment protects liberty. The Fifth Amendment protects liberty. And I think it is well accepted that this has a substantive component, and that that component includes aspects of privacy that have constitutional protection. Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me ask you about your dissent in Casey. You reasoned that most women seeking abortions are either unmarried or would tell their husbands and, therefore, few would be harmed if spousal notification was required. Justice O’Connor, on the other hand, ruled, and I quote, ‘‘The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.’’ Why did you propose a different approach than Justice O’Connor? Judge ALITO. Well, I mentioned the fact in my opinion that this provision applied only to married women, but I don’t think that was really the focus of what I was getting at. I think—and I agree with her that you look at the group that’s affected, not the group that’s unaffected, and the standard that she had—so that would be women who fell within this provision of the Pennsylvania law. And the standard that she had articulated in the earlier cases was, as I described it a couple of minutes ago, that an undue burden in her view had to be an absolute obstacle or an extreme obstacle, and it could not be simply something that inhibited some women. The ‘‘some women’’ phrase was her phrase, not my phrase. Senator FEINSTEIN. Now, I am going to ask you about one other quote that some of my colleagues may disagree with what Justice O’Connor said, but she said it, and that is, ‘‘The State may not give to a man the kind of dominion and control over his wife that parents exercise over their children.’’ Do you agree with that? Judge ALITO. I never equated the situation of an adult woman who fell within the notification provision of the Pennsylvania statute with the situation of a minor who was required to provide notice. There is an analogy, and the earlier case that Justice O’Connor had decided, the Hodgson case, was a minor notification stat-

ute. But I think I made it quite clear in my opinion that this was nothing more than an analogy and that there was no close—these situations were very distinct, and I was aware of that, and I think I pointed that out.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me move on, if I might. One of the core principles of Roe is that a woman’s health must be protected. In Casey, Justice O’Connor specifically wrote that after viability, the State may, if it chooses, regulate and even proscribe abortion, except where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life of the mother. This requirement to protect a woman’s health was also reaffirmed in Stenberg v. Carhart, where it was said the Court rejects Nebraska’s contention that there is no need for health exception.
Do you agree, if the statute restricts access to abortion, that it must protect the health of the mother in order for it to be constitutional?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think that the case law is very clear about protecting the life and the health of the mother is the compelling interest throughout pregnancy. I think that’s very clear in the case law.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. I appreciate that. In 1985, at the time you wrote the strategy memo on Thornburgh, the Court had already held in Roe, Akron, and eventually 30 other cases, that a woman had a constitutional right to choose whether to continue a pregnancy. In addition, in your memo, you specifically wrote that in the Akron case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed Roe. However, despite this, your memo outlined a strategy to eventually overturn Roe. My question is a little different from what you discussed somewhat yesterday. What was your view of precedent at the time you wrote that memo? Judge ALITO. Well, I think there are two things that I should say in response to that. The first is that I did not advocate in the memo that an argument be made that Roe be overruled, and therefore, the whole issue, had the Government proceeded with the argument that I recommended, the issue of stare decisis wouldn’t have been presented and so there wasn’t any occasion for me to talk about stare decisis in the memo and I did not talk about it. I think there’s a mention of it in a footnote. So I didn’t address it and there wasn’t an occasion to address it. The second thing I would say is that stare decisis is a concern for the judiciary much more than it is for an advocate. An advocate is trying to achieve a result, and so an advocate is—for an advocate, stare decisis can be either a great benefit if it is in your favor or an obstacle to get over. But it isn’t the kind of issue that needs to be grappled with in the way in which a court has to grapple with stare decisis. Senator FEINSTEIN. OK. In Casey, you wrote about the harms caused by spousal notification to the practical effect that the law will not amount to an undue burden unless the effect is greater than the burden imposed on minors. Just to go back to that, is this what you meant? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I don’t—I do not equate the situation of a married woman with the situation of a minor—
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00413 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

402
Senator FEINSTEIN. I know you keep saying that, but I keep going back to the words and they seem to say something else.
Judge ALITO. Well, I think if you look at the words, I actually said that I don’t equate these two situations. I was mindful of the fact that they are very different situations. But often, the law proceeds on the basis—legal reasoning is based on analogy, and so if you take a situation that’s quite different and yet has some relationship to a situation that comes up later, you can draw some analogies while still recognizing that the two situations are very different.
If you’re talking about the potential for abuse, that certainly is something that can come up in either of these two contexts and it’s a tragedy in either context. If a single minor is abused as a result of notification, that’s a tragedy. If a single adult woman is abused as a result of notification, it’s a tragedy.
But what I think I’m getting at there is that this is what we had. This is what I had. This was the information that I had to work with to try to understand what this provision meant. And so you work with what you’ve got and that’s what I had and I was trying to see to what degree the prior situation was relevant and to what degree it wasn’t relevant to the issue that was before me.
Senator FEINSTEIN. I’d like to quickly just switch subjects for a moment just to clarify something you said this morning, and this has to do with electronic surveillance of Americans. As you know, in 1978, the Congress, after a lot of introspection, passed a bill called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which we call FISA, which essentially set up the parameters for all electronic surveillance within the United States. It’s very specific, if you read it. There is a great concern right now because of what’s been happening with respect to electronic surveillance, quite possibly involving Americans as well as foreigners.
You said something interesting this morning. You said, generally, there has to be a warrant issued by a neutral and detached magistrate before a search can be carried out. Now, with respect to the FISA law, Senator Birch Bayh, the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee at the time, spells out in the Committee Report that this covers all surveillance in the United States. And then President Carter, when he signed the law, said this covers all surveillance within the United States. So there is a burgeoning question as to whether the President now has the authority to wiretap Americans without going to the FISA court.
When you said, generally, there has to be a warrant, what that said to me was you were providing for an exception. Is that correct? Are you providing for an exception?
Judge ALITO. I think that what I was addressing when I said that was what the Fourth Amendment means, the general principle that is set out in the Fourth Amendment, and the case law under the Fourth Amendment says that a warrant is generally required, but there are well-recognized situations in which a search can be carried out without a warrant. Exigent circumstances is a situation that comes immediately to mind if—
Senator FEINSTEIN. Well, let me stop you here. Do you recognize Justice Jackson’s comment in the 1952 steel case where he set up that tripartite framework—

403
Judge ALITO. I do— Senator FEINSTEIN [continuing]. Of Presidential authority and when it is at its weakest is when Congress has legislated? And in 1978, Congress did legislate and covered the horizon, so to speak? Judge ALITO. Yes, Senator, I recognize that and I think that’s a very useful framework for addressing issues of Executive power. Now, there is a question about what the meaning of what Congress did, and that would be a statutory question. What is the meaning of the provision of FISA in question, and maybe there’s no substantial argument about what was meant there, but maybe there would be an issue about what was meant there, and certainly there could be an issue about the meaning of the authorization on the use of military force. How far was that intended to go? And so the statutory question, I think, would—that certainly would be an issue that could come up in this situation and probably you would need to—I think you would have to resolve the statutory question before you could figure out which of the three categories that Justice Jackson set out the case fell into. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. I’ve run out of time. I’ll continue this next session. Thank you. Judge ALITO. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We’ve got a good hearing, I believe. A lot of exchanges have occurred. I will agree with Senator Biden. I can’t remember a nominee being this forthcoming. You have gone into more detail about questions that may come up before you without going too far, in my opinion, than we have seen before. You have been very open and I have been very impressed with your analytical spirit and your ability to handle these cases. We need an aggressive hearing. I agree with those who say that questions need to be propounded to the nominee because this is the only chance that, politically, that we will have, that you will ultimately be on the bench for life, unaccountable to the political process. So it is good to ask questions. My concern is similar to that of Senator DeWine, that many of the accusations and allegations are unfounded or distortions are really not fair, and some of the things that have been said about you are not correct. If they were correct, you would not receive the overwhelming support of your colleagues and have that admiration so totally as you do. Judge Alito, we talk about the role of a judge and how you handle cases that come before you. You were asked, what is your opinion on Lopez, and you said, well, I haven’t studied that case precisely, or at least the background of it. I didn’t sit on it. Would you explain to us, as an appellate judge, as you do today, but also even more so as a Supreme Court Justice, how cases come to you and what you should do before you make a decision or express an opinion on the ultimate outcome of a case, why you should be careful and what this great legal system that we have arranges for before a judge makes that final decision? Judge ALITO. Well, certainly, Senator. We have an adversary system and that means that both sides get the opportunity to present

404
their arguments, and we have established judicial procedures and they are time consuming and they are burdensome and maybe some people would say that some of them are old fashioned. But I think they work well and they are designed to make sure that there’s the vigorous presentation of both sides of the issue that is presented in the case at hand, not some abstract issue that might be addressed in a law review article or a broad issue that might be addressed in a piece of legislation, but an actual concrete case, a dispute between real parties that comes before the court. Both sides have the opportunity to present the arguments that they think have a bearing on that case. The judges get the opportunity to read the briefs, and then in—
Senator SESSIONS. Can I interrupt you there? And you are talking about the appellate court.
Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator SESSIONS. There has been a trial with jurors and witnesses and trial judges and those kinds of things that has already occurred. It is now on appeal. No witnesses are being called, but the transcript is available and one side or the other is alleging that they weren’t treated fairly, is that correct? Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator SESSIONS. So you decide whether or not a fair trial occurred. Continue now with the process and how you ultimately come to make a decision. Judge ALITO. Well, we receive briefs and the briefs are well thought out by the attorneys and it provides, if the case is well briefed, a strong presentation of the positions on both sides of the question, and if it’s an issue of great public importance, there may be other people who file briefs, so called friends of the court. On the Supreme Court now these days, they get a lot of those on both sides of many of the big issues that come before them. So that ensures that they have a strong presentation of all the arguments that can be made on both sides of the issue, both sides of the case. The first step in the process would be to read all of those and then there would be an oral argument. At that point, the Justices of the Supreme Court or the judges of my court— Senator SESSIONS. Now, oral argument means the lawyers for each party come and orally argue the case before the court, is that correct? Judge ALITO. That’s right, and— Senator SESSIONS. Now, you should not have made up your mind even at that point, should you? Judge ALITO. You shouldn’t. I think very often, I come into an oral argument with a tentative idea about how the case should be decided. I’ve thought through the issue as much as I can, but my mind is open to the possibility that something will happen during the oral argument or later in my discussion with the other judges that might change my mind. So we have the oral argument and the lawyers will make their presentation. In that situation, I have the opportunity to ask questions, unlike today. That’s a better situation to be in, but it gives me a chance to explore the issues in the case that are troubling to me and I can pose hypotheticals to the lawyers and try to explore how far their arguments go.

405
And after we have the argument, the judges get together in what’s known as the conference. That’s a private meeting when just the judges are present. And we each discuss the case, and very often one of my colleagues will say something that makes me think about the case differently than I did going into the conference. But at the end of the conference, if we’ve all voted, then we exchange our views and we come to a conclusion about how a case should be decided.
And it’s only at the end of that process that we actually have a vote on the decision, and then somebody is given the job of writing an opinion and sometimes things even change during the opinion writing process. There have been numerous cases in which I’ve had the opinion and I’ve been given the job of writing an opinion to affirm and in the process of—or the reverse, and in the process of writing the opinion, I see that the position that I had previously was wrong. I changed my mind. And then I will write to the other members of the panel and I will say, I have thought this through and this is what I discovered and now I think we should do the opposite of what we agreed, and sometimes they’ll agree with me and sometimes they won’t.
So it’s a long process and it’s only at the end of that whole process that I think a judge is in the position, when the opinion is actually going to be issued, the judge is in the position to say, now I’ve done everything I can with this and this is how I analyze the issue.
Senator SESSIONS. And you said in your opening statement that one of the habits that a good judge should develop is the habit of delaying reaching conclusions until everything has been considered, and I suppose that’s why you would be somewhat reluctant to express an opinion on Lopez or Bush v. Gore or some of these other great decisions, because you would know before you rendered such an important decision in a case like that that you’ve given it the most thorough analysis and you’ve read all the briefs and considered all the arguments of the parties involved, is that correct?
Judge ALITO. That’s an important part of the legal process. If anybody has sat on a jury, they’ve probably been instructed by the judge not to reach any conclusions about the case until they’ve heard all the evidence, not to reach premature conclusions, and judges have the same obligation. Now, it doesn’t mean you don’t think about things. You do think about them, but you don’t reach your final conclusion until you’ve gone through this entire process.
Senator SESSIONS. You said earlier that no person in this country, no matter how high or powerful, is above the law, and no person is beneath the law. Can you assure us that you have the courage and the determination to rule according to your best and highest judgment of the value of the case, regardless of whether or not the person who appointed you or the Congress who confirmed you or any other political pressures that may fall upon you?
Judge ALITO. I can, Senator. I would do that to the best of my ability. That is what I’ve tried to do on the court of appeals, and if I’m confirmed, that’s what I would do on the Supreme Court.
Senator SESSIONS. I believe you will. That is your reputation. That is what other lawyers say about you. That is what professionals who know you conclude. I think it is an important commitment that you have made to us.

You know, we have arguments about a number of cases and the Rybar case has come up a good bit. It involves the machine gun. I was a United States Attorney, as you were, and I prosecuted machine gun cases for years. The Supreme Court said, on Section 922, there is no jurisdictional element. Now, historically, criminal statutes of Federal law have jurisdictional elements. The most common statutes historically that were prosecuted were interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles. It is not a stolen motor vehicle, it is the interstate transportation that makes it a Federal crime, or the interstate transportation of a stolen property, or kidnapping. Kidnapping within a State is not a Federal crime, it is only kidnapping that goes interstate.
So I guess I would ask you to explain for those who may be listening today what this historical procedure is that requires a jurisdictional element of an interstate nexus for the Federal Government to be able to prosecute a crime in some State or county in America.
Judge ALITO. Yes, Senator. Certainly. Well, let me start with the Constitution. The Constitution gives the legislative branch certain powers, and they’re enumerated in the Constitution. One of those powers is the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and a great deal of legislation that Congress passed during the 20th century was regulation that was based on its power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and many of the criminal statutes that Congress has passed, the Federal criminal statutes, are based on Congress’s power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.
So it’s necessary for each of these statutes to fall within this power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, and one of the ways of ensuring that each exercise of this power falls within Congress’s authority under the Commerce Clause is to require that the jurisdictional element be proven in the case. In the case of firearms, as I mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court has said it’s enough to show that the firearm at some point in its history traveled in interstate and foreign commerce, and my experience as a U.S. Attorney and before that as an Assistant U.S. Attorney was that this is not a difficult burden for prosecutors to meet. I can’t recall a case during the time I was U.S. Attorney where anybody expressed the slightest problem with satisfying this. So this is a very simple way of satisfying the interstate commerce element in the case of firearms offenses.
Senator SESSIONS. I couldn’t agree more, and that is what all the traditional firearms laws call for and that is how we proved every case that I prosecuted. I approved it once because it said, ‘‘Made in Italy’’ on the gun. But you prove that the gun has been transported in interstate commerce and that is an element that gives the Federal jurisdiction. As I understand your opinion, you said if the Congress had simply put that in the statute as an element of the offense, then it would have met constitutional muster.
So I guess I would say to my colleagues on the other side and others, maybe we ought to check this law out and write a piece of legislation that puts in the jurisdictional element like all the other historic criminal offenses have and we get this thing done instead of fussing about it. I feel strongly about that.

But when you don’t make it a jurisdictional element, then it is not a matter of proof, is that not right, Judge Alito, and therefore, the defendant does not have all the elements of the case proven beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury that here is the case? That is why it is important.
Judge ALITO. That is correct. Senator SESSIONS. We talked about a lot of these cases. I would just generally like to express my disagreement with those who criticize the Garrett case. It did involve the University of Alabama. I believe that the Attorney General of Alabama was correct to assert that the plaintiff could sue, could get back wages, could get their job back, but under the Sovereign Immunity Doctrine that protects States from lawsuits, that under the way that statute was passed, they could not get money damages against the State of Alabama. I think that was the core issue in it. I also would like to join with Senator DeWine in his very cogent analysis of precedent and super precedent. I think that was insightful for us and would like to be on the record as joining with that. Judge Alito, back 20 years ago, you wrote a memorandum to Solicitor General Charles Fried, who was a law professor, I guess, before he became Solicitor General and went back to Harvard and is there now, a brilliant legal mind. He was the Solicitor General. You worked for him. You submitted a memorandum on a Pennsylvania case, a case that came out of Pennsylvania, and it seemed to me to be a preliminary analysis of that issue and the question of whether or not that case should be—whether the Department of Justice should intervene in that case and file a friend of the court brief. Was it a preliminary overview of the issue and not the final brief or final summary of argument for the appeal? Judge ALITO. And that’s the Thornburgh case that you’re referring to, Senator. Senator SESSIONS. Thornburgh. Judge ALITO. Yes. It wasn’t a brief. It was a memorandum about whether the government should file a brief as a friend of the court. Senator SESSIONS. And you pointed out a number of points in that decision that was being questioned that I thought were—the court had overreached and gone too far. A number of them are quite erroneous, it appeared to me, and you analyzed that very carefully. But before you concluded your argument, you suggested, and not suggested, you stated that you did not think a frontal assault on Roe v. Wade would be appropriate, is that correct? Judge ALITO. Yes, that’s correct. Senator SESSIONS. And was it not the position of President Reagan and the Attorney General of the United States at that time that Roe v. Wade was wrongfully decided and they would seek the opportunity at some point to seek the overruling of it? Judge ALITO. That was the express position of President Reagan himself. He had spoken on the issue and he had written on the issue. Senator SESSIONS. So your opinion to the Solicitor General as a young staff attorney in the Solicitor General’s office was, in some ways, contrary to that of the President of the United States?

Judge ALITO. Well, I was doing what I thought my job was as an advocate, which was to outline the litigation strategy that would be in the best interests of my client, given what my client was interested in, and it seemed to me that the strategy that I recommended was the best strategy to be followed.
Senator SESSIONS. And did they follow your suggestions? Judge ALITO. No, they did not. They argued that Roe v. Wade should be overruled and the Supreme Court rejected that— Senator SESSIONS. They, in fact, carried out a frontal assault and it was not approved by the Court. So I think that, to me, plus your other decision in which you ruled that Health and Human Services funds could be utilized to fund an abortion for those who qualified was a closed question, that case was, I thought. There was a dissent in it, but you ruled in favor of the pro-choice, the pro-abortion side of that case even though a dissent argued that it was in error, is that correct? Judge ALITO. That is correct. That’s what I thought the law required. I thought we were required to defer to the Department of Health and Human Services’s interpretation of the statute and so that’s how I voted. And if I’d been out to implement some sort of agenda to strike down—to uphold any abortion regulation that came along, then I would not have voted the way I did in that Elizabeth Blackwell case. Senator SESSIONS. Back in your memorandum in 1985 on the question of abortion, one of the provisions of the Pennsylvania law that was struck down by the court of appeals simply said that there must be a humane and sanitary disposal of aborted fetuses, and you thought that was unwise and you pointed out that there’s a Federal statute already on the books that mandates the humane disposal of excess wild free-roaming horses and burros, did you not? Judge ALITO. Yes, that’s correct. That was the statute. Senator SESSIONS. So this idea that every time a court rules on a pro-abortion opinion, that they’re always correct, I think is not true. I think the court has been awfully arrogant and dismissive of the States’ rights and legitimate concerns in some of these questions that we’re dealing with. Judge Alito, you know the salary that a Federal judge makes, is that right? Judge ALITO. I do, all too well. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. You know what it would be on the Supreme Court? Judge ALITO. I actually don’t know exactly, no. Senator SESSIONS. It’s a little more, I think, not much. Do you think you can live on that? Judge ALITO. I can. I’ve lived on a Federal judge’s salary up to this point. Senator SESSIONS. You’ve been accused of favoring an all-powerful Executive a couple of times in this Committee. Can the President cut your pay? Judge ALITO. No, he can’t do that. That’s in—the Constitution says that, fortunately. Well, nobody can. The President certainly can’t and Congress can’t, either.

[Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. Have a sigh of relief there. They can increase it, though, right? Judge ALITO. They can, yes. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. Well, we have a tight budget. Senators and Congressmen feel, sometimes privately they will tell you they think they need to be paid more, but we are paid pretty generously, in my view, and maybe we need to set some examples about financial management. Maybe we would like to do more, but it is difficult. But I raise that point because a Supreme Court can declare null and void a legislative enactment by the Congress, can it not, if it violates the Constitution— Judge ALITO. Yes. Yes, it can. Senator SESSIONS [continuing]. In their opinion? Judge ALITO. Yes. Senator SESSIONS. Does anybody review the Supreme Court’s review? Judge ALITO. No. No. Senator SESSIONS. And Congress can cut off money for any program they want to. In fact, the Anti-Deficiency Act says it is a crime for any agency of government to spend money that has not been appropriated by Congress. Is that a reviewable Act by anyone, for Congress not to fund a program or agency of the U.S. Government? Judge ALITO. No, I don’t think that’s reviewable. Senator SESSIONS. And aren’t there things that the Executive branch can do that are not reviewable? Judge ALITO. There are certainly some things that are not reviewable. Vetoes are not reviewable. Pardons are not reviewable. Senator SESSIONS. So the mere allegation that an act of the President is unreviewable may not be as disastrous as it sounds or as bad as it sounds, because certain branches are given certain powers. Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator SESSIONS. I would like to talk a little bit about this question of activism, and I want to be frank about it. Some of our liberal colleagues have correctly made the point that conservatives can be activists, too. And if you take the definition of activism as an action by a judge who allows their personal, political, or social or moral values to override their commitment to the law, do you believe that a judge who is conservative can be an activist just as easily as one who is liberal? Judge ALITO. Yes, I do. I don’t think that activism has anything to do with being a liberal or being a conservative. It has to do with not following the proper judicial role. It has to do with a judge’s substituting his or her own views for what the Constitution means and for what the laws mean. Senator SESSIONS. Now, if a statute passed by Congress plainly violates the Constitution, is it an activist decision if the Court strikes it down, in your opinion? Judge ALITO. No, I think that’s been settled since Marbury v. Madison back at the beginning of the 19th century, that when a case is presented to the Supreme Court and there is a question

raised about the constitutionality of a statute and the Court concludes that the statute is unconstitutional, it’s the obligation of the Court to follow the Constitution and not the statute.
Senator SESSIONS. Well, if you take the definition of activism I think that Senator Hatch and others have used that indicates, as we just discussed, that it is departing from the faithful application of the law, I think you can have liberal and conservative activists. But I would just say to you the mere striking down of a statute that is unconstitutional is not activism, not if you are faithful to the Constitution and to the laws of the land.
And I would say this: I believe on our side of the aisle, the deep concern that we have about judicial activism is a legitimate one. We believe that there has been a liberal social agenda being promoted too often by the courts that is foreign to our history and contrary to the wishes of the American people. I believe your philosophy is not one to enforce a conservative activism. I believe your philosophy is simply to follow the law and let the political branches debate these issues and decide them through the proper political process.
Is that fair to say? Judge ALITO. That’s exactly correct. The judiciary should do what it is supposed to do, but it has to have respect for the political process. And our constitutional system sets up a Government under which most of the decisions, the policy decisions, the things that affect people in their daily lives—the spending of money, taxing, decisions about foreign policy, and many other areas—are to be made by the political branches of the Government, and the judiciary’s role is confined to enforcing the Constitution and enforcing the laws and not going beyond that. Senator SESSIONS. As you analyze how to interpret the Constitution of the United States or a statute passed by the U.S. Congress, do you believe that authoritative insight can be obtained by reading the opinions of the European Union? Judge ALITO. I don’t. I don’t think that it’s very helpful—in fact, I don’t think it is helpful to look at the decisions of foreign courts for the interpretation of our Constitution. I think we can do very well with our own Constitution and our own judicial precedents and our own traditions. And I don’t say that with disrespect to the other countries. But I don’t think that there are insights to be provided on issues of American constitutional law by examining the decisions of foreign courts. I think that it’s very interesting from a political science perspective to see what they’ve done, and I’ve personally been interested in this over the years. And I think it’s flattering to us that so many other countries have followed our judicial traditions. But on issues of interpretation of our Constitution, I don’t think that that’s useful. Senator SESSIONS. Judge Alito, this is a big deal in our country today. Millions of Americans believe that the Court is losing discipline, that it is not remaining faithful to the Constitution. And, in fact, I share many of those views. A lot of people do. Do you think that if a court, in fact, is not faithful to the law but allows personal or political or social views to influence their decisions, that this could in the long run endanger public respect for

law and even undermine the great heritage of the rule of law that we have in this country?
Judge ALITO. I think that everybody who holds a public office under the Constitution has a solemn responsibility to follow the Constitution and the laws that define the role that that person, that officer is supposed to play. And I think that the continued success of our constitutional system and public respect for the constitutional system are dependent on people who have the public trust doing that, making a really strong effort to follow the provisions of the Constitution and other laws that define the role that they are supposed to play.
Senator SESSIONS. I would like to just once more touch on this Groody case in which there was a search of a young girl. A warrant was issued, was it not, by a Federal magistrate? Was it a Federal magistrate?
Judge ALITO. It was a State magistrate. Senator SESSIONS. A State magistrate. And the police officers go to the State magistrate, and they get a warrant, and the magistrate says that the affidavit is made a part of the search warrant. And the officers take it, and in their search warrant, they made affidavit that the individuals in this house known for distributing drugs often had drugs on their persons. And they then went and executed the warrant after going to the court and getting approval. And they find people on the premises, and there were two females, and a female officer took the two females into an upstairs bedroom and did a quick search by asking them to pull down their outer garments—not all their garments—pull up their blouse, and determined they had no contraband or weapons on them. And that was that. And the case came before you, years later, I suppose, on a lawsuit against the police officers. And that is what you were ruling on, were you not? Judge ALITO. That’s right, whether they were liable for money damages. And under the law, if they had a reasonable belief that they were authorized by the warrant to search people who were found on the premises, then they should not be liable for civil damages. The warrant had been—the warrant had incorporated the affidavit for purposes of establishing probable cause, and the officers had said in the affidavit that there is probable cause to believe that people on the premises may have drugs on their possession, and the magistrate judge had accepted that by incorporating the affidavit for purposes of probable cause. And under those circumstances, I thought that at a minimum it was reasonable for the officers to believe that the judicial officer, the magistrate, had said that they were to do exactly what they did. Senator SESSIONS. I agree. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Thank you, Judge Alito. At this point we will take a break until 5 minutes to 5. [Recess 4:39 p.m. to 4:55 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We now turn to Senator Feingold for 30 minutes. Senator FEINGOLD. Judge, thank you for all your patience today and throughout this process.

Judge ALITO. Thank you, Senator. Senator FEINGOLD. There has already been a lot of discussion of this topic today, but I would like to be sure I understand your opinion about whether the President, as Commander in Chief, can ignore or disobey an express prohibition that Congress has passed. The Torture Statute is one example, but, obviously, I could imagine a variety of others as well, as I am sure you could. So here is the question: what are the limits, if any, on the President’s power to do what he thinks is necessary to protect national security regardless of what laws Congress passes? Judge ALITO. Well, when you say regardless of what laws Congress passes, I think that puts us in that third category that Justice Jackson outlined, the twilight zone, where according to Justice Jackson, the President has whatever constitutional powers he has under—he possesses under Article II, minus what is taken away by whatever Congress has done, by an implicit expression of opposition or the enactment of a statute. And to go beyond that point, I think we need to know the specifics of the case. We need to know the constitutional power that the President—the type of Executive power the President is asserting and the situation in which it’s being asserted, and exactly what Congress has done. Senator FEINGOLD. Then let us take a more concrete example. Does the President, in your opinion, have the authority, acting as Commander in Chief, to authorize warrantless searches of Americans’ homes and wiretaps of their conversations in violation of the criminal and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance statutes of this country? Judge ALITO. That’s the issue that’s been framed by the developments that have been in the news over the past few weeks, and as I understand the situation, it can involve statutory questions, the interpretation of FISA, and the provision of FISA that says that no wiretapping may be done except as authorized by FISA or otherwise authorized by law, and the meaning of the authorization for the use of military force, and then constitutional questions. And those would be—those are issues, as I said this morning, that may well result in litigation. They could come before me on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. They certainly could come before the Supreme Court. And before—those are weighty issues involving two of the most important considerations that can arise in constitutional law, the protection of a country and the protection of people’s fundamental rights, and I would have to know the specifics and the arguments that were made. Senator FEINGOLD. They are indeed important questions, and that is why it is so important for me to try to figure out where you would be heading on this kind of an issue, and in fact, the question I just asked you was not something I formulated right now. It is the question that I asked word for word of the Attorney General of the United States at his confirmation hearing in January 2005. He answered as follows: ‘‘Senator, the August 30th memo—that’s the memo that we sometimes refer to as the torture memo—has been withdrawn. It has been rejected, including that section regarding the Commander in Chief authority to ignore the criminal statutes. So it’s been rejected by the Executive branch. I categorically reject it. And in addition to that, as I’ve said repeatedly today,
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00424 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

413
this administration does not engage in torture and will not condone torture. And so what you’re really discussing is a hypothetical situation,’’ was the end of his quotation.
Well, we now know, of course, that it was not a hypothetical situation at all, and when the Attorney General said he categorically rejected the torture memo, including the section regarding the Commander in Chief’s authority to ignore criminal statutes, he was also not being straight with this Committee. So I would like you to try to answer this question. Can the President violate or direct or authorize others to violate the criminal laws of the United States?
Judge ALITO. The President has the obligation, under Article II of the Constitution, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. And the laws mean, first and foremost, the Constitution of the United States. That applies to everybody. It applies to the President. And the President, no less than anybody else, has to abide by the Constitution. And it also means that the President must take care that the statutes of the United States that are consistent with the Constitution are complied with, and the President has an obligation to follow those statutes as well.
Those are the important general principles, and the application of them in a particular case depends on the facts of the case and the arguments, and a judge needs to know the arguments that are being made on both sides before reaching a conclusion about the result. Those are the overriding considerations.
Senator FEINGOLD. I take that answer—and, obviously, you may not be able to comment on it because of the possibility of it coming before you—I take that to be a pretty serious answer in terms of the President’s responsibilities to uphold and make sure that the laws are followed, including the criminal laws of the United States. So given the fact that this interpretation of the FISA law may well come before you at some point, I take it, as you have indicated, that would not only be an initial part of your analysis, but an awfully important analysis of whether the President has the power to override these criminal statutes. I certainly want to say for the record I do not believe the President has the ability to do that in this case, and in fact, I think, it would be almost impossible to interpret the FISA law in any other way than it clearly states, that it is the exclusive authority with regard to wiretapping outside of the criminal law.
You said earlier today, Judge, in response to Senator Leahy, that these types of gravely important constitutional questions very often do not end up being resolved by the judiciary, but rather by the other two branches. So what is the proper role of the judiciary in resolving a dispute over the President’s power to disobey an express statutory prohibition?
Judge ALITO. Well, the judiciary has the responsibility to decide cases and controversies that are presented to the judiciary, and that means that there has to be a concrete dispute between parties, and the parties have to have standing under the Constitution, and there’s a whole doctrine that’s called the Political Question Doctrine, but it’s a very misleading term for people who are not lawyers. It doesn’t mean that a dispute has something to do with politics or anything like that, it means that the dispute—in the sense
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00425 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.001 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

414
in which people usually use the term ‘‘politics’’—it means that it’s a kind of dispute that the Supreme Court has outlined as being not a proper dispute to be resolved by the judiciary, involving a constitutional issue that should be resolved often between the branches of Government.
And I was talking earlier about some things that the President does that are not reviewable, vetoes, pardons, et cetera. There are things that Congress does that are not reviewable, impeachment, et cetera. In Baker v. Carr, Justice Brennan’s opinion outlined a whole list of factors that inform the analysis of whether something is a justiciable dispute, and sometimes these disputes between the branches of Government are held by the Supreme Court to fall into that category of being disputes that can’t properly be resolved by the courts.
Senator FEINGOLD. Do you expect that this matter of the warrantless searches is likely to be resolved with regard to the initial political question doctrine, or do you think it would be likely to be resolved on the merits with regard to the statute and the Constitution?
Judge ALITO. I don’t think I could answer that without providing sort of an advisory opinion about something that could well come up. If this does come up in litigation, then the courts have an obligation to decide whether it’s a justiciable dispute.
The Political Question Doctrine, this doctrine of issues that are not justiciable, often involves conflicts between the branches of the Government, and when a person is asserting the person’s individual rights are violated, that is the type of case that is often resolved, I mean typically resolved by the judiciary.
Senator FEINGOLD. Judge, are we not going to be in kind of a tough spot if we find out the Supreme Court cannot help us figure out whether the FISA law is an exclusive authority or not? Is that not going to be hard to resolve between the Executive and the Congress?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, when I was—when I referred—when I said in reference to Senator Leahy’s question that often disputes between the two branches are resolved without resorting to the courts, I don’t think I was referring specifically to this issue, and if I gave that impression, that was a false impression.
I think I was—what I meant to say, and what I hope that I did say, was that separation powers disputes in general sometimes fall within this doctrine.
Senator FEINGOLD. You noted a few times today that the questions of the President’s power in the wiretapping area and other areas will likely come before the courts, including the Supreme Court. You just did that. As I understand it, you have prepared for these hearings over the past few months with a variety of practice sessions. Some have called them moot courts or murder boards. Was the question of the President’s power in time of war to take action contrary to a Federal statute ever raised in any way during any of the practice sessions for these hearings?
Judge ALITO. I have had practice sessions on a great variety of subjects, and I don’t know whether that specific issue was brought up. It may have been. But what I can tell you—

Senator FEINGOLD. You do not recall whether this issue or the question of—
Judge ALITO. Well, exactly—no, the issue of FISA certainly has been something that I have studied, and FISA is not something that has come before me as a judge.
Senator FEINGOLD. But you do not recall whether or not this was covered in the practice session?
Judge ALITO. No, no. The specific question that you raised about the conflict between the President’s authority to say that a statute enacted by Congress should not be followed, but the general area of wiretapping and foreign intelligence surveillance wiretapping—
Senator FEINGOLD. And in fact, the recent events that have led to this dispute—
Judge ALITO. And the recent— Senator FEINGOLD [continuing]. And the possibility— Judge ALITO. And the recent events. Senator FEINGOLD [continuing]. That it may come before you, right, Judge? Judge ALITO. That’s correct, but— Senator FEINGOLD. OK. Who was present at these practice sessions where these questions were discussed, and who gave you feedback or suggestions or made any comment whatsoever on the answers you gave? Judge ALITO. Nobody at these sessions or at any of the sessions that I had has ever told me what to say in response to any question, and— Senator FEINGOLD. I just asked—were there no comments or— Judge ALITO. The comments that I’ve received— Senator FEINGOLD. No advice? Chairman SPECTER. Let him answer the question, Senator Feingold. Judge ALITO. The advice that I’ve received has gone generally to familiarizing me with the format of this hearing, which is very different from the format of legal proceedings in which I have participated either as a judge or previously when I was arguing a legal issue as a lawyer. But nobody has told me what to say. Everything that I have said is an expression of my own ideas. Senator FEINGOLD. And I do not question that. Judge, I asked you though whether anybody gave you any feedback or suggestions or made any comment whatsoever on the answers you gave in the practice session? Judge ALITO. In general, yes, they’ve given me feedback, mostly about the form of the question—the form of the answers. Senator FEINGOLD. Have you received any other advice or suggestions, directly or indirectly, from anyone in the administration on how you should answer these questions? Judge ALITO. Not as to the substance of the question, no, Senator. Senator FEINGOLD. Only as to the style? Judge ALITO. That’s correct, as to the format, not as to the—not as to what I should say I think about any of these questions, absolutely not. I’ve been a judge for 15 years, and I’ve made up my own mind during all that time, and—

Senator FEINGOLD. And again, I am not suggesting that. I am asking whether or not—
Judge ALITO. No, I just want to make that clear. Senator FEINGOLD [continuing]. Somebody talked about the possible legal bases that the President might assert with regard to the ability to do this wiretapping outside of the FISA statute. Was that kind of a discussion held? Judge ALITO. Nobody actually told me the bases that the President was asserting. I found the letter that was released last week or the week before by an Assistant Attorney General, setting out arguments relating to this, on the Internet myself, and printed it out, and I studied it to get some idea of some of the issues that might be involved here. And I looked at some other materials that legal scholars have put out on this issue, but nobody in the administration actually has briefed me on what the administration’s position is with respect to this issue. Senator FEINGOLD. Does it strike you as being inappropriate for members of the Department of Justice or the White House staff, who are currently defending the President’s actions and the NSA domestic spying program, to be giving you advice on how you might handle questions about that topic in the hearing? Judge ALITO. It would be very inappropriate for them to tell me what I should say, and I wouldn’t have been receptive to that sort of advice, and I did not receive that kind of advice. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Judge. I want to come back to Mitchell v. Forsythe, in which you participated in the Solicitor General’s Office. As we have already heard, that case considered the Government’s argument that President Nixon’s Attorney General, John Mitchell, should be granted absolute immunity for authorizing warrantless wiretaps, and you signed the Government’s brief, making that argument. The Supreme Court rejected the claim of absolute immunity, noting that the Attorney General, acting in the inherently secretive national security context, has few built-in restraints. Justice White, writing for the Court in Mitchell, said, ‘‘The danger that high Federal officials will disregard constitutional rights in their zeal to protect national security is sufficiently real to counsel against affording such officials an absolute immunity.’’ Now, that statement still has a lot of relevance today, does it not? Judge ALITO. Yes, it does. Absolute immunity is quite restricted under our legal system, but there are some high-ranking officials in all three branches of the Government, who do have absolute immunity just from civil damages, not from criminal liability or from impeachment, or removal from office, but for—or for injunctive relief, they can be ordered to comply with the Constitution, but as far as civil damages are concerned. Senator FEINGOLD. But when you were at the Solicitor General’s Office you wrote this memo about the case, saying, ‘‘I do not question the Attorney General should have this immunity for authorizing warrantless wiretap.’’ Why did you not question the Attorney General’s absolute immunity? Judge ALITO. First of all, because it was the position that our client, whom we represented in an individual capacity, and it was his money that was at stake here, wanted to make. So we had an obli-

gation that was somewhat akin to the obligation of a private attorney representing a client.
Second, it was an argument to which the Department was committed. It has been made in Kissinger v. Halperin in the Carter administration. It was repeated in Harlow v. Fitzgerald in the Reagan administration. In Harlow v. Fitzgerald, the Supreme Court, while rejecting the idea that cabinet officers in general should have absolute immunity from civil damages, had said something like, and I’m not going to be able to provide an exact quote, but something like, but the situation could well be different for people who are involved in sensitive national security matters or foreign matters.
Senator FEINGOLD. But you said in your memo that, quote, ‘‘I do not question the Attorney General’s absolute immunity.’’ You did not say it is, quote, ‘‘it is the position of our office,’’ or as you were just saying, this administration has argued this in the past. You, in effect, injected yourself into the statement. Clearly, you were expressing your personal opinion on this legal issue, were you not?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I actually don’t think I was expressing a personal opinion. I was saying that in my capacity as the writer of this memo who was recommending that the argument not be made, even though it was one that our client wanted to have made, I wasn’t disputing the general argument to which the Department was committed. But I thought that we should take a different approach, that we should just argue the issue of appealability. But that was not the approach that was taken.
Senator FEINGOLD. Let us go on to the Solicitor General’s brief in the Mitchell case, which you signed. That brief argues strongly for the need for absolute immunity, arguing that it is far more important to give the Attorney General as much latitude as possible in the national security context than to, as the brief puts it, quote, ‘‘defer the occasional malevolent official,’’ from violating the law. Now, I find this statement particularly troubling today in light of the current administration’s warrantless wiretapping in the name of national security. Do you agree with that statement in the brief, that broad deference is warranted even if some Attorneys General may abuse their power?
Judge ALITO. I think the issue of the scope of the immunity that the Attorney General has is now settled by Mitchell v. Forsythe. That is the law. It was considered—the argument was considered by the Supreme Court and they decided the question.
Judges have absolute immunity for their judicial decisions. Members of Congress and their staff have absolute immunity for things that they do that are integral to the legislative process. The President has absolute immunity from civil damages for the President’s official acts. But absolute immunity is used very sparingly because of just the considerations that you’re referring to. But the consideration on the other side is that people who are involved in lots of things that make other people angry—judges deciding cases, Members of Congress passing legislation, Presidents doing all sorts of things—would otherwise be subjected to the threat of so many political reprisals that they would be driven from office. It’s a policy judgment that our law has made that some people should have absolute immunity, but it’s used very sparingly.

Senator FEINGOLD. I find your comments interesting because, of course, the argument is often fairly made that after 9/11, we have to recognize the important role that our Executive plays in protecting the American people. But I would also argue that it is a particularly compelling time to make sure there isn’t undue deference, given the types of powers that the Executive may seek to use in trying to fight this threat.
In your class notes from a seminar you gave at Pepperdine Law School on ‘‘Civil Liberties in Times of Emergency,’’ you repeatedly raised the question of whether the judiciary has the capability to review certain types of determinations made by the Executive branch in national security cases in particularly factual issues, and we have recently seen an example of a court evidently expressing its frustration at a national security case when the facts presented to it by the Executive, which it had accepted, apparently did not hold up. Of course, I am talking about the Fourth Circuit’s serious concern it hadn’t been told that Jose Padilla needed to be held militarily as an enemy combatant because he had plotted to use a dirty bomb in the United States, and then finding out that three-and-ahalf years later, the Justice Department wanted to transfer him to law enforcement authorities to stand trial for entirely different and much less serious crimes. In Padilla, the Fourth Circuit was originally willing to defer to the Executive’s assertion that it needed to hold Padilla militarily. It was quite upset, and justifiably, I think, to find out that it might not have deserved such deference.
I am not going to ask you about that case because I know that case is coming before the Supreme Court, but I do want you to say something about the role of the judiciary in evaluating the facts presented to it in national security cases by the Executive branch. How does a court decide whether to rely on the facts presented to it by the Executive in a national security case?
Judge ALITO. What I was doing in that talk at Pepperdine was framing that question, and it’s a lot easier to frame the question and to ask students to think about it and give me their reactions than it is to answer it. We’ve had examples of instances in which the judiciary in the past has had to confront this issue of reviewing factual presentations of the Executive in times of national crisis and there have been instances in which the judiciary has accepted—and I’m thinking of the Japanese internment cases, has accepted, which were one of the great constitutional tragedies that our country has experienced—has accepted factual presentations by the political—by the Executive branch that turned out not to be true, and from my reading of what went on, were not believed to be true by some high-ranking Executive officials at the time.
But there is the problem of judicial fact finding, which I was talking about earlier, and the context of things that may be taking place on the battlefield, for example, or things that are taking place in wartime probably are more difficult for the judiciary to evaluate than other factual questions. So that’s the dilemma and I can’t say that I can provide a clear answer to it.
Senator FEINGOLD. I do appreciate your referencing the Korematsu case and the problem there and how this is going to become an even more serious issue.

I want to switch to something else, the matter of the Vanguard case and the recusal. This has been characterized today as a nonissue. One Senator said it is a joke, it is ridiculous. Another one said it is an absurd, just plain absurd. And another, the same Senator said it was a blatant tactic to torpedo your nomination.
Well, Judge, I was the Senator that asked Judge Roberts very searching questions about whether or not he should have recused himself in the Hamdi case. I am sure he didn’t enjoy it. I didn’t particularly enjoy asking the questions, but in the end, I voted for him.
So let me just say to my colleagues, I reject this idea that when we come here to do our job of examining a nominee, that asking questions about an ethical issue is somehow a political game or an attempt to torpedo a nomination. You know, this idea of insulating yourselves and insulating the nominee before we even ask questions about a subject really is not conducive to the kind of process that this Chairman and this Ranking Member have made possible on the first nomination and this one, as well. So I think this is our job and I ask you these questions in this spirit. I might add, although my time is limited, that when you hear the actual facts of it, whatever conclusions we draw, it is certainly not a trivial matter. It is something that I think we ought to cover.
So let me begin by following up on Senator Kennedy’s question regarding the promise you made to the Committee. In 1990, in your Senate questionnaire at the time of your nomination to the Third Circuit, you were asked how you would handle potential conflicts of interest. You told the Committee that you did not believe conflicts of interest relating to your financial interests were likely to arise. Nevertheless, you wrote, quote, ‘‘I would, however, disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard Companies, the brokerage firm Smith Barney, or the First Federal Savings and Loan of Rochester, New York.’’ You also wrote that you would disqualify yourself from any case involving your sister’s law firm and from any case in which you participated or that was under your supervision in the United States Attorney’s Office. Now, whether or not such recusals were required under the Federal recusal law, your statement to the Committee was clear, unambiguous, and not time limited. Now, I think for that reason alone, it is more than legitimate to ask some questions in front of this Committee about this.
This morning, Senator Hatch read from a letter from the ABA, apparently received yesterday, although we did not see it until today. That letter talked about what you told the ABA when you asked about Vanguard and the other ethics issues. You also answered a number of questions from Senator Hatch about the case.
But your responses to both the ABA, as far as we can tell from the letter, and Senator Hatch did not say anything at all about your promise to this Committee. Instead, you responded by saying that you didn’t notice the recusal issue because you did not get socalled clearance sheets in this case because it was a pro se case and that you didn’t, quote, ‘‘focus’’ on the issue of recusal. You also didn’t mention something that the clerk of your court told us in a letter, that all judges have standing recusal lists that all cases— all cases—both pro se cases and cases where the parties are rep-

resented by counsel are checked against before they are sent to judges.
So my first question is this. After you were sworn in as judge, did you notify the court of your commitments to the Senate and request that the Vanguard Companies, Smith Barney, and First Federal Savings and Loan be included on your standing list of parties whose involvement in a case would require your recusal?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I don’t have a copy of the initial computer list, so I can’t answer that question. At some point, Vanguard—the computer lists that are available from, I think, 1992 and 1993 do not have Vanguard on it and I don’t know why that is so—
Senator FEINGOLD. So you don’t recall whether you notified them or not?
Judge ALITO. I do not know. Senator FEINGOLD. Judge, we know you notified the court in 1990 that the U.S. Attorney’s Office and your sister’s law firm should be on your standing recusal list because you recused yourself from a number of such cases in the first several years you were on the bench. And we also finally received additional documents just yesterday from the court. These documents show that the Vanguard Companies and the other financial entities you listed in 1990 were not on your standing recusal list, which you approved in 1993, 1994, 1995, or 1996. Do you remember removing them from your standing recusal list, or is it fair to assume—or is it your belief that they were never put on your recusal list? Judge ALITO. Senator, I don’t know. I don’t know whether I— whether they were removed. I don’t think I ever told the clerk’s office, take them off. It may be that at some point, I submitted a new list and they were not on the list. I do think it’s important to keep in mind that this list is just an aid for the judge. This is not a comprehensive list of everything that will cause a judge to recuse himself. Senator FEINGOLD. I understand. I just want to get the facts down. So to be clear on the facts, there is no evidence that you requested that Vanguard appear on your standing recusal list before 2003 when you informed the clerk that Vanguard and apparently also Smith Barney should be added, and you don’t have any independent recollection of adding them to the list before then, either— Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator FEINGOLD [continuing]. Isn’t it? Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator FEINGOLD. Now, you explained to the ABA that the problem in these cases was that the conflict screen system was not working in these cases and you told Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch this morning that there were some oversights in this case, and you wrote in a November 10 letter to Senator Specter, due to an oversight, it did not occur to you that Vanguard’s status might call for your recusal. But it seems that the problem was not that the screening program was not working or that there was a computer glitch, as you and the White House originally suggested, but either that Vanguard was not on your recusal list and you didn’t remember your promise, or that you did not recognize that Vanguard was a party in the case. Isn’t that a fair characterization?

Judge ALITO. Well, there was an oversight and the oversight was on my part in not focusing on the issue of recusal when I first received the case.
Senator FEINGOLD. So there wasn’t—so the problem really—you can admit now, can’t you, that this was not a computer glitch or a failure of the screening system. You are really saying something very different at this point.
Judge ALITO. I am not saying something different as to the screening system. The screening system was exactly what I described this morning, and I described that to the ABA, involving—
Senator FEINGOLD. But you don’t think it was a computer glitch anymore, do you?
Judge ALITO. It was not a complete computer glitch, and if I could just explain, the origin of that was that when I was down here shortly after the President announced his intention to nominate me, I started to be—I started to receive questions about this Vanguard issue and I was receiving information from our clerk’s office, and that based on the information that I received, it was my impression that there had been a computer glitch and that was the origin of that statement and that information that constitutional—
Senator FEINGOLD. Let me ask you this in my last few seconds. When you wrote to Judge Scirica indicating that you would recuse yourself from the Monga v. Ottenburg case, why did you feel the need to argue that you weren’t, in fact, required to do so? Why not just admit you made a mistake, agree to recuse, and move on? Why didn’t you just do that when the issue was raised here instead of coming up with these different explanations that in some cases, I think, have become unconvincing?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, when the recusal motion came in, I was disturbed by it and I wanted to see what the Code of Conduct exactly required in this context. Twelve years had gone by and no Vanguard case had come up and I hadn’t had an occasion to look at this issue. And when I looked at it, it—the recusal motion was very harsh and it accused me of unethical conduct and I took it seriously and I wanted to see what the Code required, and I researched it and it was my conclusion that I was not required by the Code to recuse, but then I went on and said, but I still don’t want to participate in this case and I would like to have the initial decision vacated and make sure that Ms. Maharaj had an entirely new appeal, and that’s what I asked for and that’s what was done.
Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Judge. Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. On this particular issue, could I take just 2 minutes out of my next round? Chairman SPECTER. If you want to comment, you may, and Senator Feingold can have an opportunity to respond. Senator HATCH. Sure. On your form that you filled out, the question was, explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest, including the procedure you will follow in determining these areas of concern. Identify the categories of litigation and financial arrangements that are likely to present potential conflicts of interest during your initial service in the position to which you have been nominated. Now, this case arose 12 years later, didn’t it?

422
Judge ALITO. Yes, it did, Senator. Senator HATCH. That is hardly your initial service. To be held to that type of a standard, especially in a case that every ethics professor I know of says you didn’t do anything wrong in, seems to me is going a little bit beyond the pale here and it is overblown. Frankly, I think you have got to read the whole thing. You are a good lawyer and you have agreed to do it, but it was during your initial service. Now, I guess you could interpret initial service to be a year or two or 3 years, but 12 years? I don’t think so. Senator FEINGOLD. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Senator Feingold, do you care to— Senator FEINGOLD. Yes. I mean, the fact is the nominee continues to have the holdings in Vanguard. They have appreciated in value. The time hasn’t changed that. I think the Judge here was at least trying to suggest there might have been some mistake made here and instead we are getting sort of after-the-fact justifications that put some kind of a time limit on the promise he made to this Committee, and there was no time limit on the promise that was made to the Committee. Senator HATCH. I still have 30 seconds left. Judge, No. 1, you have researched it and you didn’t have to recuse yourself. You concluded that? Judge ALITO. Yes, I did. Senator HATCH. No. 2, these ethics professors have concluded that, right? Judge ALITO. That is right. Senator HATCH. No. 3, you have tried to comport with the highest standards of ethics during your whole 15 years on the bench, right? Judge ALITO. I have tried to do that and to go beyond what— Senator HATCH. No. 4, I believe we will have judges from that court who will say that you have. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Feingold? Senator FEINGOLD. Mr. Chairman, I am curious if this isn’t a situation where he felt the need to recuse himself why he wouldn’t have put Vanguard on the list as something he should recuse himself from— Senator HATCH. Because he was mistaken, that is why. Chairman SPECTER. We are going to move on now. I think that this slight exchange is permissible as an exception to our general rules. It livens up the afternoon. [Laughter.] Senator HATCH. I want my 2 minutes back. Chairman SPECTER. Anything at about 5:30 in the afternoon is welcome. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Graham? Senator GRAHAM. That was an interesting exchange. I guess there is no rule against beating a dead horse or we would all have quit a long time ago, so— [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM [continuing]. So in the next 30 minutes, I am going to ask you the same questions you have been asked for a whole day, and I hope you will understand if any of us come before

a court and we can’t remember Abramoff, you will tend to believe us.
[Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. Now I know why they give you a lifetime appointment for doing this. I was skeptical before, but I think once is enough in a lifetime. For what it is worth, I think you have done a great job. You have been very forthcoming. You have seldom used—I may have to decide that you have answered a lot of questions and I particularly enjoyed Senator Feingold’s questions about Executive power and I will pick up on that. No. 1, from a personal point of view, do you believe the attacks on 9/11 against our Nation were a crime or an act of war? Judge ALITO. That is a hard question to answer and— Senator GRAHAM. Good. Judge ALITO. That is a way of buying 30 seconds while I think about the answer. Senator, I think that what I think personally about this is really not something that would be—that would inform anything that I would have to do as a judge. Senator GRAHAM. Well, Judge, I guess I disagree because I think we are at war and the law of armed conflict in a wartime environment is different than dealing with domestic criminal enterprises. Do you agree with that? Judge ALITO. It certainly is. Senator GRAHAM. We have laws on the books that protect us, the Fourth Amendment included, from our own law enforcement agencies coming against our own citizens. But we also have laws on the books during a time of war to protect or country from being infiltrated by foreign powers and bodies who wish to do harm to us. That is a totally different legal concept. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. I am reluctant to get into this because I think that things like act of war can well have particular legal meanings in particular contexts and, you know, under the Constitution. Senator GRAHAM. Do you doubt that our Nation has been in an armed conflict with terrorist organizations since 9/11, that we have been in an undeclared state of war? Judge ALITO. In a lay sense, certainly we have been in a conflict with terrorist organizations. I am just concerned that in the law all these phrases can have particular meanings that are defined by the cases. Senator GRAHAM. That is very important, and let’s have a continuing legal education seminar here about the law of armed conflict in the Hamdi case. The Hamdi case is precedent. Is that correct? It is a decision of the Supreme Court. Judge ALITO. It certainly is, yes. Senator GRAHAM. And it tells us at least two to three things. No. 1, it tells us something that I find reassuring that the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, survive even in a time of war. Judge ALITO. That is certainly true. Senator GRAHAM. So there is a holding in that case that I want to associate myself with, and I think Senator Feingold does, that even during a time of war when your values are threatened by an enemy who does not adhere to those values, they will not be threat-

ened by your Government unless there is a good reason. Do you agree with that?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I agree that the Constitution was meant to deal with all of the contingencies that our country was going to face. And I think the Framers hoped that we would not get involved in many wars, but they were students of history and I am sure they realized that there would be wars. They provided for war powers for the President and for Congress, and the structure is meant to apply both in peace and in war.
Senator GRAHAM. And you said in your previous testimony that no political figure in this country is above the law, even in a time of war.
Judge ALITO. That is correct. Senator GRAHAM. There is another aspect of the Hamdi case that no one has picked up upon, but I will read to you. ‘‘In light of these principles, it is of no moment that the authorization to use military force does not use specific language of detention, because detention to prevent a combatant’s return to the battle field is a fundamental incident of waging war. In permitting the use of necessary and appropriate force, Congress has clearly and unmistakably authorized detention in the narrow circumstances considered here, and those circumstances were a person alleged by the Executive branch to be an enemy combatant.’’ And one of the principles we found from the Hamdi case is that because we are, in my opinion, at war and Congress has authorized the President to use force against our enemies, the Executive branch, according to the Hamdi case, inherent to his power of being Commander in Chief, can detain people who have been caught on the battle field. Does that make sense to you? Do you agree that is the principle of the Hamdi case? Judge ALITO. That is the principle of the Hamdi case. Senator GRAHAM. And it makes perfect sense because if we catch someone in Afghanistan or Iraq or any other place in the world who is committing acts of violence against our troops or our forces, or we catch people here in the United States who have infiltrated our country for the purpose of sabotaging our Nation, there is no requirement in the law to catch and release these people, is there? Judge ALITO. Well, Hamdi speaks to the situation of an individual who was caught on the battlefield. Senator GRAHAM. In the history of our Nation, when we captured German and Japanese prisoners, was there ever a legal requirement anybody advanced that after a specific period of time you have to let them go? Judge ALITO. It is my understanding that the prisoners of war who were taken in World War II were held until the conflict was over. Senator GRAHAM. It would be an absurd conclusion for a court or anyone else to tell the executive branch that if you caught somebody legitimately engaged in hostile activities against the United States that you have to let them go and go back and fight us again. That makes no sense, does it? Judge ALITO. Well, I explained what my understanding is about how this matter of holding prisoners was handled in prior wars.

This issue was addressed in Hamdi, in what was discussed in Hamdi in the context of—
Senator GRAHAM. In the Padilla case, they held an American citizen who was engaged in hostile activities against the United States allegedly as an enemy combatant and the Fourth Circuit said the President, during a time of hostility, has the ability to do that.
Do you agree that that is a part of our jurisprudence? Judge ALITO. That was the holding in Padilla. Senator GRAHAM. Yes. Judge ALITO. Yes, that was the holding of the lower court in— of Padilla, yes. Senator GRAHAM. Now, the point I am trying to make is that when you are engaged in hostilities, there are some things that we assume the President will do. If we don’t kill the enemy, we capture the enemy. The President, as the Commander in Chief, will make sure they don’t go back to the battle. No. 2, if we catch someone and there is a question to their status, whether or not you are prisoner of war under the Geneva Conventions, are you an enemy combatant, who traditionally in our constitutional democracy determines whether or not—the status of a person engaged in hostilities? Judge ALITO. Well, Padilla—I am sorry—Hamdi said that a person who is being detained, an unlawful person who is asserted to be an unlawful combatant and who is being detained, has the right—has due process rights. And the issue of the type of tribunal—and they explained to some degree how that would be handled, but the identity of the particular tribunal that would be required to adjudicate that was not an issue that was decided in Hamdi or any of the other cases. Senator GRAHAM. Can you show me an example in American jurisprudence where the question of status, whether a person was a lawful combatant or an unlawful combatant, was decided by a court and not the military? Judge ALITO. I can’t think of an example. I can’t say that I am able to survey the whole history of this issue, but I can’t think of one. Senator GRAHAM. Can you show me a case in American jurisprudence where an enemy prisoner held by our military was allowed to bring a lawsuit against our own military regarding their detention? Judge ALITO. I am not aware of such a case. Senator GRAHAM. Is there a constitutional right for a foreign non-citizen enemy prisoner to have access to our courts to sue regarding their condition of confinement under our Constitution? Judge ALITO. Well, I am not aware of a precedent that addresses the issue. Senator GRAHAM. Do you know of any case where an enemy prisoner of war brought a habeas petition in World War II objecting to their confinement to our Federal judiciary? Judge ALITO. There may have been a lower court case. I am trying to remember the exact status of the individual and it was— Senator GRAHAM. Well, let me help you. There were two cases. One of them involved six saboteurs, the In Re Quirin—

426
Judge ALITO. Quirin case, yes. Senator GRAHAM. Would you agree with me that that case stood for the proposition that in a time of war or declared hostilities, an illegal combatant, even though they may be an American citizen— the proper forum for them to be tried in is a military tribunal and they are not entitled to a jury trial as an American citizen in a non-wartime environment? Judge ALITO. Well, those were a number of German saboteurs who landed by submarine in the United States and they were taken into custody and they were tried before a military tribunal and the case went up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court sustained their being tried before a military tribunal. At least one of them claimed to be an American citizen, and most of them—I think all but one or two actually were executed. Senator GRAHAM. And our Supreme Court said that is the proper forum during a wartime environment to try people who are engaged in illegal combat activities against our country. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. Well, they sustained what was done under the circumstances that I described. Senator GRAHAM. Well, that would be a precedent, then, wouldn’t it? Judge ALITO. It is the precedent, yes. Senator GRAHAM. OK. There was a case involving six German soldiers captured in Japan and transferred to Germany, and they brought a habeas petition to be released in the Eisen—I can’t remember the— Judge ALITO. Eisentrager. Senator GRAHAM. Well, you know it. Tell me what the court decided there. Judge ALITO. Well, they were—as I recall, they were Germans who were found in China assisting the Japanese— Senator GRAHAM. China and not Japan. You are right. Judge ALITO [continuing]. Assisting the Japanese after the termination of the war with Germany, and they were unsuccessful in their habeas petition. And that was interpreted prior to the Supreme Court’s decisions a couple of years ago to mean that there was a lack of habeas jurisdiction over them because they were being held in territory that was not U.S. territory. Senator GRAHAM. For those who are watching who are not lawyers, generally speaking in all of the wars that we have been involved in, we don’t let the people trying to kill us sue us, right? And we’re not going to let them go at an arbitrary time period if we think they are still dangerous because we don’t want to go have to shoot at them again or let them shoot at us again. Is that a good summary of the law of armed conflict? Judge ALITO. The precedent—I don’t know whether I would put it quite that broadly, Senator. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. The precedent that you—Johnson v. Eisentrager, of course, has been substantially modified, if not overruled. Ex Parte Quirin, of course, is still a precedent. There was a lower court precedent involving someone who fought with the Italian Army and I can’t remember the exact name of it, and that was the case that

I thought you were referring to when you first framed the question. But those are the precedents in the area.
Then if you go back to the Civil War, there is Ex Parte Milligan and a few others. Now, in Hamdi—
Senator GRAHAM. We don’t have to go back that far. Judge ALITO. Well, in this area, I think it is actually instructive to do it. But in Hamdi, the Court addressed this question of how long the detention should take place and they said—because they were responding to the argument that this situation is not like the wars of the past which had a more or less fixed—it was not anticipated that they would go on for a generation and they said we will get to that if it develops that way. Senator GRAHAM. Who is better able to determine if an enemy combatant, properly held, has ongoing intelligence value to our country? Is it the military or a judge? Judge ALITO. On intelligence matters, I would think that is an area where the judiciary doesn’t have expertise. But we do get into this issue I was discussing with Senator Feingold about the degree to which—the balance between the judiciary’s performing its function in cases involving individual rights and its desire not to intrude into areas where it lacks expertise particularly in times of war and national crisis. Senator GRAHAM. So having said that, if we have a decision to make as a country when to let someone go who is an enemy combatant, I guess we have got two choices: we can have court cases, or we can allow the military to make a determination if that person still presents a threat to the United States, and whether or not that person has an intelligence value by further confinement. Do you feel the courts possess the capabilities and the competence to make those two decisions better than the military? Judge ALITO. The courts do not have expertise in foreign affairs or in military affairs, and they certainly should recognize that. And that is one powerful consideration in addressing legal issues that may come up in this context. But there is the other powerful consideration that it is the responsibility of the courts to protect individual rights in cases that are properly before the Court, cases where they have jurisdiction in one way or another, cases that are fit for judicial resolution. Senator GRAHAM. I totally understand that, but our courts have not by tradition gotten involved in running military jails during time of war. I can’t think of one time where a prisoner of war housed in the United States during World War II, a German Nazi or a Japanese prisoner was able to go and sue our own troops about their confinement. I think there is a reason there is none of those cases. It would lead to chaos. Now, when it comes to treating detainees and how to treat them, I think the Congress has a big, big role to play, and I think that the courts have a big role to play. Are you familiar with the Geneva Convention? Judge ALITO. I have some familiarity with it. Senator GRAHAM. Do you believe it has been good for our country to be a signatory to that convention? Judge ALITO. I think it has, but it’s not really my area of authority. That’s Congress’s area of authority.

428
Senator GRAHAM. Well, just as an American citizen, are you proud of the fact that your country has signed up to the Geneva Convention and that we have laid out a system of how we treat people who fall into our hands and how we will engage in war?
Judge ALITO. I think the Geneva Convention—and I’m not an expert on the Geneva Conventions, but I think they express some very deep values of the American people, and we have been a signatory of them for some time, and I think that—
Senator GRAHAM. Now, let’s go back to the legal application of the Geneva Convention. If someone was captured by an American force and detained, either at home or abroad, would the Geneva Convention give that detainee a private cause of action against the U.S. Government?
Judge ALITO. Well, that’s an issue, I believe, in the Hamdan case, which is an actual case that’s before the Supreme Court. It goes to the question of whether a treaty is self-executing or not. Some treaties are self-executing.
Senator GRAHAM. Has there ever been an occasion in all the wars we have fought where the Geneva Convention was involved whether the courts treated the Geneva Convention as a private cause of action to bring a lawsuit against our own troops?
Judge ALITO. I’m not familiar with such a case, but I can’t say whether there might be some case or not.
Senator GRAHAM. Now, when it comes to what authority the Executive has during a time of war, we know the Supreme Court has said it is implicit from the force resolution that you can detain people captured on the battlefield. Hamdi stands for that proposition. Is that correct?
Judge ALITO. That’s what was involved in Hamdi. Senator GRAHAM. The problem that Senator Feingold has and I have and some of the rest of us have is does that force resolution— does it have the legal effect of creating the exception to the FISA court? And I know that may come before you, but let’s talk about generally how the law works. You say that the President has to follow every statute on the books unless the statute allows an exception for the President. Is that a fair statement? Just being President, you cannot set aside the law. Judge ALITO. The President has to follow the law, and that means the Constitution and the laws that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. Senator GRAHAM. There is a statute that we have on the books against torture. Are you familiar with that statute? Judge ALITO. The Convention Against Torture, well, the statutes implementing the Convention Against Torture. Senator GRAHAM. And the statute provides the death penalty for somebody who violates the conventions as a possible punishment. Judge ALITO. That’s right. If death results, the death penalty is available. Senator GRAHAM. So this idea that Senator McCain somehow banned torture is not quite right. The Convention on Torture and the statute that we have implementing that convention were on the books long before this year. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. Yes, they were.

429
Senator GRAHAM. Do you believe that any President, because we are at war, could say, ‘‘The statute on torture gets in the way of my ability to defend the United States, therefore, I don’t have to comply with it’’?
Judge ALITO. The President has to comply with the Constitution and the laws of the United States that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. That is the principle. The President is not above the Constitution and the laws.
Now, there are issues about the interpretation of the laws and the interpretation of the Constitution, but—
Senator GRAHAM. Are you a strict constructionist? Judge ALITO. I think it depends on what you mean by that phrase, and if you— Senator GRAHAM. Well, let’s forget that. We will never get to the end of that. [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. Have you heard the term used? Judge ALITO. I have heard the term used. Senator GRAHAM. Is it fair to say that when it is used by politicians, people like me, we are trying to tell the public we want a judge who looks at things very narrowly, that does not make a bunch of stuff up? Is that a fair understanding of what a strict constructionist may be in the political world? Judge ALITO. Well, if a strict constructionist is a judge who doesn’t make things up, then I’m a strict constructionist. Senator GRAHAM. There you go. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I agree with that, Senator. Senator GRAHAM. Now, if there is a force resolution that Congress passes to allow any President to engage in military activity against someone trying to do us harm, and the force resolution says the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, or just make it generic, if someone argued that that declaration by Congress was a blanket exemption to the warrant requirement under FISA, would that be a product of strict constructionist legal reasoning? Judge ALITO. I think that a strict constructionist, as you understand it, would engage in a certain process in evaluating that question, and a strict constructionist, a person who interprets the law— and that’s how I would put it. A person who interprets the law would look at the language of the authorization for the use of military force and legislative history that was informative, maybe past practices—were there prior enactments that are analogous to that? What was the understanding of those? And a host of other considerations that might go into the interpretive process. Senator GRAHAM. I guess what I am saying, Judge, is I can understand when the Court ruled that the President has it within his authority to detain people on the battlefield under this force resolution, that makes sense. I understand why the President believes he has the ability to surveil the enemy at a time of war. And the idea that our President or this administration took the law in their own hands and ignored precedent of other Presidents or case law and

just tried to make a power grab I don’t agree with. But this is really not about you, so you don’t have to listen. I am talking to other people right now.
[Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. The point I am trying to make is what Justice Jackson made, that when it comes to issues like this, when we surveil our enemy and we cross our own borders and we have information about our own people, we need, in my opinion, Judge, to have the President at the strongest. And that would be when Congress through collaboration with the President comes up with a method of dealing with that situation, and that it could be very dangerous in the long run if we overinterpret war resolutions, because I have got a problem with that. And I believe that if we don’t watch it and we overinterpret these resolutions, we will have a chilling effect for the next President. The next President who wants to use force to protect us in a justifiable manner may be less likely to get that resolution approved if we go too far. And, Judge, you are likely to rule on these issues, and my hope is before you rule that we all sit down between the Executive and the legislative and we talk about this. Because as you said before, our Nation, not only our legal system, is strongest when we work together. Executive power, the Constitution allows the President to nominate judges. If Congress tried to change that by statute and say that we would like to pick the judges, what would happen, hypothetically? Judge ALITO. I have a certain self-interest in the answer to that question. Senator GRAHAM. I thought you might. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I think that— Senator GRAHAM. Clearly—clearly—the statute would fall to the Constitution. A veto is not reviewable by courts because that is basically a political decision. Under the Constitution, what is the vote requirement to get confirmed to the Supreme Court? Judge ALITO. It is a majority. Senator GRAHAM. Hypothetically speaking, what if the Senate passed a statute or had a rule that said you cannot get a vote to be on the Supreme Court unless you get 60 votes? How does that sit with you? Judge ALITO. Speaking in my personal capacity or in my judicial capacity? [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. Your judicial capacity. Judge ALITO. Senator, I just don’t think I should answer questions like—constitutional questions like that. I need to know— Senator GRAHAM. What if the Senate said during an impeachment that we don’t want a two-thirds vote of the Senate, we want a majority vote, would the Senate’s action fall to the Constitution? Judge ALITO. Well, when—there are certain questions that seem perfectly clear, and I guess there is no harm in answering— Senator GRAHAM. Is there any doubt in your mind the Constitution requires a majority vote to be on the Supreme Court or any other Federal judicial office?

Judge ALITO. You know what? I remember this phrase from law school—
Senator GRAHAM. Is that a super duper precedent? Judge ALITO. I think it’s what we call in law school ‘‘the slippery slope,’’ and if you start answering the easy questions, you’re going to be sliding down the ski run and into the hard questions, and that’s what— Senator GRAHAM. Well, then— Judge ALITO.—I’m not too happy to do. Senator GRAHAM. That is what I tried to get you to do, and I am glad you didn’t do it. The bottom line to this exercise is you have got a job, I have got a job, and what disturbs me a bit is that we are beginning to hold the lawyer responsible for the client. And in my remaining time here, what damage could be done to the legal profession or the judiciary if people in my profession start holding your client’s position against the advocate? Judge ALITO. Well, I think it has been traditionally recognized that lawyers have an obligation to their clients. That’s how our legal system works. Some lawyers have private clients. Some lawyers work for Government agencies, and the lawyer-client relationship there is not exactly the same. But, still, there is a lawyer-client relationship. And I think our whole system is based on the idea that justice is best served— Senator GRAHAM. If you were an Attorney General representing a State that passed a ban on partial-birth abortion, would it be fair to that Attorney General if they came before this Committee to hold that against them if you disagreed with them on the subject matter? Judge ALITO. I think that Attorneys General—I can speak to the issue of the Attorney General of the United States because I know there’s a statute and there’s an understanding about what the Attorney General of the United States will do when an Act of Congress is called into question, and the obligation of the Attorney General is to defend the constitutionality of the Act of Congress unless no reasonable— Senator GRAHAM. A lawyer’s obligation is to defend their client’s interest. Is that an accurate statement of what a lawyer is supposed to do? Judge ALITO. It certainly is, yes. Senator GRAHAM. No matter whether that client is popular or not or the position is popular or not. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. Consistent with ethical obligations and professional responsibility, yes, indeed. Senator GRAHAM. What has this process been like for you and your family? And in a short period of time, could you tell us how to improve it? Judge ALITO. Well, it’s been a combination of—at times it’s been a thrill and at times it’s been extremely disorienting. I spent the last 15 years as a judge on the court of appeals, and you probably could not think of a more cloistered existence than a judge on the court of appeals. Most of the time nobody other than the parties pays attention to what we do. When an article is written in the paper about one of our decisions, it’s ‘‘a Federal appeals court in

Philadelphia’’ or in whatever city. And this has been a strange process for me. I made some reference to that yesterday, but I understand the reason for it. And I am reluctant in my current capacity as a nominee to offer any suggestions about the process. I think that’s—you’re carrying out your responsibility. I spoke about the fact that different people under the Constitution have different obligations, and you have the advice and consent function, Congress, the Senate does. And I think it’s for the Senate to decide what it should do in this area.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Graham. Senator Schumer? Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Senator Specter. And I want to thank you, Judge Alito. It has been a long day. Judge Alito, in 1985 you wrote that the Constitution—these are your words—does not protect a right to an abortion. And you said to Senator Specter a long time ago, I think it was about 9:30 this morning, 9:45, that those words accurately reflected your view at the time. Now let me ask you, do they accurately reflect your view today? Do you stand by that statement? Do you disavow it? Do you embrace it? It is OK if you distance yourself from it and it is fine if you embrace it. We just want to know your view. Judge ALITO. Senator, it was an accurate statement of my views at the time. That was in 1985, and I made it from my vantage point as an attorney in the Solicitor General’s Office, but it was an expression of what I thought at that time. If the issue were to come before me as a judge, if I am confirmed and if this issue were to come up, the first question that would have to be addressed is the question of stare decisis, which I have discussed earlier, and it’s a very important doctrine and that was the starting point and the ending point of the joint opinion in Casey. And then if I were to get beyond that, if a court were to get beyond the issue of stare decisis, then I would have to go through the whole judicial decisionmaking process before reaching a conclusion. Senator SCHUMER. But sir, I am not asking you about stare decisis. I am not asking you about cases. I am asking you about this, the United States Constitution. As far as I know, it is the same as it was in 1985 with the exception of the 27th Amendment, which has nothing to do with what we are talking about. Regardless of case law, in 1985, you stated—you stated it proudly, unequivocally, without exception—that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion. Do you believe that now? Judge ALITO. Senator— Senator SCHUMER. I am not asking about case law. I am not asking about stare decisis. I am asking your view about this document and whether what you stated in 1985 you believe today, you have changed your view, you have distanced your view. You can give me a direct answer. It doesn’t matter right now which way you answer, but I think it is important that you answer that question. Judge ALITO. The answer to the question is that I would address that issue in accordance with the judicial process as I understand it and as I have practiced it. That is the only way I can answer that question.

433
Senator SCHUMER. Sir, I am not asking for the process. Obviously, you would use a judicial mindframe. You have been a judge for 15 years. I am asking you, you stated what you believed the Constitution contained. You didn’t say the Constitution as interpreted by this or that. You didn’t say the Constitution with this exception or that exception. It was a statement you made directly. You made it proudly. You said you are particularly proud of that personal belief that you had. Do you still believe it?
Judge ALITO. And Senator, I would make up my mind on that question if I got to it, if I got past the issue of stare decisis, after going through the whole process that I have described. I would need to know the case that was before me and I would have to consider the arguments, and they might be different arguments from the arguments that were available in 1985—
Senator SCHUMER. But sir, I am not asking you about case law. Now, maybe you read a case and it changed your view of the Constitution. I am asking you, and not about the process you would use. I am asking you about your view of the Constitution, because as we all know, and we are going to talk about stare decisis in a few minutes, that if somebody believes, a judge, especially a Supreme Court Justice, that something is unconstitutional, even though stare decisis is on the books, governs the way you are and there is precedent on the books for decades, it is still important to know your view of what the Constitution contains.
And let me just say, a few hours ago, in the same memo, I can’t remember who asked the question, but you said you backed off one of the statements you had written. You said it was inapt, which taught me something. I didn’t know that there was a word that was inapt, but you said that it was inapt to have written that the elected branches are supreme. So you discussed that, your view on that issue, without reference to case law because there was no reference to case law when you wrote it. There was no reference to case law when you wrote this.
Can you tell us your view, just one more time, your view about the Constitution not protecting the right to an abortion, which you have talked about before and you said you personally proudly held that view. Can you?
Judge ALITO. The question about the supremacy—the statement about the supremacy of the elected branches of government went to my understanding of the constitutional structure of our country, and so certainly that’s a subject that it is proper for me to talk about. But the only way—you are asking me how I would decide an issue—
Senator SCHUMER. No, I am not. I am asking you what you believe is in the Constitution.
Judge ALITO. You are asking me my view of a question that— Senator SCHUMER. I am not asking about a question. I am asking about the Constitution, in all due respect, and something you wrote about before— Judge ALITO. The Constitution contains the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment. It provides protection for liberty. It provides substantive protection. And the Supreme Court has told us what the standard is for determining whether something falls within the scope of the protection—

434
Senator SCHUMER. Does the Constitution protect the right to free speech?
Judge ALITO. Certainly, it does. That is in the First Amendment. Senator SCHUMER. So why can’t you answer the question of does the Constitution protect the right to an abortion the same way, without talking about stare decisis, without talking about cases, et cetera? Judge ALITO. Because answering the question of whether the Constitution provides a right to free speech is simply responding to whether there is language in the First Amendment that says that the freedom of speech and freedom of the press can’t be abridged. Asking about the issue of abortion has to do with the interpretation of certain provisions of the Constitution. Senator SCHUMER. Well, OK. I know you are not going to answer the question. I didn’t expect really that you would, although I think it would be important that you would. I think it is part of your obligation to us that you do, particularly that you stated it once before. So any idea that you are approaching this totally fresh without any inclination or bias goes by the wayside. But I do have to tell you, Judge, your refusal, I find troubling. It is sort of as if I asked a friend of mine 20 years ago, if a friend of mine 20 years ago said to me, he said, ‘‘You know, I really can’t stand my mother-in-law,’’ and a few weeks ago I saw him and I said, ‘‘Do you still hate your mother-in-law?’’ He said, ‘‘Well, I’m now married to her daughter for 21 years, not 1 year.’’ I said, ‘‘No, no, no. Do you still hate your mother-in-law?’’ And he said, ‘‘Mmm, I can’t really comment.’’ What do you think I would think? Judge ALITO. Senator, I think— Senator SCHUMER. Let me just move on. You have a very nice mother-in-law. I see her right here and she seems like a very nice person. [Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. OK. Judge ALITO. I have not changed my opinion of my mother-inlaw. That’s a question— Senator SCHUMER. I am glad you haven’t. She seems nice. Judge ALITO.—I can answer that question. Senator SCHUMER. Let me go now to stare decisis, because what you have said is you start out with stare decisis, although I think a lot of people would argue you start out with the Constitution upon which stare decisis is built. OK. Now, you have tried to reassure us that stare decisis means a great deal to you. You point out that prior Supreme Court precedents like Roe will stand because of the principle. While you are on the Third Circuit, of course, you can’t overrule precedents of the Supreme Court, but when you are on the Supreme Court, you have a little bit more flexibility. I just want to ask you this. Stare decisis is not an immutable principle, right? You have said that before in reference to Senator Feinstein. When Chief Justice Roberts was here, he said it was discretionary. So it is not immutable, is that right? You have told us it is not an inexorable command. It doesn’t require you to follow the precedent. Judge ALITO. It is a strong principle— Senator SCHUMER. Correct.

435
Judge ALITO [continuing]. And in general, courts follow precedents. They need a special—the Supreme Court needs a special justification for overruling a prior case.
Senator SCHUMER. But they have found them, and I think you went over this. I can’t recall if it was Senator Kohl or Senator Feinstein, but you went through some cases. In recent years, the Court has overruled various cases in a rather short amount of time. You mentioned, I think it was, National League of Cities about fair labor standards and it was overruled just 9 years later by Garcia. Stanford v. Kentucky was overruled by Roper v. Simmons. Bowers v. Hardwick was overruled by Lawrence v. Texas. And, of course, Brown v. Board was overruled by Plessy. So the bottom line, I mean, we can go through this—
Senator HATCH. Plessy was overruled by Brown. Senator SCHUMER. I mean, Plessy was overruled by Brown. I apologize. So the only point I am making is that despite stare decisis, it doesn’t mean a Supreme Court Justice who strongly believes in stare decisis won’t ever overrule a case, is that correct? You can give me a yes or no on that. It is pretty easy. Judge ALITO. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. Of course. OK. So now let us try this another way. Here is a quote: ‘‘Stare decisis provides continuity to our system. It provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decisionmaking, I think it is a very important and critical concept.’’ The statement sounds reasonable to me. It sounds to me like it is something you said to Senator Specter and others, right? Judge ALITO. I agree with the statement. Senator SCHUMER. Yes. Let me show you who said that statement. It was Justice Thomas. Justice Thomas came before us and stated that, and yet when he got on the Supreme Court, he voted to overrule, or expressed a desire to overrule, a whole lot of cases, including some very important ones on the Court. Here are some quotes. ‘‘Casey must be overruled.’’ ‘‘Buckley v. Valeo should be overruled.’’ ‘‘Bacchus,’’ just last year, ‘‘should be overruled.’’ And as you can see, it is a very large number of cases, and these aren’t all of them. In fact, Justice Thomas said that a 1789 unanimous case by the Supreme Court, Calder v. Bull, which no one talked about for centuries, should be overruled. So what do you think of Justice Thomas’s theory of stare decisis and how he applies it? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I have explained my understanding of the doctrine of stare decisis and it is important to me. I think it is an important part of our legal system. It is— Senator SCHUMER. How about what Justice Thomas—what do you think of what he is doing? Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t think I should comment on all of those cases. Senator SCHUMER. OK. Let me just say this. You may not want to comment, but his fellow Justice, Justice Scalia, did. Here is what Justice Scalia said about Justice Thomas and stare decisis, and remember what he said when he was sitting in the same chair you are sitting in. He pledged fealty to stare decisis. Justice Scalia said, Justice Thomas, quote, ‘‘doesn’t believe in stare decisis, period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong,

436
he would say, let us get it right.’’ Then Justice Scalia said, ‘‘I wouldn’t,’’ speaking of himself, ‘‘I wouldn’t do that.’’ And it is particularly relevant, because if you believe something is not in the Constitution, at least the way Justice Thomas talks about stare decisis, he would let the Constitution overrule it and stare decisis would go by the wayside, and I am not saying Justice Thomas was disingenuous with the Committee when he was here. I am just saying that stare decisis is something of an elastic concept that different judges apply in different ways.
So let me go to another one here. I think I have covered everything I want to do with Justice Thomas. Here is another quote. ‘‘There is a need for stability and continuity in the law. There is a need for predictability in legal doctrine and it is important that the law not be considered as shifting every time the personnel of the Supreme Court changes.’’ That again sounds reasonable to me, quite a lot like what you said. You don’t have any dispute with that statement, do you?
Judge ALITO. No, I don’t. Senator SCHUMER. OK. Well, let us see who said that one. It was Robert Bork when he came before this Committee to be nominated. Now, here is what Judge Bork wrote in the National Review Online just a few weeks ago. He wrote, quote, ‘‘Overturning Roe v. Wade should be the sine qua non of a respectable jurisprudence. Many Justices have made the point that what controls is the Constitution itself, not what the Court has said about it in the past.’’ And even before his hearing, by the way, he sort of cut back on what he said at the hearing, I guess. It may have been in a different context, but here is a quote that he said a year, I think, before he came before us. He said, ‘‘I don’t think that in the field of constitutional law precedent is all that important.’’ He said, in effect, that a Justice’s view of the Constitution trumps stare decisis. That is not an unrespectable view. It is probably not the majority view of Justices, but it is there. So, for example, it was his view, similar to Justice Thomas, that the Constitution does not protect a right to—that if the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, as you wrote in 1985, but we are not talking about how you feel today, it would be overruled. It should be overruled despite stare decisis. And one of the things I am concerned about here is that what you wrote, and I think Senator Kohl went over it a little bit, is what you wrote about Judge Bork in 1988. And by the way, this was not when you were working for someone or applying for a job. As I understand it, you were the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, well ensconced, a very good U.S. Attorney, and it was with some New Jersey news outlet. I saw the cite, but I didn’t know what it was. You said that, about Justice Bork, ‘‘I think he was one of the most outstanding nominees of this century. He’s a man of unequaled ability,’’ and here’s the key point, ‘‘understanding of constitutional history, and then someone who has thought deeply throughout his entire life.’’ Now, first, one of the most outstanding of the 20th century with Oliver Wendell Holmes and Benjamin Cardozo, and people you have expressed admiration for, Frankfurter, and Brennan and Harlan, I find it disconcerting that you would say that he is a great

nominee of the 20th century in his understanding of constitutional law, and yet he so abjectly rejects stare decisis.
Judge ALITO. Well, I certainly was not aware of what he had said about stare decisis when I made those comments. I have explained those comments. They were made when I was an appointee of President Reagan, and Judge Bork was President Reagan’s—
Senator SCHUMER. Excuse me. You were not working in the White House. You were a U.S. Attorney prosecuting cases. There was no obligation for you to say what you said, right?
Judge ALITO. No, but I had been in the Department of Justice at the time of—
Senator SCHUMER. I know, but it was a voluntary interview with some New Jersey news outlet, is that correct?
Judge ALITO. And I was asked a question about Judge Bork, and I had been in the Department at the time of his nomination, and I was an appointee of President Reagan, and I was a supporter of the nomination.
Senator SCHUMER. Let’s go to the next line of questioning here, but again, the point being judges, Justices, overrule cases despite stare decisis, particularly when they think the Constitution dictates otherwise. And now I want to turn to your own record in the Third Circuit, something you mentioned yesterday and today. When you have been on the Third Circuit, of course, you had to follow Supreme Court precedent, and you professed a whole lot of times your desire to do that, and I am not disputing that here. But it is also true that when you were on the Third Circuit, a more apt analogy in terms of stare decisis would be about Third Circuit precedents, because if you should get on the Supreme Court, stare decisis will apply to Supreme Court decisions the way stare decisis to a Third Circuit Judge applies to Third Circuit decisions. That is pretty fair, right?
Judge ALITO. Yes, and I’ve tried to follow Third Circuit precedents while I’ve been—
Senator SCHUMER. Although you have dissented more than most of your fellow judges, but we will leave that aside. What I want to show here is how many times, when you were on the Third Circuit, your fellow judges on the Third Circuit—who I am sure have high respect for you. I know a lot of them are coming here in a few days, and I think that is nice, I do not have any problem with that.
[Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. Well, there has been some criticism about it, not by me. I just want to show you what they have said when it comes to their view of your respect for Third Circuit precedent, stare decisis, as relevant as we can find it to you. So I am going to read a few. There are a whole bunch. But in Dia v. Ashcroft—they are all on this chart I guess. There are too many so the print is not large enough for most people to see. I wish there were fewer. In Dia v. Ashcroft the majority of your court said that your opinion ‘‘guts the statutory standard and ignores our precedent.’’ In LePages, Inc. v. 3M your opinion was criticized as ‘‘being contrary to our precedent and that of the Supreme Court.’’ In RNS Services v. Secretary of Labor you again dissented, and the majority again argued that, ‘‘Your dissent overlooks our holding in the instant case and prior

438
cases.’’ In Riley v. Taylor, the en banc majority argued that your view ignored case after case relied by the majority, and ‘‘accords little weight to those authorities.’’ In Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., a panel criticized your opinion because, ‘‘It does not comport with our reading of the relevant case law.’’ In Bray v. Marriott Hotels, the majority noted that binding circuit precedent made your analysis improper in a discrimination case.
And the list goes on and on. I do not have to—but other cases that are mentioned here, United Artists v. Warrington, Beauty Time v. VU Skin Systems. Here is a final one, Rappa v. New Castle County, Judge Garth, the man I think you clerked for and is regarded as a mentor to you, wrote that your majority opinion was ‘‘unprecedented’’ in its ‘‘disregard of established principles of stare decisis.’’ ‘‘Nothing,’’ Judge Garth wrote, ‘‘in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court or in ours suggests that a three-judge panel of a court of appeals is free to substitute its own judgment for that of a four-justice plurality opinion, let alone that of the entire court.’’
So those are just some of the cases in which your own colleagues said you did not follow stare decisis. Now, there may have been good reason. I am not—you are much more expert on these cases than I am. There may have been good reason for you to do it, but I think it shows something, and that is, you, if we have to project as to what kind of a Supreme Court Justice you will be, are not going to be as reluctant as some to overturn precedent even by the rules of stare decisis. And so you wonder if you are as willing as you are to depart from precedent on the Third Circuit, what is going to happen if you should get on the Supreme Court? Your response because I mentioned a whole lot of cases here.
Judge ALITO. You did, Senator, and I think that you need to examine each of the cases to see whether what I did was justified. Let me just take one that struck me when you read from it, and that was the United Artists case. What I said there was that a Supreme Court decision that had come up, that had been handed down after the most recent Third Circuit decision relating to the issue, superseded what our court had said. So I was following an aspect of stare decisis there. I was following what we call horizontal—I’m sorry—vertical stare decisis following the Supreme Court, and I don’t think there’s any dispute that when the Supreme Court hands down a decision that’s in conflict with one of our earlier cases, we have to follow the Supreme Court.
Senator SCHUMER. Yes, but there is no question that in that situation, Judge Cowen said your opinion was, ‘‘wrong to revisit an issue that has already been decided and failed to give respect and deference to the circuit’s well-established jurisprudence employing the improper motive test in the substantive due process land use context. It is rather complicated, but he is sure saying you did not follow, in his view, you did not follow court precedent.
Judge ALITO. And, Senator, there was this body of Third Circuit precedent, and then—and it said that it’s proper for a Federal court to get involved in a zoning dispute, which is traditionally a local matter, if there is simply an improper motive, whatever that might be. And in the—after that the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Souter, emphasized that the test under substantive due process in an area like this, an area that the other judge in the ma-

jority and I thought was like this, is whether what was done shocks the conscience.
And so you have a Supreme Court decision intervening, and in that situation I thought it was our obligation—and I wrote the majority opinion there—to follow what the Supreme Court had said.
Senator SCHUMER. But my only point being here is one judge’s view of what stare decisis requires, and another judge’s view of what stare decisis requires, are not always the same. The concept has some degree of elasticity, and when, in reference to questions by people, you say, well, how do you feel about this case—and particularly Roe, which has been where we started off here—‘‘I believe in stare decisis,’’ it means that you are going to take precedent into account, but it certainly does not necessarily mean where you would come out.
Let me tell you where I conclude where you would come out, just sort of summarizing this argument. First, again, greatly disturbing I think to many Americans would be that you will not distance yourself from your 1985 view that the Constitution does not protect a right to a woman’s right to choose, that that view has not changed, that you have refused to say, unlike you did in another part of that 1985 memo, that you think it is wrong now, which would lead one to think that you probably believe in it.
Second, you have told us you respect precedent and stare decisis, but we have seen that the stated respect for stare decisis hardly determines whether a Supreme Court Justice will vote to uphold precedents, not because when they come here they are being disingenuous with us. I do not think that at all. But because the concept is somewhat elastic, because it does not guarantee that you will uphold precedent, and particularly does not guarantee it when the Constitution conflicts with stare decisis, with the precedents of the Court.
And finally, to top it off, we have seen that your Third Circuit record can hardly provide a great deal of comfort in this area either, that many of your fellow judges criticized you for ignoring, abandoning, or overruling precedent.
Taken together these pieces are very disturbing to me. Your blanket 1985 statement, not distanced from, that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion; the fact that respect for precedent and stability does not prevent overruling of a past decision; and your own record of reversing or ignoring precedent on the Third Circuit lead to one inevitable conclusion.
We can only conclude that if the question came before you, it is very likely that you would vote to overrule Roe v. Wade.
I yield back my time. Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, could I just respond to that— Senator SCHUMER. Please, the time is yours. Judge ALITO [continuing]. To that question. My Third Circuit record, in looking at abortion cases, provides the best indication of my belief that it is my obligation to follow the law in this area and in all other areas. If I had had an agenda to uphold any abortion regulation that came along, I would not have voted as I did in my Third Circuit cases. Now, I’ve testified here today about what I think about stare decisis. I do think it’s a very important legal doctrine, and I’ve ex-

plained the factors that figure into it. It would be the first question that I would consider if an issue like this came before me.
Senator SCHUMER. Let me just say though, you have ruled on certain cases. Many of them were on technicalities. And in all of them as a Third Circuit Judge, you were bound by Supreme Court precedent. You never, in the Third Circuit, were squarely presented with the question that I asked, which is a decisive question, which is whether the Constitution protects a woman’s right to choose. You were never asked in the court, you were never asked to overturn Roe v. Wade. And even if you were in the Third Circuit, you could not, because you were bound by the precedent of the Court. I do not think your Third Circuit rulings are dispositive on what you would do should you become a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge ALITO. If the matter were to come up before me on the Supreme Court, I would consider the issue of stare decisis, and if the case got beyond that, I would go through that entire judicial decisionmaking process that I described. That’s not a formality to me. That is the way in which I think a judge or a Justice has to address legal issues, and I think that is very important, and I don’t know a way to answer a question about how I would decide a constitutional question that might come up in the future, other than to say I would go through that whole process. I don’t agree with the idea that the Constitution always trumps stare decisis— Senator SCHUMER. Does not always, but sometimes— Chairman SPECTER. Let him finish his answer, Senator Schumer. Senator SCHUMER. I am sorry. Judge ALITO. I don’t agree with the theory that the Constitution always trumps stare decisis. There would be no need for the—there would be no room for the doctrine of stare decisis in constitutional law if that were the case. Senator SCHUMER. But, sir, it can trump stare decisis, does not always, but can. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. It certainly can, and I think that is a good thing because otherwise, Plessy v. Ferguson would still be on the books. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Schumer. Senator Cornyn? Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, are you familiar with the question that lawyers sometimes pose to demonstrate how unfair a question can be: ‘‘When did you stop beating your wife? ’’ Judge ALITO. I am familiar with that question. Senator CORNYN. And I suppose the reason why— [Laughter.] Senator CORNYN. Since someone was picking on your mother-inlaw, I thought we would inject your wife into this. But the point is this: it is an unfair question because it implies, regardless of what your response has been, that at one time you did, when, in fact, you have not.

And I just want to explore, to start with, Senator Schumer’s questions about what is written in this Constitution about abortion. Does the word abortion appear anywhere in the Constitution?
Judge ALITO. No. The word that appears in the Constitution is ‘‘liberty.’’
Senator CORNYN. And outside of, let’s say, the Fourth Amendment, perhaps, does a right to privacy appear, explicitly stated, in the Constitution?
Judge ALITO. There is no express reference to privacy in the Constitution, but it is protected by the Fourth Amendment and in certain circumstances by the First Amendment and in certain circumstances by the Fifth and the 14th Amendments.
Senator CORNYN. And the reason it is protected is because the Supreme Court has so interpreted the Constitution. Isn’t that correct, sir?
Judge ALITO. That is correct. It is a question of interpretation rather than simply looking at what is in the text of the document.
Senator CORNYN. So to ask you whether the right to free speech, which is explicitly protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution—to ask you whether that is in there and then just ask you in the same question, or at least same series of questions, whether the right to abortion on demand is in the Constitution, one is explicitly stated in the First Amendment; the other is the product of Court interpretation. Isn’t that accurate, sir?
Judge ALITO. Yes, that is my view of it. Senator CORNYN. And to be more specific, it is what the courts have called penumbral rights. In other words, Griswold, I believe it was, talked about this being the penumbra of the emanations from stated rights in the Constitution. Can you clarify that for us so we can get it right? Judge ALITO. Yes. Griswold talked about emanations and penumbras, and Griswold has later been understood by the Supreme Court as being based on the protection of liberty under the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment. Senator CORNYN. Well, I was particularly troubled by the exchange of questions and answers because the suggestion is that you have somehow been unresponsive. And as I said in my opening statement, I do think that there are those who have already decided to vote against your nomination and are looking for some reason to do so. And I think one of the reasons that they may claim is that you have been nonresponsive. But I thought it was telling that Senator Schumer said he didn’t expect you to answer that question. I would like to refer back to Senator Biden’s comments where he praised you at the close of his remarks. He said, ‘‘I appreciate you for being responsive.’’ I agree with him. I cannot remember a nominee being this forthcoming. I appreciate that you have answered nearly every question put to you. Thank you for being so responsive. And indeed, according to one count, you have answered more than 250 questions thus far today. So I think in all fairness, the question is not a fair one to ask you whether the right to an abortion is written in this document. The fact is, and the reason why you apply the doctrine of stare de-

cisis is because you recognize the precedential effect, the authoritative effect of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of this document as the law of the land, do you not, sir?
Judge ALITO. That is correct. Senator CORNYN. And you mentioned Plessy v. Ferguson. I think it was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat Senator from Senator Schumer’s State, who said if it weren’t for the ability of the courts to go back and revisit these decisions, how would you ever correct a mistake? And I think the fact is that you have mentioned one of the instances where, thank goodness, the Court has gone back and revisited a terrible decision which has been a scar on our country and our jurisprudence, Plessy v. Ferguson. And if the Court, in Brown v. Board of Education, had felt prohibited from revisiting that mistake, then we would still be living under that scar and I think we can all agree that that would be a terrible thing. And thank goodness, we have a Supreme Court that has had the courage to go back, in accordance with the principles of stare decisis, and revisit terribly wrong decisions and to correct them and to bring us where we are today. You know, it must be strange to have people listen to the questions and answers here because on one hand, you will hear rather complimentary comments. On the other hand, even Senators who are still at least for the record undecided—I hate to think what it would be like if they had actually determined to vote against you already—making rather strong critical statements. But it means a lot to me to know that the people who know you best, the people who have worked with you on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, are very complimentary. I happen to believe that we ought to look to the people that know you best as being in the best position to judge your character, your integrity, your competence, and not this caricature that happens during these confirmation proceedings by the attack dogs, the interest groups who pay a lot of money, spend a lot of time trying to tear down that reputation for integrity and competence that you have worked so hard to build during your lifetime. But I was struck—and we will hear more about the judges who have served with you on the Third Circuit—but I was struck by a quote that I read from your former colleague, the late Judge Leon Higginbotham. Who is Judge Higginbotham, by the way, or who was he? Judge ALITO. Well, he was the former Chief Judge of the Third Circuit and he was a Federal judge for many years and greatly respected. Senator CORNYN. Well, this is what the Harvard Journal of African-American Public Policy—how it described him, in part. They said, ‘‘Higginbotham was appointed to the Federal circuit bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Higginbotham is also former president of the Philadelphia Chapter of the NAACP.’’ And would it be fair to say that you and Judge Higginbotham, while you served together, you tended to look at the Constitution differently? In other words, could he fairly be described as a liberal? Judge ALITO. I think probably most people would describe him that way. I thought we got along very well, and we generally

agreed. There were cases in which we disagreed and cases in which I dissented from an opinion that he wrote. And I think there were cases in which he dissented from opinions that I wrote.
Senator CORNYN. Well, I wonder if you are aware of one thing that he was quoted as having said. This is out of the Los Angeles Times, comments he made about you to Judge Timothy Lewis, quoted in the Los Angeles Times, ‘‘Sam Alito is my favorite judge to sit with on the court. He is a wonderful judge and a terrific human being. Sam Alito is my kind of conservative. He is intellectually honest, he doesn’t have an agenda, he is not an idealogue.’’
Were you aware that Judge Higginbotham had said that about you?
Judge ALITO. No, I wasn’t. I was not. Senator CORNYN. Well, I am pleased to tell you he did say it, according to the Los Angeles Times, and I think it is a high compliment that someone who would have perhaps such a divergent view and perhaps different political beliefs than you would say those sorts of things about you and your record on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Now, I have some charts, too, like Senator Schumer. I like my charts better than his, but we will let others be the judge. But I want to ask you a little bit about Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. You had some very high compliments about her yesterday. Senator Kyl, her fellow Arizonan, said some wonderful things about her, and I am confident that all of those accolades are well deserved. Some have called her the model Supreme Court Justice, and that is high praise, it really is. And I would like to submit for my colleagues’ consideration that if Sandra Day O’Connor was in the mainstream, then Sam Alito is, too, and this is why. For example, Justice O’Connor and Judge Sam Alito both set limits on Congress’s commerce power. Sandra Day O’Connor and Sam Alito both struck down affirmative action policies that had strict numerical quotas, and both—this ought to be a shocker to some based on what we have heard here today—both Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and Judge Sam Alito have criticized Roe v. Wade. In fact, this is pretty astonishing to me. According to the Harvard Law Review, over the last decade Justice O’Connor agreed more often with Chief Justice Rehnquist, 80 percent of the time, than with any other Justice. And let’s go through these individually. First of all we talk about whether it can be a Federal crime to possess a machine gun that doesn’t implicate trafficking or some aspect of interstate commerce. But, you know, all we have to do is go back to a little bit of the history we all learn in high school to remember the Articles of Confederation and the fact that the States were all-powerful. The national Government was crippled because it really had no power and was subject to the unanimous vote of the states before it could do things that were very important. And so then in Philadelphia, the delegates there wrote, and ultimately ratified, a Federal Constitution. But you already alluded to this earlier. This Constitution takes into account that not only will

444
the national Government have certain powers, but there will also be some powers still reserved to the States.
It is a fact, is it not, sir, that when we talk about federalism, really what we are talking about is the fact that our Federal Government, our national Government is one of enumerated powers that are set out in the Constitution and all powers that are not enumerated or necessary and proper to the execution of those enumerated powers as a general rule are reserved to the states?
Judge ALITO. Yes, that is the structure of the Constitution. The Federal Government has certain—has enumerated powers. Some of them are broad, but those are the powers the Federal Government has and the theory—and the structure is that everything else was reserved for the States.
Senator CORNYN. And so when someone suggests that you are taking a crabbed or cramped or unorthodox view toward congressional power because you say that it is not clear from the statute or the crime with which an individual is charged that interstate commerce is implicated, aren’t you enforcing that original understanding of what powers were expressly or otherwise delegated to the Federal Government and what powers were reserved to the States?
Judge ALITO. Well, that is what Lopez, as I understand it, tried to do. It said that although the commerce power is broad, it is not all-encompassing. It involves the regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, and this statute that we have in Lopez goes beyond that. And my case, the Rybar case, seems to me to be as close to the situation in Lopez as any case that I was aware of.
Senator CORNYN. Well, I know my constituents back in Texas, and I suspect people all across the country would be glad to know that you don’t believe that all wisdom and all power is centered in Washington, D.C., but that under our Federal system the State and Federal governments are partners, and that enforcing this structure that is a product of our history and a product of our Constitution is an important thing for judges to do.
But it is interesting because if Sandra Day O’Connor was in the mainstream on the interpretation of the Commerce Clause, then so is Judge Sam Alito. As a matter of fact, I believe in Rybar you said the question before the court is whether Lopez is a constitutional freak, or words to that effect, because as you pointed out, it was a little bit of a shock to everyone’s system to see the Supreme Court was actually serious about recognizing the authority of the States and that there are limits to congressional power. But Lopez reestablished or perhaps restated that understanding.
Judge O’Connor joined the majority in the Lopez decision, did she not, sir?
Judge ALITO. Yes, she did. Senator CORNYN. And so she shared at least to that extent your conviction that there is some limit to congressional power and that there was some point beyond which Congress’s authority could not reach unless it was made clear that it was pursuant to one of the powers enumerated under the Constitution. Did I say that roughly correctly? Judge ALITO. I agree with that she said that Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause is not all-encompassing. And my job

as a court of appeals judge is not to say that a decision of the Supreme Court should be limited to its facts; in other words, not applied as a precedent in any other comparable situation that comes along. My job is to take those precedents seriously and that is what I tried to do.
Senator CORNYN. So when Justice O’Connor held in Lopez that Congress could not prohibit the possession of handguns near schools because mere possession is not commerce, you were doing your very best to stick to that precedent established by the U.S. Supreme Court when you wrote your opinion in Rybar. Is that correct?
Judge ALITO. That’s correct. In Lopez, the Supreme Court said that possession of a firearm, mere possession is not a commercial activity, and the interstate commerce—the Commerce Clause authorizes the regulation of interstate commerce, and the activity involved in Rybar was the possession of a firearm. So it followed that if it was a noncommercial activity in Lopez, it must be a noncommercial activity in Rybar. That’s how I saw it.
Senator CORNYN. And you didn’t say the State couldn’t criminalize possession of a machine gun, did you?
Judge ALITO. No. The State could, and I think a great majority of States, if not—the great majority certainly have legislation of that nature.
Senator CORNYN. And you pointed out here that if the Congress had been a little more careful in showing the basis upon which mere possession could affect interstate commerce, that that would be a different case, and perhaps the outcome might have been different in Rybar.
Judge ALITO. Yes, that was a strong point that I made in the dissent, that if Congress had made findings, it would have been a very different case for me.
Senator CORNYN. You know, the interesting thing to me about Rybar as well, you have been accused of always ruling for the big guy or the government. But in Rybar you decided for the person accused of illegally possessing the machine gun.
Judge ALITO. Well, that’s correct. He was a criminal defendant. Senator CORNYN. You didn’t rule for the government? Judge ALITO. No, I did not. I thought the government had not come forward with evidence to support the position that they were arguing. Senator CORNYN. Well, there is another question about affirmative action cases. We have alluded a little bit to that. And Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the model Supreme Court Justice who is clearly in the mainstream, you and Justice O’Connor both agreed to strike down affirmative action policies which set numerical quotas which resulted in reverse discrimination. She did in Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education in 1986. You did in Taxman v. Board of Education in 1996. Would you agree with that, sir? Judge ALITO. I would. Taxman was a case that our court considered en banc, that is, all the judges were sitting, and I sit on a very moderate court that is certainly not unreceptive to the concept of affirmative action in general. But the vote in that case was 8–4. It wasn’t a close vote. And I joined the opinion that was written

by my late colleague, Judge Mansmann, holding that that particular affirmative action plan was in violation of Title VII.
Senator CORNYN. Let’s talk again about Roe v. Wade. Now, this is going to be a shocker for some people based upon what has gone on before, because it has been suggested that but for Sandra Day O’Connor, Roe v. Wade may be overruled; that this is really what lies in the balance here during your confirmation proceedings. But the fact is that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, the model Supreme Court Justice, wrote in The City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, ‘‘The trimester three-stage approach adopted by the Court in Roe cannot be supported as a legitimate or useful framework.’’ Roe, she said, ‘‘is clearly on a collision course with itself.’’
And in the memorandum for which you have been disparaged many a time when you were in the Solicitor General’s office, you recommended, ‘‘Don’t mount a frontal attack on Roe v. Wade but instead use the opportunity to nudge the Court toward the principles in Justice O’Connor’s Akron dissent.’’
So when you had an opportunity to urge the reversal of Roe v. Wade, even as a lawyer for the administration, you urged a more cautious approach and one consistent with Justice O’Connor’s opinion at the time. Isn’t that correct, sir?
Judge ALITO. Yes, Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Akron, which was the last previous big Supreme Court decision at that time, was one of the things that influenced me in the memo that I wrote in Thornburgh. She analyzed Roe, and I was quite persuaded by the points that she made in the Akron decision. And the general approach—the arguments that I was recommending that the Government make in the Thornburgh case were along the lines of the undue burden standard I think that was later—that she later adopted. I was arguing that the particular provisions should be challenged on their own terms. One of the provisions was an informed consent provision that was virtually identical to the informed consent provision that later came up in Casey, and in Casey it was upheld.
Senator CORNYN. Well, let’s talk about Casey. That was a 1992 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. Isn’t that correct, sir?
Judge ALITO. Yes. Senator CORNYN. And in Casey, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, and Justice O’Connor, the model Supreme Court Justice, essentially scuttled the principal argument in favor of the right to abortion based on this trimester approach, which Justice O’Connor criticized and which has also been criticized by people like Justice Ginsburg, former counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union, who now serves on the Court; Laurence Tribe, a well-known liberal legal scholar at Harvard. The fact is Roe v. Wade, the writing itself, the justification for the decision has been widely criticized by legal scholars all across the spectrum, has it not, sir? Judge ALITO. It certainly had been at the time of the 1985 memo, and although I wasn’t recommending that the Government get into that issue, I mentioned in the memo some of the authors who had criticized Roe’s reasoning. Senator CORNYN. Well, and in 1992, the only thing that really survived in Roe v. Wade, which was written 33 years ago, was the

essential holding—I guess you could call it that—and there have been some quotes about the importance of reliance interests in terms of observing—giving it the benefits of stare decisis or precedent. But essentially the whole legal scheme or basis upon which abortion was protected was changed to an undue burden standard. Isn’t that right, sir?
Judge ALITO. In Casey, the Supreme Court moved away from the trimester approach, and they adopted the undue burden standard, which had been set out in some earlier opinions by Justice O’Connor and the joint opinion in Casey made it clear that that was now the governing standard under Supreme Court law.
Senator CORNYN. But the plurality opinion—Justice O’Connor, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter—did not say you can have abortion without limitation. It did recognize the right of the States to pass laws which regulate abortion as long as it did not create an undue burden on a woman’s right to have an abortion, according to that decision. Isn’t that roughly what the plurality said?
Judge ALITO. Yes, that’s what they held. Senator CORNYN. Let’s get the other chart. My point is that if on at least three counts, on the basis of does Congress’s commerce power, limitations on congressional authority in the affirmative action area, and in terms of criticizing the basis upon which Roe v. Wade was decided 33 years ago, you and Justice O’Connor bear a lot of similarities. I would just ask that if Justice O’Connor is a model Supreme Court Justice and, therefore, by definition is not outside the mainstream, then it strikes me that Sam Alito is not outside the mainstream, either. Another thing you have been criticized for is your unlimited view of Presidential power, that is the way it has been phrased, the suggestion that somehow you are always going to defer to the President and the Executive branch when the legislative branch and the Executive branch vie for authority, whether it is in the intelligence gathering area, the National Security Agency and this electronic eavesdropping, which is really an early warning system to try to identify terrorists so we can protect ourselves against another 9/11, or other acts of Presidential power. Senator Graham talked a little bit about the Hamdi decision, where the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the use of force authorization that was issued by Congress after the 9/11 attack authorizing the President to use necessary force to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda, the supposed perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. The question came up in Hamdi whether that included an authorization by Congress to detain terrorists without charging them with a crime. My understanding is in that case that the Supreme Court, it was fractured, but the plurality opinion that Justice O’Connor wrote said that that authorization of use of force was a congressional Act which trumped the statutory limitation that Congress had previously passed about detaining American citizens without charging them with a crime. Did I get that roughly correct? Judge ALITO. Yes, that’s exactly correct. Eighteen U.S.C. 4001, which is called the anti-detention statute, says that nobody may be detained without authorization, and in Hamdi, Justice O’Connor’s opinion concluded that the authorization for the use of military

448
force constituted statutory authorization to detain a person who had been taken prisoner as an unlawful combatant in Afghanistan.
Senator CORNYN. Well, I appreciate you pointing out that one of the other important statements in Hamdi was that people who are detained have certain due process rights and that the President cannot exercise his powers as Commander in Chief without judicial review or without anyone else looking at it, including a court or military tribunal under appropriate circumstances. But the fact is, Justice O’Connor took a view of Presidential power there that some might consider to be rather broad, the power to detain an American citizen who is a suspected terrorist without actually charging them with a crime for the reasons that Senator Graham stated, that if that person who was actually captured in Afghanistan and brought to Guantanamo Bay, if they were released, then they likely would return to the battlefield and plot and plan and execute lethal attacks on American citizens.
Interestingly, people like to characterize judges as conservative or liberal. One interesting thing to me about that is Justice Scalia, who you have been likened to, actually dissented and held that it was unconstitutional for the President to detain these individuals without charging them with some crime, like treason or something else, isn’t that correct, sir?
Judge ALITO. Yes, that’s correct. This is a case where Justice O’Connor’s view of the scope of Executive power was broader, considerably broader, than Justice Scalia’s. Justice Scalia’s position was that unless habeas corpus is suspended, and there are only limited circumstances in which that can take place, then there would have to be a criminal trial.
Senator CORNYN. Judge Scalito, my—Alito, excuse me. After talking about Judge Scalia—you know what I was thinking in the back of my mind, a nickname that you have acquired sometimes, and I apologize.
But the fact is that people try to characterize judges as being somewhere on the political spectrum or making results-oriented decisions based on some ideology. But the fact is, and I will just ask you if you agree with this, whether good judges who try to apply the law to cases and facts that come before them on an individual basis without regard to who wins and who loses, their decisions could be characterized as liberal, conservative, and anywhere in between. Has that been your experience?
Judge ALITO. I think that is correct, Senator. I think that all these labels when you are trying to describe how judges behave, how they do their work, have their limitations and different people use them in different ways.
Senator CORNYN. Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Well, thank you very much, Senator Cornyn, for that round of questions. When Senator Cornyn misstates even one word, with his competency, you know it is getting late. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Judge Alito, for your—we can all agree, there may be some areas of controversy among the 18 of us, but I think we can all agree about your stamina and your poise and your good humor and even some subtle humor.

Your family has shown the same kind of stamina. The crowd has pretty well emptied out, but the Alitos are all still here and they have provided not only support but occasion for a comment or two. I noticed a big smile on your wife’s face when you were asked if you stopped beating your wife.
[Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I wasn’t asked whether she had stopped beating me. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Now that is some of that subtle humor that your profiles talk about. We would like to see a little more of it, Judge. Perhaps if we went 11 hours instead of 10 hours, we would get to that. Senator LEAHY. Oh, please don’t. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. I have been vastly— Senator LEAHY. I will certify that he is very, very funny. Just don’t do the other two hours. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. That raises the question as to what else you will certify to, Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. That is enough for today. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. I want to make one comment, which I have been pondering as to whether I ought to make it, but there is a story which is inapplicable to you, Judge Alito, so I think I can make it. The question is always raised, who is behind a successful man, and the answer is a surprised mother-in-law. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. But you have negated that infrequently told story. So I want to thank you for your testimony today and I want to thank my colleagues for what we are proceeding to do here in accordance with our commitment to have a full, fair, and dignified hearing. I think we are on the way. These proceedings are being very broadly covered. You can’t pick up the front page of any newspaper in America without seeing your smiling face, Judge. In an era where the media is filled with criticism about the Congress, I think it is a good day for the U.S. Congress to have these proceedings because people have been watching them and they see long hours and they see seriousness and they see important issues and they see the kind of dignity which we have had here today. I thank my colleagues and I thank you, Judge Alito. We will resume this hearing tomorrow morning at 9:30. [Whereupon, at 7:03 p.m., the Committee was adjourned, to reconvene on Wednesday, January 11, 2006, at 9:30 a.m.]

NOMINATION OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 11, 2006
U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:30 a.m., in room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman SPECTER. The Judiciary Committee will now proceed with the confirmation hearing for Judge Alito for the Supreme Court of the United States. Welcome back, Judge Alito. We have three members who have not had their first round of questioning of 30 minutes, and we will proceed there, and then we will have a second round of questioning for 20 minutes each. I expect we will need to work a long day today. It is my hope that we might finish the questioning of Judge Alito. That might be overly optimistic, but we will see how things go. Senator Durbin, you are recognized for 30 minutes. Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator LEAHY. Before we start the clock on Senator Durbin, if I might say on the questions, one, I admire the stamina both of the nominee and his family, but a number of us have been troubled by what we see as inconsistencies in some of the answers, and we are going to want to go into those in some depth, on the issue of one person/one vote, Vanguard recusal, unitary theory of Government, CAP and so on. I want to clear up in my mind and in the minds of many over here what we see as inconsistencies. I know many have announced up here exactly how they are going to vote before they even ask questions. I am one of the one who likes to make up my mind after asking the questions, so there will be a number more. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. I appreciate the comment. There are many issues. Judge Alito has responded for about 71⁄2 hours so far, and we are going to have another hour and a half on opening statements, and then with each Senator having 20 minutes on a second round, six more hours. So we will see if

he has covered the waterfront, and this will be a full and fair hearing. We will give every opportunity to ask the questions.
Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, with you as Chairman, I know it will be a full and fair hearing, and that is one thing that every single Democrat on this side is aware of.
Chairman SPECTER. I think that is very important for the nominee, for the Committee and for the country, and we will do that. The adjunct to full, fair is dignified, and I think so far we are on track.
OK, Senator Durbin, keep us on track. Senator Durbin is recognized. We will start the clock at 30 minutes.
Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, thank you for coming for the second day and not quite the end of the first round. I thank your family for their patience, listening to all of our questions, and I hope that at the end of the day we will feel that we have really added something to the process of choosing a person to serve in a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in our land. I listened to you carefully yesterday address an issue which is very important to me, the Griswold case, because I think that it is a starting point for me when it comes to appointments to the Supreme Court. If I had any doubt in my mind that a Supreme Court nominee recognized the basic right of privacy of American citizens as articulated in Griswold, I could not support the nominee. And I listened as you explained that you supported that right of privacy and that you found the Griswold decision grounded in the Fifth Amendment as well as the 14th Amendment. I would ask you at this point—you obviously support Brown v. Board of Education, do you, and the finding of the Court in that? Judge ALITO. Certainly, Senator. Senator DURBIN. Do you believe that the Constitution protects the right of children in America to be educated in schools that are not segregated? Judge ALITO. Absolutely, Senator. That was one of the greatest, if not the single greatest thing that the Supreme Court of the United States has ever done. Senator DURBIN. As you read that Supreme Court decision, that historic decision, they find the basis for that decision was the Equal Protection Clause of our Constitution. Judge ALITO. Yes, they did, and that was, I think—of course, we fought a Civil War to get the 14th Amendment and to adopt the constitutional principle of equality for people of all races. Senator DURBIN. The reason I ask you about those two cases is that neither of those cases referred to explicit language in the Constitution. Those cases were based on concepts of equality and liberty within our Constitution, and the Griswold case took that concept of liberty and said it means privacy, though the word is not in our Constitution, and the Brown v. Board of Education case took the concept of equality, equal protection, and said, that means public education will not be segregated. I raise that because I listened carefully as Senator Schumer asked you yesterday about Roe v. Wade, and I could not understand your conclusion. You conceded the fact that we have free speech because it is explicit in our Constitution, a protected constitutional right, and yet, when Senator

Schumer asked you repeatedly, ‘‘Do you find that Roe v. Wade established and recognized a constitutional protection for a woman to make this most private decision,’’ you would not answer. You would not give a direct answer. On two Supreme Court cases, Griswold and Brown now, you have said, just as we started this hearing, that you believe there is a constitutional basis for this protection and for this right, and yet when it came to Roe v. Wade you would not.
Most of us are troubled by this 1985 memo. You said yesterday you would have an open mind when it came to this issue. I am sorry to report that your memo seeking a job in the Reagan administration does not evidence an open mind. It evidences a mind that, sadly, is closed in some areas. Yesterday when you were asked about one man/one vote, you clarified it, said those were my views then, they are not my views now. When Senator Kohl asked you about the power and authority of elected branches as opposed to others, no, you said, I want to clarify that is not my view now.
And yet, when we have tried to press you on this critical statement that you made in that application, a statement which was made by you that said the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you have been unwilling to distance yourself and to say that you disagree with that. I think this is critically important, because as far as I am concerned, Judge Alito, we have to rely on the Supreme Court to protect our rights and freedoms, especially our right to privacy. For you to say that you are for Griswold, you accept the constitutional basis for Griswold, but you cannot bring yourself to say there is a constitutional basis for the right of a woman’s privacy when she is making a tragic, painful decision about continuing a pregnancy that may risk her health or her life, I am troubled by that.
Why can you say unequivocally that you find constitutional support for Griswold, unequivocally you find constitutional support for Brown, but cannot bring yourself to say that you find constitutional support for a woman’s right to choose?
Judge ALITO. Brown v. Board of Education, as you pointed out, is based on the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, and the 14th Amendment, of course, was adopted and ratified after the Civil War. It talks about equality. It talks about equal protection of the law, and the principle that was finally recognized in Brown v. Board of Education, after nearly a century of misapplication of the 14th Amendment, is that denying people the opportunity, people of a particular race the opportunity to attend schools, or for that matter, to make use of other public facilities that are open to people of a different race, denies them equality. They’re not treated the same way. An African-American is not treated the same way as a white person when they’re treated that way, so they’re denied equality, and that is based squarely on the language of the Equal Protection Clause and on the principle, the principle that was—the magnificent principle that emerged from this great struggle that is embodied in the Equal Protection Clause.
Griswold concerned the marital right to privacy, and when the decision was handed down, it was written by Justice Douglas, and he based that on his theories of—his theory of emanations and pe-

454
numbras from various constitutional provisions, the Ninth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment, and a variety of others, but it has been understood in later cases as based on the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, which says that no person shall be denied due process—shall be denied liberty without due process of law. And that’s my understanding of it.
And the issue that was involved in Griswold, the possession of contraceptives by married people, is not an issue that is likely to come before the courts again. It’s not likely to come before the Third Circuit, it’s not likely to come before the Supreme Court, so I feel an ability to comment, a greater ability to comment on that than I do on an issue that is involved in litigation.
And what I have said about Roe is that if the issue were to come before me if I am confirmed, and I’m on the Supreme Court, and the issue comes up, the first step in the analysis for me would be the issue of stare decisis, and that would be very important. The things that I said in the 1985 memo were a true expression of my views at the time from my vantage point as an attorney in the Solicitor General’s Office, but that was 20 years ago, and a great deal has happened in the case law since then. Thornburgh was decided, and then Webster and then Casey and a number of other decisions. So the stare decisis analysis would have to take account of that entire line of case law.
And then if I got beyond that, I would approach the question— and of course in Casey, that was the beginning and the ending point of the analysis in the joint opinion. If I were to get beyond that, I would approach that question the way I approach every legal issue that I approach as a judge, and that is to approach it with an open mind, and to go through the whole judicial process which is designed—and I believe strongly in it—to achieve good results, to achieve good decisionmaking.
Senator DURBIN. This is what troubles me, that you do not see Roe as a natural extension of Griswold, that you do not see the privacy rights of Griswold ended by the decision in Roe, that you decided to create categories of cases that have been decided by the Court that you will concede have constitutional protection, but you have left in question the future of Roe v. Wade.
Yesterday, Senator Specter asked you, as he asked John Roberts before you, a series of questions about whether or not you accept the concept that this is somehow a precedent that we can rely on, that is embedded in our experience, that if it were changed it would call into question the legitimacy of the Court, and time and time again he brought you to the edge, hoping that you would agree, and rarely if ever did you acknowledge that you would agree. You made the most general statement that you believe reliance was part of stare decisis.
But let me just ask you this. John Roberts said that Roe v. Wade is the settled law of the land. Do you believe it is the settled law of the land?
Judge ALITO. Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of the Supreme Court. It was decided in 1973, so it has been on the books for a long time. It has been challenged on a number of occasions, and I discussed those yesterday, and the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the decision, sometimes on the merits, sometimes in Casey

based on stare decisis, and I think that when a decision is challenged and it is reaffirmed that strengthens its value as stare decisis for at least two reasons. First of all, the more often a decision is reaffirmed, the more people tend to rely on it, and second, I think stare decisis reflects the view that there is wisdom embedded in decisions that have been made by prior Justices who take the same oath and are scholars and are conscientious, and when they examine a question and they reach a conclusion, I think that’s entitled to considerable respect, and of course, the more times that happens, the more respect the decision is entitled to, and that’s my view of that. So it is a very important precedent that—
Senator DURBIN. Is it the settled law of the land? Judge ALITO. It is a—if settled means that it can’t be re-examined, then that’s one thing. If settled means that it is a precedent that is entitled to respect as stare decisis, and all of the factors that I’ve mentioned come into play, including the reaffirmation and all of that, then it is a precedent that is protected, entitled to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis in that way. Senator DURBIN. How do you see it? Judge ALITO. I have explained, Senator, as best I can how I see it. It is a precedent that has now been on the books for several decades. It has been challenged. It has been reaffirmed, but it is an issue that is involved in litigation now at all levels. There is an abortion case before the Supreme Court this term. There are abortion cases in the lower courts. I’ve sat on three of them on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. I’m sure there are others in other courts of appeals, or working their way toward the courts of appeals right now, so it’s an issue that is involved in a considerable amount of litigation that is going on. Senator DURBIN. I would say, Judge Alito, this is a painful issue for most of us. It is a difficult issue for most of us. The act of abortion itself is many times a hard decision, a sad decision, a tragic decision. I believe that for 30 years we have tried to strike a balance in this country to say it is a legal procedure, but it should be discouraged. It should be legal but rare, and we should try to find ways to reduce the incidence of abortion. But as I listen to the way that you have answered this question this morning and yesterday, and the fact that you have refused to refute that statement in the 1985 job application, I am concerned. I am concerned that many people will leave this hearing with a question as to whether or not you could be the deciding vote that would eliminate the legality of abortion, that would make it illegal in this country, would criminalize the conduct of women who are seeking to terminate pregnancies for fear of their lives and the conduct of doctors who help them. That is very troubling, particularly because you have stated that you are committed to this right of privacy. If I could move to another issue that came up yesterday, I did not understand your answer to one question and I want to clarify it. This so-called Concerned Alumni of Princeton. You noted in your application for a job with the Department of Justice you belonged to two organizations, the Federalist Society and the Concerned Alumni of Princeton. I will not get into Federalist Society, because every time I say those words they go into a rage that I am some-

456
how guilty of McCarthy-like tactics, asking who are these people in the Federalist Society? I will not touch it.
Let me just go to the Concerned Alumni of Princeton. I did not understand your answer. Your answer said something about ROTC being discontinued at Princeton University. I know you were involved in ROTC. I am told that by the time you filled out this application, ROTC had been restored. I do not believe you were suggesting that bringing more women and minorities to Princeton would somehow jeopardize the future of ROTC. I do not know that that is the case.
But there is a woman named Diane Weeks, who was a colleague of yours in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office, and she said that she was troubled by your membership in this group. She said you had a first-rate legal mind, but here is what she went on to say. ‘‘When I saw Concerned Alumni of Princeton on that 1985 job application, I was flabbergasted,’’ she said. ‘‘I was totally stunned. I couldn’t believe it. CAP made it clear to women like me that we were not wanted on campus, and he is touting his membership in this group in 1985, 13 years after he graduated? He’s not a young man by this point,’’ she said, ‘‘and I don’t buy for a second that he was doing it just to get a job. Membership in CAP gives a good sense of what someone’s personal beliefs are. I’m very troubled by this, and if I were in the Senate, I would want some answers.’’
I don’t think explaining discontinuing ROTC at Princeton is an answer. What is your answer? Why did you include this controversial organization as one of your qualifications for being part of the Reagan administration? As you said, with your background, with your immigrant background and the fact that Princeton had just started allowing people of your background as students, how could you identify with a group that would discriminate against women and minorities?
Judge ALITO. Well, Diane Weeks was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey, and somebody that I hired, and one of many women whom I hired when I was U.S. Attorney, and I think that illustrates my attitude toward equality for women.
I’ve said what I can say about what I can recall about this group, Senator, which is virtually nothing. I put it down on the ‘85 form as a group in which I was a member. I didn’t say I was anything more than a member. And since I put it down, I’m sure that I was a member at the time, but I’m also sure—and I have racked my memory on this—that if I had participated in the group in any active way, if I had attended meetings or done anything else substantial in connection with this group, I would remember it, and if I had renewed my membership, for example, over a period of years, I’m sure I would remember that. So that’s the best I can reconstruct as to what happened with this group.
I mentioned, in wracking my memory about this, I said, what would it have been, what could it have been about the administration of Princeton that would have caused me to sign up to be a member of this group around the time of this application? And I don’t have a specific recollection, but I do know that the issue of ROTC has bothered me for a long period of time. The expulsion of

457
the units at the time when I was a student there, struck me as a very bad thing for Princeton to do.
Senator DURBIN. Do women and minorities have anything to do with that?
Judge ALITO. No, and I did not join this group, I’m quite confident, because of any attitude toward women or minorities. What has bothered me about—what bothered me about the Princeton administration over a period of time was the treatment of ROTC, and after the unit was brought back, I know there’s been a continuing controversy over a period of years about whether it would be kept on campus, whether in any way this was demeaning to the university to have an ROTC unit on campus, whether students who were enrolled in ROTC could receive credit for the courses, whether the members of—whether the ROTC instructors could be considered in any way a part of the faculty. All of this bothered me, and it is my recollection that it continued over a period of time.
Senator DURBIN. Let me ask you, if I might, to reflect on a couple other things. You are a Bruce Springsteen fan?
Judge ALITO. I am to some degree, yes. Senator DURBIN. I guess most people in New Jersey would be, they should be. Judge ALITO. There was the movement sometime ago—we don’t have an official State song, and there was a movement to make ‘‘Born to Run’’ our official State song, but it didn’t quite make it. Senator DURBIN. We will stick with Lincoln in Illinois, but I can understand your commitment to Bruce Springsteen. They once asked him, ‘‘How do you come up with the songs that you write and the characters that are in them?’’ And he said, ‘‘I have a familiarity with the crushing hand of fate.’’ It is a great line. I want to ask you about the crushing hand of fate in several of your decisions. Riley v. Taylor. This cas involved the murder conviction of an African-American defendant, and the question was raised as to whether he had a fair trial, and the people who argued in his defense said that when we take a look at the various people who were involved in these jury pools in the murder cases here, we find that the local prosecutors had eliminated all the African-Americans in four murder trials that had taken place during the year that led up to his trial. And they raised the question in his case whether there had been a conscious effort to eliminate AfricanAmerican jurors in this case involving an African-American defendant. And you dismissed the statistical evidence of these all-white juries, and you made a statement that said the significance of an allwhite jury was as relevant as the fact that five of the past six Presidents of the United States have been left-handed. That is a troubling analogy, and I am not the only one troubled. Your colleagues on the Third Circuit were troubled as well. Here is what they said: ‘‘The dissent’’—your dissent—‘‘has overlooked the obvious fact that there is no provision in the Constitution that protects persons from discrimination based on whether they are righthanded or left-handed. To suggest any comparability to striking of jurors based on their race is to minimize the history of discrimination against prospective black jurors and black defendants.’’

Why did you use that analogy that apparently is so inappropriate?
Judge ALITO. Well, the analogy went to the issue of statistics and the use and misuse of statistics and the fact that statistics can be quite misleading. Statistics are very powerful, but statistics can also be very misleading, and that’s what that was referring to. There’s a whole—I mean, statistics is a branch of mathematics, and there are ways to analyze statistics so that you draw sound conclusions from them and avoid erroneous conclusions from them. Sometimes when you see a pattern, it’s the result of a cause, and sometimes when you see something that looks like it might be a pattern, it’s the result of chance.
Riley was a very, very difficult case, and I can tell you I struggled over that case because the issue of racial discrimination in the criminal justice system is an issue of enormous importance. Obviously, it’s very important for the defendant. It’s important for the society so that everybody knows that everyone in this country is treated equally regardless of race. And it’s important for law enforcement, because I know from years as a prosecutor that nothing is a greater poison for law enforcement than even the slightest hint of unfairness.
The issue of racial discrimination in the jury had to be viewed by our court and by me under the habeas corpus statute that Congress passed, and that gave us an important role to play, but a very limited role. The Pennsylvania—and what the habeas corpus statute is that if the State courts have decided a question on the merits and they’ve applied the correct legal standard, the correct constitutional standard, we can’t authorize a granting of a writ of habeas corpus unless they were unreasonable. It’s not enough for us to say, ‘‘We don’t agree with it.’’ We have to say, ‘‘You were unreasonable.’’
Now, I think seven members of the Pennsylvania judiciary—well, I think there were more. There was the judge who heard the State habeas case and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, as I recall, was unanimous on the issue that there hadn’t been racial discrimination in the selection of the jury in the case.
Then the case came up to us, and the issue was whether the State courts were unreasonable in finding that the particular peremptory challenges at issue in this case were not based on race. And it was a tough question, but I didn’t see how we could overturn what they had done under the habeas standard. Now—
Senator DURBIN. I would just say, Judge, in many of these tough questions as I read through your cases, you end up ruling in favor of established institutions and against individuals. Let me tell you another one, Pirolli v. World Flavors. Remember this case? A mentally retarded individual, Kenneth Pirolli, physically harassed at his workplace, subjected to a hostile, abusive work environment, and sexually assaulted by his coworkers. According to his deposition testimony, he said they attempted to rape him.
I could read to you what is in that record here, but it is so graphic and it tells in such detail the sexual assault that he was subjected to that I am not going to read it into the record. But I bet you remember it.

459
And when it came to whether or not he should have a trial, as to whether he was entitled to bring his case before a jury, you said no, stand by the summary judgment, don’t take this to a jury. You dissented from the majority position here. And the reason you dissented was, I think, significant. It wasn’t about Kenneth Pirolli or the merits of his case. It was about the conduct and efforts of his lawyer.
You noted the fact that his lawyer had not adequately provided citations in his brief to places in the record describing the harassment. So you held Kenneth Pirolli responsible for the fact that his lawyer didn’t do a good job—at least in your view—and denied him his day in court. How do you explain that crushing hand of fate on this man who was a victim of sexual harassment?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, the district court thought that the defendant in that case was entitled to summary—was entitled to summary judgment, and so I think that says something about the facts of the case and whether it was a particularly strong case.
There’s a very important principle involved in the appellate practice, and I think it goes with the idea of judicial self-restraint. It is that certain things are to be decided at certain levels in the court system, and that requires that parties raise issues in the trial court; and that if they do not raise the issue in the trial court, then absent some extraordinary circumstances, they shouldn’t be able to raise the issue on appeal. And that was the principle there.
Now, this was not a criminal case. In a criminal case, there’s a constitutional right to counsel, and so a person can claim ineffective assistance of counsel. And we treat that issue differently in criminal cases than we do in civil cases.
Senator DURBIN. I would just say that you are arguing on the merits of the district court decision. Your statement in dissent criticized his lawyer for the brief that they presented to your court. That seems to me to be an unfair treatment of a man who I think deserved a day in court.
Let me ask you about another group looking for a day in court, the RNS Services v. Secretary of Labor case that I referred to in my opening statement. It is a timely case. It is about mine safety. You know what happened in West Virginia a few days ago and yesterday in the State of Kentucky where there are serious questions being raised about whether there is adequate mine safety. And in this case, there was a question as to whether or not the Federal and State mine safety provisions applied to a company in a certain activity. And you concluded they did not apply. You concluded that you would narrowly construe the statute passed by Congress, and in construing it in that way, that the requirements of inspecting this mine location would not be subject to Federal law.
Again, you dissented and you ruled on the side of the company, on the side of the established institution, against the coal miners and against the workers in this circumstance. It is a recurring pattern. The crushing hand of fate here seems to always come down against the workers and the consumers and in favor of these established institutions and corporations.
How would you explain the fact that you would so narrowly construe a statute when you knew that the lives and safety of coal miners were at stake?

Judge ALITO. The facility that was involved in that case was not a mine as a lay person would think of a mine. It wasn’t an underground facility. It wasn’t like the facility in West Virginia where the terrible accident occurred a few days ago. It was basically a pile of coal that was being loaded onto trucks to be transported to another place. The definition of a mine under the Federal law is very broad, and it’s not limited to what ordinary people would think of as a mine. And there was an argument that this facility, which, as I said, as I recall, was basically a big pile of coal on top of the ground and coal was being hauled away to a cogeneration facility. Is that a mine? An ordinary person would look at that and say that’s not a mine, that’s a pile of coal.
But the issue in the case was the kind of technical issue of interpretation that we get all the time, and the question was is this a mine in the sense of the law, and I thought it was not a mine in the sense of the law.
Now, that conclusion, I don’t believe, would mean that this facility would be spared safety regulation at either the Federal or local level. It’s been a long time since I worked on that case, but I would imagine that if the facility is not governed by the Federal mining laws, it would be covered by OSHA, by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and perhaps by State law. So the issue would not be whether this facility would be allowed, which was not a mine in the ordinary sense, would be allowed to operate in an unsafe fashion. It was which body of laws and regulations would govern the facility.
Senator DURBIN. Judge, I would say that your opinion did not prevail. The two other judges, both Reagan appointees, who saw this case on the side of the workers, understood that the wording of the law is as follows: ‘‘Congress declares that the first priority and concern of all in the coal or other mining industry must be the safety and health of its most precious resource—the miner.’’ And instead of taking the obvious interpretation that these were people working in the mining industry, even if they were outside of the underground mine and the danger that it presents, you drew this statute as narrowly as you could—construed it as narrowly as you could to take the company position here that the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration did not have jurisdiction.
I find this as a recurring pattern, and it raises a question in my mind whether the average person, the dispossessed person, the poor person who finally had their day in court and may make it all the way through the process to the Supreme Court, are going to be subject to the crushing hand of fate when it comes to your decisions. They have been many times at the Third Circuit, and that is a concern which I will continue when we have further questions in the next round.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Do you care to respond, Judge Alito? Judge ALITO. Yes, could I just say a couple of words? That case was a case of statutory interpretation and applying the statute, and that’s how I thought it came out. There have been many other cases that I have worked on on the court of appeals where I have come out in favor of the small person who was challenging a big institution, and I could mention a number of them.

Let me just mention Shore v. Regional High School because I think it has some relation to the Pirolli case, which you mentioned. This was a case in which a high school student had been bullied unmercifully by other students in his school because of their perception of his sexual orientation. He had been bullied to the point of attempting to commit suicide, and his parents wanted to enroll him at an adjacent public high school, and the school board said, no, you can’t do that. And I wrote an opinion upholding their right to have him placed in a safe school in an adjacent municipality.
That is just one example, but all of these cases involve what judges are supposed to do, which is to take the law and apply it to the particular facts of the case that is before them.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Alito. Senator Brownback? Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Judge Alito, Mrs. Alito, family members. Good to have you here. I have got a number of areas I would like to ask you questions about, and I am hopeful we can get through them and maybe reduce the need of time in a second round, which would probably be pleasing to your ears. I want to first go at this area, because it seems to keep coming up, that I think is really not applicable and not reflective of your record that you always take the side of the big institution and against the little guy, as you just stated. But then I want to get into a number of areas of constitutional law, some of which you have written on, religious freedom type cases, takings cases. I would like to get into some of these areas. But I want to enter into the record, Mr. Chairman, a letter from a former law clerk of yours, David Walk, dated January 6, 2006. David worked with you in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office. I don’t know if you remember David or not. Judge ALITO. I do. He was a fine— Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you. He is a lifelong Democrat, former member of the ACLU, and talks about how fair you were to everybody’s rights. But then he cites the case of Franklin Igbonwa. This was a Nigerian set to be deported for drug dealing who had testified against other Nigerian drug dealers and was fearful of being deported, that he would be killed once back in Nigeria. The other two judges said his case— he shouldn’t be believed on the face of it, and you said he should and that the trial court should have given more deference to this Nigerian to be deported. This was somebody that David Walk represented. Talk about a little guy in a case, and that is one that is cited in this particular record and letter that I would hope my colleague from Illinois could take a chance at, because it is a legitimate point of view. And saying, well, it looks like you always take one side or the other, here is where another side was taken. And then here is a letter from another individual who worked with you, Cathy Fleming, lifelong Democrat, president-elect, National Women’s Bar Association, gives an unqualified endorsement of you. She says, ‘‘By providing my credentials as an outspoken

women’s rights advocate and liberal-minded criminal defense attorney, I hope you will appreciate the significance of my unqualified and enthusiastic recommendation of Sam Alito for the Supreme Court.’’
I think one can kind of look in the past and try to say, well, OK, there is this problem, there is that, but then when people that know you well put their names to letters saying differently, I think that’s also something we should consider, and I would ask that that letter be put into the record as well.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.
Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you. Judge Alito, the Supreme Court has gotten a number of things wrong at times, too. That would be correct, and the answer when the Court gets things wrong is to overturn the case. That is the way it works. Isn’t that correct? Judge ALITO. Well, when the Court gets something wrong and there’s a prior precedent, then you have to analyze the doctrine of stare decisis. It is an important doctrine, and I have said a lot about it, but— Senator BROWNBACK. Wait, let me just ask you, was Plessy wrong, Plessy v. Ferguson? Judge ALITO. Plessy was certainly wrong. Senator BROWNBACK. OK, and you have gone through this. Brown v. Board of Education, which is in my hometown of Topeka, Kansas. I was there last year at the dedication of the schoolhouse. Fifty years ago, that overturned Plessy. Plessy had stood on the books since 1896. I don’t know if you knew the number. And I have got a chart up here. It was depended upon by a number of people for a long period of time. You have got it sitting on the books for 60 years, twice the length of time of Roe v. Wade. You have got these number of cases that considered Plessy and upheld Plessy to the dependency. And yet Brown comes along, 1950s case, poor little girl has to walk by the all-white school to go to the black school in Topeka, Kansas. And the Court looks at this and they say unanimously that is just not right. Now, stare decisis would say in the Brown case you should uphold Plessy. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. It certainly would be a factor that you would consider in determining whether to overrule it. Senator BROWNBACK. But obviously— Judge ALITO. A doctrine that you would consider. Senator BROWNBACK. Obviously, Brown over turned it, and thank goodness it did. Correct? Judge ALITO. Certainly. Senator BROWNBACK. It overturned all these super duper precedents that had been depended upon in this case because the Court got it wrong in Plessy. Is that correct? Judge ALITO. The Court certainly got it wrong in Plessy, and it got it spectacularly wrong in Plessy, and it took a long time for that erroneous decision to be overruled. One of things I think that people should have understood is that separate facilities, even if they were absolutely equal in every re-

463
spect, even if they were identical, could never give people equal treatment under the law.
Senator BROWNBACK. They don’t. Judge ALITO. I think they should have recognized that. But one of the things that was illustrated in those cases—and Sweatt v. Painter, the last one on the list brought that out—was that, in fact, the facilities, the supposedly equal facilities were never equal, and the continuing series of litigation that was brought by the NAACP to challenge racial discrimination illustrated—if the illustration was needed, the litigation illustrated that, in fact, the facilities that were supposedly equal were not equal. And that was an important factor, I think, in leading to the decision in Brown v. Board of Education Senator BROWNBACK. I want to give you another number, and that is, in over 200 other cases, the Court has revisited and revised earlier judgments. In other words, in some portion or in all of the cases, the Court got it wrong in some 200 cases. And thank goodness the Court is willing to review various cases. I want to give you an example of a couple, though, that the Court hasn’t reviewed yet that I think are spectacularly wrong. The 1927 case of Buck v. Bell, I don’t know if you are familiar with that case. The Court examined a Virginia statute that permitted the sterilization of the mentally impaired. Carrie Buck, a patient at the socalled Virginia State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble Minded, was scheduled to be sterilized after doctors alleged she was a genetic threat to the population due to her diminished mental capacity. Buck’s guardian challenged the decision to have Carrie sterilized all the way to the Supreme Court, but in an 8–1 decision, the Court found that it was in the State’s interest to have her sterilized. The majority opinion written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said, ‘‘We have seen more than once that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives. It would be strange if it could not call upon those who already sap the strength of the State for these lesser sacrifices, often not felt to be such by those concerned, in order to prevent our being swamped with incompetence.’’ Clearly, some precedents are undeserving of respect because they are repugnant to the Constitution. Isn’t Plessy repugnant to the Constitution? Judge ALITO. It certainly was repugnant to the Equal Protection Clause. Senator BROWNBACK. And the vision of human dignity, isn’t Buck and those sort of statements by Oliver Wendell Holmes repugnant to the Constitution? Judge ALITO. I think they are repugnant to the traditions of our country. I don’t think there is any question about that. Senator BROWNBACK. I will give you another case, the Korematsu v. United States case, a 1944 case. World War II broke out following Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor. Feelings spread that Japanese-Americans, both naturalized and those born in the United States, might not be loyal to the United States and should be removed from the West Coast. So great was the fear that even the esteemed writer Walter Lippmann stated that, ‘‘Nobody’s constitutional rights include the right to reside and do business on a

464
battlefield. There is plenty of room elsewhere for him to exercise his rights.’’
President Roosevelt signed an Executive order removing them. Korematsu contested the constitutionality, Fred Korematsu did, of his internment. In Korematsu v. the United States, the Supreme Court held that military necessity justified the internment program and that Fred Korematsu had no protection against relocation under the Constitution.
Of course, that was later overturned—excuse me, that was never overturned. In 1948, Congress enacted the Japanese American Evacuation Claims Act to provide some monetary compensation. In 1980, Congress again revisited the case. In 1988, Congress passed legislation apologizing for the internment and awarded each survivor $20,000. In 1999, Fred Korematsu was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor that anyone can receive. Justice has not been done because Korematsu remains on the books. It is still on the books.
Roe v. Wade. You have had every question on that, but I want to point out its difficulty. My colleagues on the other side look at this as completely settled law, but let’s see what the legal experts say about how settled it is.
Laurence Tribe, who will be here to testify, I believe, probably against you in a little bit. Let’s see what he says, a professor of law at Harvard: ‘‘One of the most curious things about Roe is that, behind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found.’’ Settled law? Super duper precedents? Laurence Tribe has some questions about it.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: ‘‘Roe, I believe, would have been more acceptable as a judicial decision if it had not gone beyond a ruling on the extreme statute before the Court. Heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict.’’ Provoked, not resolved, conflict—one of your potential colleagues says.
Edward Lazarus, former clerk to Chief Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote Roe: ‘‘As a matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, Roe borders on the indefensible. I say this as someone utterly committed to the right to choose, as someone who believes such a right was grounded elsewhere in the Constitution, instead of where Roe placed it, and as someone who loved Roe’s author like a grandfather.’’ Settled law? Edward Lazarus has some questions about it being settled.
Let’s look at John Hart Ely, former Dean of Stanford Law School, excellent law school in the country, one of the top law schools in the country: Roe v. Wade ‘‘is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be. What is frightening about Roe is that this super-protected right is not inferable from the language of the Constitution, the Framers’ thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the Nation’s governmental structure.’’ John Hart Ely. Do you think he thinks Roe is settled law? Not constitutional and gives no sense of an obligation to try to be.
Alan Dershowitz, professor of law, Harvard Law School, one of the top law schools in the country. It is not Princeton, but... Roe v. Wade and Bush v. Gore ‘‘represent opposite sides of the same

currency of judicial activism in areas more appropriately left to the political process. Judges have no special competency, qualifications, or mandate to decide between equally compelling moral claims, as in the abortion controversy. Clear governing constitutional principles are not present in either case.’’ Settled law? Super duper precedents?
I think there are places where the Court gets it wrong, and hopefully they will continue to be willing to revisit it.
Now I want to look at a couple of areas of law in addition to this. Your view of the Constitution—and yesterday you hit at this, I thought, on some of the edges, but I just want to get your thoughts of how you view the Constitution, how you would review it. There are these different schools of thought on this of strict constructionist, living document, originalist, and there are several others that float around out there. How do you generally look at the Constitution? And I am aware yesterday you were saying that some provisions are very clear and some are not, and you seem to apply a different set of viewpoints on those of the Constitution. Could you articulate your view of how you look and interpret the Constitution?
Judge ALITO. First of all, Senator, I think the Constitution means something, and I don’t think it means whatever I might want it to mean or whatever any other member of the judiciary might want it to mean. It has its own meaning, and it is the job of a judge, the job of a Supreme Court Justice, to interpret the Constitution, not distort the Constitution, not add to the Constitution or subtract from the Constitution.
In interpreting the Constitution, I think we should proceed in the way we proceed in interpreting other important legal authorities. In interpreting statutes, for example, I think we should look to the text of the Constitution and we should look to the meaning that someone would have taken from the text of the Constitution at the time of its adoption. But I think we have to recognize that the Constitution is very different from statutes in some important respects. Statutes are often very detailed, and they generally don’t exist without revision for very long periods of time. The Constitution was adopted to endure throughout the history of our country, and considering how long our country has existed, it’s been amended relatively few times. And the magic of that, I think, is that it sets out a basic structure for our Government and protects fundamental rights. But on a number of very important issues, I think the Framers recognized that times would change, new questions would come up, and so they didn’t purport to adopt a detailed code, for example, governing searches and seizures. That was the example I gave yesterday, and I will come back to it. They could have set out a detailed code of search and seizure. They didn’t do that. They said that the people are protected against unreasonable searches and seizures, and they left it for the courts—and, of course, the legislative body can supplement this—to apply that principle to the new situations that come up.
Now, when that is done, that doesn’t amount to an amendment of the Constitution or a changing of the Constitution. It amounts to—it involves the application of a constitutional principle to the situation at hand.

Senator BROWNBACK. Let me go to a specific area you have written quite a bit about, and that is on religious liberties and free exercise. And I have looked at these cases, and this is going to be an active area of law in front of the Supreme Court. It has been for the last 40 years.
You wrote the case of ACLU v. Schundler, a Third Circuit case, considered—it is an ACLU challenge to religious displays erected by Jersey City on the Plaza of City Hall. Jersey City for decades had had holiday displays of a menorah and Christmas tree. Litigation resulted in permanent pulling of this. The city came back and said, OK, if that is not good enough, we will put a nativity scene, a menorah, a Christmas tree, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus, Kwanzaa symbols, and signs explaining the display. So, OK, if two is not enough, we will add more into it, and they were again challenged by the ACLU. The district court found no constitutional violation.
A panel of the Third Circuit, not including you, reversed that decision. The panel found no basis for the demystification approach, as they put it, and expressed skepticism as to constitutional display.
On remand, the district court held that there was a constitutional violation. The city appealed. You sat on the panel that heard that appeal. In a 2–1 decision, you upheld the constitutionality of the modified display.
In your decision, you specifically cited Justice O’Connor and two particular issues regarding excessive entanglement with religious institutions and Government endorsement or disapproval of religion. Because Justice O’Connor used these factors to uphold similar displays in prior cases, you applied them to your upholding in that case. That is a correct interpretation. Is that correct, Judge Alito?
Judge ALITO. Yes, it is, Senator. Senator BROWNBACK. Because these are coming up so much in front of the Court, are these types of displays, you feel, generally constitutionally permissible? Judge ALITO. Well, this is an area in which the Supreme Court has handed down several decisions, and like a lot of the—like a number of the issues that the Court has addressed under the Establishment Clause, it has drawn some fairly fine lines. The first case involving a display of this nature was the Pawtucket, Rhode Island, display that was involved in Lynch v. Donnelly, and it was a display that was similar to the display in Jersey City. It included both religious and secular symbols. And they found that that was not a violation. Senator BROWNBACK. I want to jump in here because I have got several ways I want to. When I read your opinions, what I hear you to write is you would rather have a robust public square than a naked public square, that you think there is room for these sorts of displays in the public square. Judge ALITO. Well, that was exactly what Jersey City had decided in that case, and Jersey City said: We are one of the most religiously diverse, ethnically diverse, racially diverse communities you will find anywhere in the country. This is right across the New York harbor from the Statue of Liberty and from Ellis Island, and it is still an entry point for a lot of people coming into the country.

And so they had—over the course of the year, at the appropriate time, they had a Christmas display, they had a display of a menorah—on that particular year, Hanukkah was early in the month of December, so the display, the menorah was up at a different point. They had a display—they had celebrations for Muslim festivals, for Hindu festivals, for Buddhist festivals, for Latino festivals, for festivals concerning the many ethnic groups in the community. And their view was that this is the way we should show that all of these groups are valuable parts of our community and express our embracing of them. And this display, they said, reflected that philosophy and applying the precedents that the Supreme Court had provided in this area, the Pawtucket case and a later case involving a display in Pittsburgh, Judge Rendell and I, who were the judges in the majority on that case, said this is constitutional, this is consistent with the Establishment Clause.
Senator BROWNBACK. Well, and that is what—as we have had this 40 years of cases, I really hope we can have a public square that celebrates and not that it has got to be completely naked to views, and I appreciate that.
You wrote in a free exercise case, C.H. v. Olivia, a case in which a child sued through his parents for violation of his free speech and free exercise rights, when his school removed and repositioned a poster he had made of a religious figure that was important to him. It was a picture of Jesus. The poster was part of an assignment which students were instructed to show something for which they were thankful. The district court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the defendant, the school district. The Third Circuit affirmed. You dissented in that opinion. Can you elaborate on your reasoning in that particular opinion? Do you remember the case?
Judge ALITO. Yes, Senator, I do. Justice O’Connor pointed out something that’s very critical in this area. She said there is a big difference between Government speech endorsing religion and private religious speech, and this case—and private religious speech can’t be discriminated against. It has to be treated equally with secular speech. And in this case, this involved a student who—and there were two incidents. One involved reading. The students in the class were told that if they could read at a certain level, they would have—their reward would be to be able to read their favorite story to the class. And this student satisfied those requirements, and the student wanted to read a very simplified version of the story of Jacob and Esau to the class. And the teacher said, ‘‘No, you can’t read that to the class. You can read that privately to me off in a corner.’’
And then Thanksgiving was coming along, and the students were told, ‘‘Draw a picture of something that you’re thankful for,’’ and I guess the teacher expected they were going to draw pictures of football games and turkeys and things like that. But this student drew a picture of Jesus and said, ‘‘That’s what I’m thankful for.’’ And the teacher put all the other pictures up in the hall, but would not put this student’s picture up in the hall because of its religious content.
And that, we found, was a violation of this principle that you have to treat religious speech equally with secular speech. If you ask a student to say something about a topic, what are you thank-

ful for, and the student says something that fits within the topic that the student was asked to talk about, then you can’t discriminate against one kind of speech or another.
Senator BROWNBACK. I thought it was a very interesting stance, and I think appropriate, that you took, and I wanted to—obviously very active areas of the law that we have.
I want to look at the issue of checks and balances on the Federal court. It is a very active area here in Congress as a lot of people across the country and certainly Members of Congress have grown the feeling that we can rule however—we can do whatever we want to here, but wait until the Court decides, that it is the Court that have moved beyond judicial restraint. I asked this of John Roberts, and I asked what is—the checks and balances on Congress are obvious, the President can veto a bill, a court can declare something unconstitutional, checks and balances executive branch are clear, they can be challenged, their actions, in the court, the court can say the President can’t do that, we cannot appropriate the money from here. We have got checks and balances, and people are well known. Any high school government student would know that.
Checks and balances on the Court. When I talked with John Roberts about this, he said basically the only check and balance is judicial restraint. It is what the Court restrains itself in. And yet you have within the Constitution a provision that is there that I asked him about that I want to ask you about. Article III, Section 2 goes, ‘‘In all cases’’—excuse me. ‘‘In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact,’’ and then it goes on with this interesting Exceptions Clause, ‘‘with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.’’ The last phrase known as the Exceptions Clause.
What do you believe is Congress’s power to define the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under the Exceptions Clause?
Judge ALITO. Well, the Exceptions Clause obviously gives Congress the authority to define the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and it can provide for various avenues by which cases get to the Supreme Court, and that has changed over the years.
There’s been a controversy, never resolved, about the exact scope of the authority. It came up in Ex Parte McCardle in the post-Civil War era, and it has been raised by—it has been discussed by scholars in subsequent years, and there are several schools of thought in the question about whether it would be consistent with the Constitution for Congress to eliminate jurisdiction in the Supreme Court over a particular type of case, that’s an unresolved issue that the scholars have addressed, and some argue that that falls within the Exceptions Clause, and some argue that it would be inconsistent with other provisions of the Constitution.
Senator BROWNBACK. What I see taking place in this country, as the Court gets more and more involved in tough political issues, is you are going to be pressing other bodies then to say, ‘‘Look, we believe these decisions should be here. We believe the issues on the competing interests of an abortion, the mother and the child, should be decided by legislative bodies,’’ but the Court said no. Issue of marriage is coming through the court system right now. As the Court keeps getting involved in these areas, I think you are

going to see these sorts of constitutional issues being explored more and more.
Marriage case I want the take you to because that is making its way through the Federal Court. Forty-five of our 50 States have deemed marriage being between the union of a man and a woman. The State of Nebraska passes a State constitutional amendment, 70 percent of the people voting for it, saying that marriage is the union of a man and a woman. Yet a Federal judge in that case threw out the State constitutional amendment on novel constitutional grounds, and it is now making its way up through the system. The Congress has passed the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, passed overwhelmingly, signed into law by President Clinton, basically did two things. First establishes for purposes of Federal law marriage would be defined as the union of a man and a woman, and second, it would provide that no State would be forced to recognize a marriage entered into in another State. A number of legal scholars believe that this second part violates the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.
Judge Alito, this case is coming forward, and will probably be resolved in the Federal courts if it is not resolved by the Congress through constitutional amendment. What is your understanding of the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, and does this apply to the institution of marriage which has been traditionally an issue and an area left up to the States?
Judge ALITO. Well, several constitutional doctrines seem to be implicated by the matters that you discussed. The Full Faith and Credit Clause in general means that one State must honor judgments that are issued by a court of another State, and it’s an important part of the process. It is an important part of the Federal system, so that we don’t have worrying decisions in different States. It is not my—I have not had cases involving this, but there are—the doctrine has a certain, has certain boundaries to it. There are exceptions, and it covers certain areas and doesn’t cover other areas, and a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act under the Full Faith and Credit Clause would call into question the precise scope of the doctrine.
And I believe that scholars have expressed differing views about how it would apply in that situation, and that’s an issue that may well come up within the Federal courts, almost certain to do so.
Senator BROWNBACK. Yes. And I know you cannot express on it. One last thing I would like to get into just very briefly is the Takings Clause in the Kelo case that was in a neighboring circuit to yours, Kelo v. City of New London, where private property was taken by a private—another private group—private property was taken by a public group and given to another private group. Judge O’Connor wrote eloquently in her dissent, ‘‘Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with the Ritz Carlton, or any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory now.’’
I just conclude by putting that in front of you, saying that this is one that people have relied upon for a long time, that you could not take private property to another private individual for public use, and I hope that is one that the Court will end up reviewing at some point in time.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Brownback. Senator Coburn? Senator COBURN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, long day. I would like to put a few things into the record if I may. One is just a list of cases where Judge Alito ruled for the little guy. There has been a lot made, and here is a list of nine cases with specifics where he in fact—one of these I think he mentioned, but not the others. And I would like unanimous consent to— Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Senator COBURN. Actually, there are 15 cases. I also want to go back and quote from somebody who was a member of CAP, and this is a Judge Napolitano. He is a commentator on one of the news shows. I would like his statements put into the record from yesterday, where he clarified what CAP was about, and clarified the interest of ROTC at Princeton, and the fact that that was one of the leading reasons that that organization was formed, so I would like for those to be admitted as well. As you know, I am not an attorney. Sometimes it is very disadvantageous on this panel, but at times it is advantageous. I have this little thing that I have to depend on, and I kind of read it for what it says. As you talk about stare decisis—is that mentioned anywhere in here? Judge ALITO. It is not expressly mentioned in the Constitution. Senator COBURN. It is actually a procedure of common English law, correct? Judge ALITO. That’s its origin, yes. Senator COBURN. That is its origin, and we use that as a tool for working with the Constitution. Can you recall the number of times that precedents have been reversed by the Supreme Court? Judge ALITO. I don’t know the exact figure, Senator. Senator COBURN. I think it is around 170 some times, affecting some 225 cases, I believe. That is close. That may not be exactly accurate. So, in fact, it is a tool used to help us with the law, but our Founders did not say you have to use stare decisis in this, did they? Judge ALITO. No, they didn’t. They conferred the judicial power on the judiciary, and I think that contemplated that the Federal judiciary would be permitted to proceed with—in accordance with fundamental judicial procedures as they had been known— Senator COBURN. At the time. Judge ALITO. At the time. Senator COBURN. And Article III, section 2 really delineates the scope for the courts in this country, and what it says is, ‘‘All cases in law and equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States and treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority.’’ So that really gives us the scope under Article III, section 2. I was interested when Senator Kyl asked you yesterday about foreign law. That is something extremely disturbing to a lot of Americans, that many on the Supreme Court today will reference or pick and choose the foreign law that they want to use to help them make a decision to interpret our Constitution, where in fact, the oath of office mentions no foreign law. Matter of fact it

says the obligation is to use the United States law, the Constitution and the treaties, and that is exactly what Article III, section 2 says. So there is no reference at all to foreign law in terms of your obligations or your responsibility, and matter of fact, the absence of it would say that maybe this ought to be what we use, and the codified law of the Congress and the treaties rather than foreign law.
The question I have for you—and I could not get Judge Roberts to answer it because of the conflict that might occur afterwards, but I have the feeling that the vast majority of Americans do not think it is proper for the Supreme Court to use foreign law. I personally believe that that is an indication of not good behavior by a Justice, whether it be a Justice at a appellate division, or a magistrate, or a Supreme Court Justice. I just wondered if you had any comments on that comment.
Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t think that we should look to foreign law to interpret our own Constitution. I agree with you that the laws of the United States consist of the Constitution and treaties and laws, and I would add regulations that are promulgated in accordance with law. And I don’t think that it’s appropriate or useful to look to foreign law in interpreting the provisions of our Constitution. I think the Framers would be stunned by the idea that the Bill of Rights is to be interpreted by taking a poll of the countries of the world. The purpose of the Bill of Rights was to give Americans rights that were recognized practically nowhere else in the world at the time. The Framers did not want Americans to have the rights of people in France or the rights of people in Russia, or any of the other countries on the continent of Europe at the time. They wanted them to have the rights of Americans, and I think we should interpret our Constitution—we should interpret our Constitution. I don’t think it’s appropriate to look to foreign law.
I also don’t think that it’s—I think that it presents a host of practical problems that have been pointed out. You have to decide which countries you are going to survey, and then it is often difficult to understand exactly what you are to make of foreign court decisions. All countries don’t set up their court systems the same way. Foreign courts may have greater authority than the courts of the United States. They may be given a policymaking role, and therefore, it would be more appropriate for them to weigh in on policy issues. When our Constitution was being debated, there was a serious proposal to have members of the judiciary sit on a council of revision, where they would have a policymaking role before legislation was passed, and other countries can set up their judiciary in that way. So you’d have to understand the jurisdiction and the authority of the foreign courts.
And then sometimes it’s misleading to look to just one narrow provision of foreign law without considering the larger body of law in which it’s located. That can be—if you focus too narrowly on that, you may distort the big picture, so for those reasons, I just don’t think that’s a useful thing to do.
Senator COBURN. It actually undermines democracy because you get a pick and choose, and the people of this country do not get a pick and choose that law, as people from a different country. So it actually is a violation of the Constitution, and to me, I very strong-

ly and adamantly feel that it violates the good behavior, which is mentioned as part of the qualifications and the maintenance of that position.
I am sorry Senator Durbin left. I wanted to razz him a little bit. You have taken quite a bit of criticism on what things that you have written and said in 1985, but I want to put forward, for 45 years Senator Durbin was adamantly pro-life, and he wrote multiple, multiple letters expressing that up until 1989. He is a very strong advocate for the abortion stance and a free right to choose, but I think it is important that the American people—if he has the ability to change his mind on something, something he wrote in 1989, certainly you have the ability to say something was ineptly put. This is just Senator Durbin, I am teasing him a little bit, but I think it is important that people recognize people can change their mind. I continue to believe the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe v. Wade should be reversed. There are other Members that are adamantly pro-abortion, pro the destruction of human life today that have changed their mind, changed their position. So it is hard to be critical of you and on something you had written in 1985, when many of us have backtracked on things that we have said through the years. So I think it puts a little bit of perspective into where we are going.
I want to spend just a minute, if I can, yesterday during Senator Feinstein’s questioning there was some discussion about the Health Exception to any regulations pertaining to abortion. And on January 22nd, when Roe was decided, the Court also decided Doe v. Bolton, and in that case the Court ruled that a woman’s right to abortion cannot be limited by the State if abortion was sought for reasons of maternal health. As a practicing physician, I agree with that. I have actually performed abortions on women who were going to die if they did not have an abortion, so the choice was somebody alive versus losing both.
The Court defined health as all factors, physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and a woman’s age relevant to the well-being of the patient. This exception effectively expanded the right to abortion for any reason through all the entire pregnancy. Since that time, States have been trying to find ways to effectively regulate abortion without intruding on this health exception, but it has proven nearly impossible. The absence of knowledge is something that Roe v. Wade, which I believe was wrongly decided, has hurt us immensely in this country, and the absence of informed consent on abortion has hurt us immensely.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to enter into the record a study published, a 35-year longitudinal study, which was just released this January from New Zealand, that followed women, 600 women for 35 years from the time of the abortion, that studied the ill health effects of—
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.
Senator COBURN. I would also like to enter into the record a Breast Cancer Institute study and analysis of a Lancet 3/25/04 article, and also the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Shadigian, University of Michigan, Clinical Associate Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, as to the complications.

Chairman SPECTER. All of those documents, without objection, will be made a part of the record.
Senator COBURN. It is amazing what we do not know, and as I explained in my opening statement, once we go down a path, the complications associated—the rulings that you make have major impact. I understand the questions that you cannot answer on things that are going to come before us, and I cannot pretend to know what is in your heart about those issues. But what I do know is you were pretty aggressively approached on positions in terms of Justice O’Connor and Executive power. There seemed to be a blinding contradiction during some of your questions that were presented by my colleagues yesterday that raised concerns that you are too close to the Executive and too supportive of Executive power. They wanted to be sure that you respect the role of the judiciary and are free from the influences of the political branches. However, they then argue that you should have the same ideology of Justice O’Connor to maintain the balance on the Court. I have trouble figuring out how they can have it both ways. That is an inherently political desire.
Is there anything in the Constitution, this little document, that says what the ideology ought to be of one Supreme Court Justice replacing another one?
Judge ALITO. The Supreme Court simply gives the President the authority to nominate Justices of the Supreme Court and other Federal judges, and gives Congress the advice and consent responsibility, and doesn’t go further than that.
Senator COBURN. And the President, by being elected, the only person in this country who is elected by the whole country, is given that honor and that privilege as well as that responsibility, and then we have the responsibility to advise and consent to that; is that correct?
Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator COBURN. But nowhere in the Constitution, nor by precedent—matter of fact, the precedents are just exactly the opposite of that—is it stated that somebody has to have the same philosophy as somebody that is coming off the Court. Judge ALITO. I think that every Supreme Court Justice is an individual, and I think every nominee is an individual, and no nominee can ever be a duplicate of someone who retires, and particularly when someone retires after such a distinguished career and such a historic career as Justice O’Connor. Nobody can be expected as a nominee to fit that mold. Senator COBURN. So the fact that you have to fit the Sandra Day O’Connor mold is really a misapplication of—there is no precedent that would say that. Judge ALITO. The only—if I’m confirmed, I’ll be myself. I’ll be the same person that I was on the Court of Appeals. That’s the only thing that I can say in answer to that. Senator COBURN. Let me repeat some facts that one of my colleagues mentioned yesterday. Of the 109 Justices to sit on the Supreme Court, nearly half have replaced Justices appointed by another political party. President Clinton replaced Justice White, who dissented on Roe v. Wade, with Justice Ginsburg, who argued for a right to abortion. Justice Ginsburg was, I think, three votes

against her in the Senate when she was approached, and she took it completely opposite, but she was well qualified. She had integrity, and she was voted onto the Court even though many people knew that her philosophy was very different from theirs; is that true?
Judge ALITO. She was—the vote was 90 something to a small number. I know that, yes.
Senator COBURN. A lot of times in these hearings, you do not get a chance to say, why would you want to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States? Why would you want that responsibility? Why do you want to go through this process to be able to achieve that position? Can you tell the American people why?
Judge ALITO. I think it’s a chance to make a contribution. I think it’s a chance to use whatever talent I have in the most productive way that I can think of. There are a lot of things that I can’t do and a lot of things that I couldn’t do very well if I was given the assignment of doing them, but I’ve spent most of my career as an appellate attorney. Well, I spent most of my career before becoming a judge as an appellate attorney and now I’ve spent 15 years as an appellate judge and I think this is what I do best. I think this gives me an opportunity to make a contribution to the country and to the society, because the Supreme Court has a very important role to play and it’s important that it do the things that it’s supposed to do well and I would do my very best to further that.
And it is also important for the Supreme Court, and for that matter, all of the Federal courts, to exercise restraint. As you were referring to earlier, that has turned out to be the principal check on the way the judiciary does its work on a day-to-day basis. The judiciary is not checked in its day-to-day work in the same way as the Congress and the President. The Congress can pass a law or pass a bill and the President can veto it. One House can pass a bill, the other House may not go along. The President has to propose legislation to Congress if the President wants legislation. Congress can pass laws that the President doesn’t like. There are checks and balances that are worked out in the ordinary processes of government.
But when it comes to the judiciary in deciding constitutional cases, the judiciary is checked on a daily basis primarily by its own discipline, its own self-restraint. And so it’s important for—the judiciary has these twin responsibilities that are in intention at times, doing what it is supposed to do and doing those things well and vigorously and courageously, if it comes to that, but at the same time, constantly monitoring its own activities and asking, are we doing what we are supposed to be doing as judges? Are we functioning as judges, or are we stepping over the line? Are we turning ourselves into legislators? Are we turning ourselves into members of the executive branch or administrators? And the judiciary has to maintain its independence. That’s of critical importance, and that’s an important part of the role and that also has to be informed by this sense of self-restraint.
Senator COBURN. Thank you. During Judge Roberts’s hearing, Senator Feinstein tried to get him to talk and speak out of his heart and I thought it was a great question so that the American people can see your heart. This booklet is designed to protect the

weak, to give equality to those who might not be able to do it themselves, to protect the frail, to make sure that there is equal justice under the law. You know, I think at times during these hearings you have been unfairly criticized or characterized as that you don’t care about the less fortunate. You don’t care about the little guy. You don’t care about the weak or the innocent. Can you comment just about Sam Alito and what he cares about and let us see a little bit of your heart and what is important to you and why?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I tried to—in my opening statement, I tried to provide a little picture of who I am as a human being and how my background and my experiences have shaped me and brought me to this point. I don’t come from an affluent background or a privileged background. My parents were both quite poor when they were growing up. I know about their experiences, and I didn’t experience those things. I don’t take credit for anything that they did or anything that they overcame, but I think that children learn a lot from their parents and they learn from what the parents say, but I think they learn a lot more from what the parents do and from what they take from the stories of their parents’ lives.
And that’s why I went into that in my opening statement, because when a case comes before me involving, let’s say, someone who is an immigrant, and we get an awful lot of immigration cases and naturalization cases, I can’t help but think of my own ancestors because it wasn’t that long ago when they were in that position. And so it’s my job to apply the law. It’s not my job to change the law or to bend the law to achieve any results, but I have to, when I look at those cases, I have to say to myself, and I do say to myself, this could be your grandfather. This could be your grandmother. They were not citizens at one time and they were people who came to this country.
When I have cases involving children, I can’t help but think of my own children and think about my children being treated in the way the children may be treated in the case that’s before me. And that goes down the line. When I get a case about discrimination, I have to think about people in my own family who suffered discrimination because of their ethnic background or because of religion or because of gender, and I do take that into account. When I have a case involving someone who’s been subjected to discrimination because of disability, I have to think of people who I’ve known and admired very greatly who had disabilities and I’ve watched them struggle to overcome the barriers that society puts up, often just because it doesn’t think of what it’s doing, the barriers that it puts up to them.
So those are some of the experiences that have shaped me as a person.
Senator COBURN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I think I will yield back the balance of my time at this time and if I have additional questions, I will get them in the next round.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. We will now proceed to the second round of questioning, with each Senator having 20 minutes, and we will take 20 minutes more and then we will take a break. Is it appropriate for the Court to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional because of our, quote, ‘‘method of reasoning’’? Does the

Court have some superior insights on a method of reasoning? Is it appropriate for the Court to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional, functioning as a taskmaster to make sure that Congress does its homework? There have been a series of decisions which have seriously undercut congressional power where, in my opinion, the Court has usurped the authority of Congress, and this moves into the often-criticized range of congressional legislation—judicial legislation and derogation of the congressional power.
We are seeking, Judge Alito, to have an appropriate equilibrium in our system and the beauty of the American system is that no one has too much power. We call it separation of power. Although not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, we call it checks and balances. We have looked into the issue of tremendous importance. Regrettably, we haven’t plumbed it, only scratched the surface, but our time is limited on the authority of the President under War Powers Article II contrasted with Congress’s authority to legislate for privacy under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and I want to move into two other analogous areas, Congress versus the Court and the Court versus Congress, as Congress has taken away the jurisdiction of the Court, notably very recently by stripping habeas corpus jurisdiction on detainees.
When the Congress legislated to protect women against violence, the Congress did so with a very expansive record. It wasn’t like Lopez, which was a revolution where the Court upset 60 years of congressional power under the Commerce Act, but in the case of U.S. v. Morrison involving the legislation to protect women against violence, there was a record which included gender bias from task forces in 21 States, five separate reports. Notwithstanding a, quote, ‘‘mountain of evidence,’’ as noted by four dissenters, the Court declared the Act unconstitutional because of our method of reasoning.
Now, you are a judge. You may be a Supreme Court Justice. Is there something we are missing? Do you judges have some method of reasoning which is superior to the method of reasoning of the Congress?
Judge ALITO. I think the branches of government are equal and everybody, all the officers in all the branches of government take an oath to the same Constitution—
Chairman SPECTER. Equality on method of reasoning? Judge ALITO. I would never suggest that judges have superior reasoning power than does Congress. I think what the Court was getting at when it made that statement in Morrison, and yesterday, I looked at something that I had written and said that was not well phrased, I think that what the Court was getting at there in Morrison was that it was applying a certain standard, a certain legal standard as to whether something substantially affected commerce, and I think that is what they were getting at, but— Chairman SPECTER. It is hard to figure out what they were getting at. We do know what they said. They said our method of reasoning was defective. But I take it from your statement you wouldn’t subscribe to overturning congressional Acts because of our method of reasoning? Judge ALITO. I think that Congress’s ability to reason is fully equal to that of the judiciary and I think Congress—

Chairman SPECTER. And you think that even after appearing here for a day and a half?
[Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I have always thought that and nothing has changed my mind about that. Senator HATCH. I am starting to worry about you. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. That is on Senator Hatch’s time. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Let me take up the Americans with Disabilities Act on two decisions within a couple of years of each other, one where the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the Americans with Disabilities Act because it applied to employment, upholding the Act as it applied to access to facilities. Justice Scalia had a ringing dissent when the Court imposed the standard of congruence and proportionality, a very difficult standard which you wrestled with in the family leave case. The congruent and proportional standard came to the Court in the Boerne case in 1997, so it is very recent origin and it has all the earmarks of having been pulled out of the thin air. Justice Scalia said that it was a thinly veiled invitation to judicial arbitrariness and policy-driven decisionmaking. Justice Scalia criticized the majority opinion for functioning as a taskmaster to see to it that Congress had done its homework. Here again, there was a voluminous record, 13 congressional hearings. Thirty-thousand people were surveyed. Do you think, Judge Alito, that a test like congruence and proportionality is fair notice to the Congress on what we can do by way of legislation? Here, we are dealing—and it is maybe worth just a little explanation. When Congress legislates on constitutional issues under Article V of the 14th Amendment, the Court then makes a comparison to State immunity under the 11th Amendment. But do you think that is a fair test as to what we are to try to figure out what the Supreme Court is later going to say is congruent and proportionate? Judge ALITO. Well, like many tests in the law, it is not a mathematical or a scientific formula that can produce a particular result with certainty as it is applied to particular situations. It addresses— Chairman SPECTER. How about just fair notice? Never mind mathematical certainty. Judge ALITO. It addresses a difficult problem the Court has grappled with over the years and that is the scope of Congress’s authority under Section V of the 15th Amendment—of the 14th Amendment to pass legislation enforcing the provisions of the 14th Amendment, and one argument that has been made which would represent a very narrow interpretation of congressional power, and this is basically the argument that Justice Scalia—the position that Justice Scalia took in the dissent that you mentioned, is that Congress’ authority doesn’t extend any further than remedying actual violations of the 14th Amendment, that there is no—Congress doesn’t have additional authority to enact prophylactic measures outside of the area of race, which Justice Scalia would treat dif-

ferently and recognize broader authority because of the historical origin of the 14th Amendment.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, what is wrong with the test of Maryland v. Wirtz and Gonzales v. Raich, because you take a look at power under the Commerce Clause and to be applicable to our legislation under the Americans with Disabilities Act? That test is where the Court has gone into some length to say what you have gone into repeatedly, that judges have no expertise. It is up to the Congress to have hearings. It is up to the Congress to find facts. It is up to the Congress to find out what goes on in the real world.
In Wirtz in 1968 and reaffirmed recently in Gonzales v. Raich after Morrison, after Lopez, quote, ‘‘where we find the legislators have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary for the protection of commerce,’’ could apply as well to disability, ‘‘our investigation is at an end.’’ What is wrong with that? Would you subscribe to that test over the proportionate and congruence test?
Judge ALITO. There are a number of tests that have been used and proposed over the years in this area and this is the subject, I think, of continuing litigation in the Supreme Court. There is the Maryland v. Wirtz approach and then the City of Boerne approach, and you mentioned that the City of Boerne is a relatively recent decision and it’s been followed by a number of subsequent decisions—
Chairman SPECTER. Where did it come from? Where did the Boerne test on proportionate and congruence come from if not thin air?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think it was an effort by the majority in that case to identify a standard that would not strictly limit congressional power to remedying established violations of the 14th Amendment without going—while still, in their view, retaining the necessary remedial connection to Section V of the 14th Amendment. It is an approach that they have used in a number of cases and the cases have not come out—sometimes the results in the cases have not been predictable.
You mentioned the contrast between the two decisions under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I think Nevada v. Hibbs was a decision that some people—that surprised some people based on the Court’s prior precedents. So there is, I think, still some ferment in this area and I am sure it is a question that’s going to be—that will come up in future cases.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, we are speaking not only to you, Judge Alito, but to the Court. The Court watches these proceedings and I think they ought to know what the Congress thinks about making us schoolchildren per challenging our method of reasoning. We are considering legislation which would give Congress standing to go into the Supreme Court to uphold our cases. Right now, the Solicitor General does that, but he is in the executive branch. We don’t want to derogate the Solicitor General in your presence, Judge Alito, but the thinking that we have had was to speak about the decisions, the Court’s decisions on the floor in the Senate, nobody pays attention to that. Maybe we would try to come in as amicus. Why do that? We have the power to grant standing. We can grant standing to ourselves and come into Court and fight to uphold constitutionality.

Let me move at this point to the recent legislation which takes away the jurisdiction of the Federal bench to hear habeas corpus decisions. It is in the context of the detainees.
Justice O’Connor in Hamdi laid out the law in flat terms. All agree that absent suspension, the Writ of Habeas Corpus remains available to every individual detained within the United States, every individual, not just citizens. And then she spells out the way you suspend the writ, and you do it only by rebellion or invasion. Then this recent legislation says the District Columbia Court of Appeals shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision by the Combatant Status Review Tribunal. If it means what it says, and judges like to look to the statute as opposed to going to congressional intent, if it means what it says, that there is exclusive jurisdiction, there is no jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
This may come before the Court, but what factors would you consider to be relevant in making the analysis as to again maintaining equilibrium between the Court and the Congress of our authority to take away Federal court jurisdiction on this important item?
Judge ALITO. In the area of habeas corpus, there are a number of important principles that have to be considered in reviewing any legislation that is argued to—that someone contends has altered habeas jurisdiction. The first is that the Court said in a case called INS v. Cyr that if there is an attempt to—that habeas jurisdiction can’t be taken away unless it’s clear in the statute that that’s what was intended. Habeas jurisdiction is not to be repealed by implication. That’s one important principle.
And then in Felker v. Turpin, which involved the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, Congress—I’m sorry, the Supreme Court considered arguments about whether provisions of that legislation which restructured Federal habeas review violated the Constitution and they found that there wasn’t a violation because the essentials of the writ were preserved. And so if other legislation is challenged, it would have to be reviewed under standards like that.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, I want to move now to a subject on efforts to have television in the Supreme Court of the United States, a subject very near and dear to my heart. I have been pushing it for a long time. I am personally convinced that it is going to come some day. I am not sure whether it will come during my tenure in the Senate, more likely to come during the tenure of Chief Justice Roberts in the Supreme Court, or your tenure, if confirmed.
The Supreme Court said in the Richmond Television case that, quote, ‘‘the rights of a public trial belong not just to the accused, but to the public and the press, as well. Such openness has long been recognized as an indispensable attribute in the Anglo-Saxon trial.’’ There are many other lines of authority, but only a few moments left to set the stage here, but the Supreme Court has the final word.
We can talk about the President’s war power under Article II and the congressional authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, but the Court makes the decision. We can talk about taking away habeas corpus jurisdiction, but the Court decides

whether we can do it or not. We can talk about the insult of declaring Acts of Congress unconstitutional because of our method of reasoning, but the Court can do that. And the Court has made these decisions on all the important subjects. The Court decided who would be President of the United States in Bush v. Gore. The Court decides who lives on a woman’s right to choose, who dies on the right to die, on the death penalty, on every critical decision.
The Congress has the authority to do many things on the administrative level, such as we set the starting date for the Court, the first Monday in October. We set what is a quorum for the Court, six members. Congress sets the size of the Court, the effort made by President Roosevelt to increase the number from nine to 15. We put provisions in on speedy trial, time limits on habeas corpus matters.
In recent times, some of those who have objected to televising the Court have been on television quite a bit themselves. When Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer come on TV, it is a pretty good show. There is not much surfing when that happens, like surfing when my turn comes to question.
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. But this proceeding on confirmation of Supreme Court Justices has attracted a lot of attention. As I said to you yesterday, I am tired of picking up the front page everywhere and seeing your picture on it. Fred Hume was on Fox News talking about going to a Redskins game in 1991 when Justice Thomas was being confirmed and how he had his earsets on to listen to the proceedings. I think Senator Leahy was questioning Professor Hill at that particular time. But how about it? Why shouldn’t the Supreme Court be open to the public with television? Judge ALITO. Well, I had the opportunity to deal with this issue actually in relation to my own court a number of years ago. All the courts of appeals were given the authority to allow their oral arguments to be televised if they wanted and we had a debate within our court about whether we would, or whether we should allow television cameras in our courtroom and I argued that we should do it. I thought that it would be a useful— Chairman SPECTER. You have taken a position on this issue? Judge ALITO. Well, I did, and this is one of the matters on which I ended up in dissent in my court. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I think the majority was fearful that our Nielsen numbers would be in the negatives. Chairman SPECTER. Could you promise the same result? [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Could you promise the same result, if confirmed, to be a dissenter for the Court to allow TV? Senator GRASSLEY. Be careful how you answer. Chairman SPECTER. Be careful how you answer everything, as you have been. Judge ALITO. The issue is a little bit different on the Supreme Court and it would be presumptuous for me to talk about it right now, particularly since I think at least one of the Justices has said that a television camera would make its way into the Supreme

Court courtroom over his dead body, so I wouldn’t want to comment on it.
Chairman SPECTER. Justice Souter. But quite a few of his colleagues have been on television.
Let me ask you this, Judge Alito. I know what the answer will be, with 7 seconds left. Will you keep an open mind?
Judge ALITO. I will keep an open mind despite the position I took on the Third Circuit.
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Judge Alito. We will now take a 15-minute break and we will reconvene at 11:35. [Recess 11:18 a.m. to 11:35 a.m.] Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume. Turning to the distinguished ranking member, Senator Leahy, for 20 minutes. Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, welcome back. If the past is any prologue, you probably do not have more than another day or so of this to go through. I am concerned. I want to just state this right out, concerned that you may be retreating from part of your record. I think that some of the answers that—I have expressed this concern, mentioned to the Chairman I am concerned that some of your answers were inconsistent with past statements. All of us want to know your legal and constitutional philosophy. So let’s go back to the questions that I was asking yesterday about checking Presidential power, and we spoke about Justice Jackson’s opinion in Youngstown. Justice Jackson, as you know, is a hero of mine, and I point often to the Youngstown case. But when Congress acts to strain the President’s power, as we did with the anti-torture statutes and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I believe the President’s power then is at its lowest ebb. You seemed to be saying yesterday that fell into the second category of Jackson, the twilight zone. Actually, I believe you were mistaken on that. Justice Jackson spoke of the twilight zone area, or as he said, zone of twilight, where Congress had not acted. So let us go to the landmark decision in Hamdi, and Justice O’Connor’s decision. The issue there was whether due process required that a U.S. citizen, should have a meaningful chance to challenge the factual basis for his detention by the Government. Now, Justice O’Connor wrote that the President does not have a blank check even in time of war. Yesterday you told Senator Specter that you agreed with Justice O’Connor’s general statement. A very different view was in the dissent. Justice Thomas would have upheld the extreme claims with the all powerful and essentially unchecked President. He argued the Government’s powers could not be balanced away by the Court, and there is no occasion to balance a competing interest. Which one is right, Justice O’Connor or Justice Thomas? They are quite a bit different. Judge ALITO. Justice O’Connor wrote the opinion of the Court. The first question that she addressed in Hamdi was whether it was lawful to detain Hamdi, and it was a statutory question, and it was a question whether—it was whether he was being detained in violation of what is often referred to as the anti-detention statute, which was passed to prevent a repetition of the Japanese intern-

ment that occurred during World War II, and she concluded that the authorization for the use of military force constituted authorization for detention. And then she went on to the issue of the constitutional procedures that would have to be followed before someone could be detained, and she looked to standard procedural due process law in this area, and identified some of the requirements that would have to be followed before someone could be detained.
And now issues have arisen about the identity of the tribunal that is to make a determination about detaining people who are taken into custody during the war on terrorism, and that’s one of the issues that’s working its way through the court system.
Senator LEAHY. No, I am not talking about things working their way through, but just on Hamdi, which has already been decided. Would you say that Justice O’Connor basically applied the Jackson test, not the twilight zone test, but the test of where the President’s power is at its lowest ebb?
Judge ALITO. In addressing the statutory question I don’t think she had any need to get into Justice Jackson’s framework as well.
Senator LEAHY. Would you say it would be consistent with what Justice Jackson said?
Judge ALITO. I think it certainly is consistent with what Justice Jackson said.
Senator LEAHY. Which decision do you personally agree with, hers or the dissent by Justice Thomas?
Judge ALITO. I think that the war powers are divided between the executive branch and Congress. I think that’s a starting point to look at in this area. The President is the Commander in Chief, and he has authority in the area of foreign affairs, and is recognized in Supreme Court decisions as the sole organ of the country in conducting foreign affairs.
Senator LEAHY. But you are not going to say which of the two decisions you agree with.
Judge ALITO. Well, I’m trying to explain my understanding of the division of authority in this area, and I think that it’s divided between the executive and the Congress. I certainly don’t think that the President has a blank check in time of war. He does have the responsibility as the Commander in Chief, which is an awesome responsibility.
Senator LEAHY. And we all understand that and appreciate that. I understood, listening to Chief Justice Roberts, when he was here sitting where you are, that he felt that Justice O’Connor’s decision most clearly tracked the Jackson standards in Youngstown.
But I want to get more into this unitary Executive theory because I really had questions listening to you yesterday. You have said as recently as five years ago, that you believe the unitary Executive theory best captures the constitutional role of Presidential power. You were a sitting judge when you said that. And do you still adhere to that constitutional view that you were expressing 5 years ago?
Judge ALITO. I think that the considerations that inform the theory of the unitary Executive are still important in determining, in deciding separation of powers issues that arise in this area. Of course, when questions come up involving the power of removal, which was the particular power that I was talking about in the

talk that you’re referring to, those are now governed by a line of precedents from Myers going through Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener and Morrison, where the Court held 8–1 that the removal restrictions that were placed on an independent counsel under the Independent Counsel Act did not violate separation of powers principles. So those would be applied. Those would be the governing precedents on the question of removal, but my point in the talk was that the considerations that underlie this theory are relevant, should inform decisionmaking in the area going beyond the narrow question of removal.
Senator LEAHY. But in the past you criticized Morrison. Are you saying now that you are comfortable with Morrison, that you accept it?
Judge ALITO. Morrison is a settled—is a precedent of the Court. It was an 8–1 decision. It’s entitled to respect under stare decisis. It concerns the Independent Counsel Act, which no longer is in force.
Senator LEAHY. So do you hold today that the Independent Counsel statute was beyond the congressional authority to authorize— to enact?
Judge ALITO. No. I don’t think that was ever my position. Senator LEAHY. All right. Under the theory of unitary Executive that you have espoused, what weight and relevance should the Supreme Court give to a Presidential signing statement? I ask that because these are real issues. I mean we passed the McCain-Warner, et al. statute against torture, when the President did a separate signing statement. After he signed it into law, he did not veto it. He had the right and, of course, the ability to veto it. He did not veto it. He signed it into law, and then he wrote a sidebar, a signing statement basically saying that it will not apply to him or those acting under his order if he does not want it to. Under the unitary Executive theory, one could argue that he has an absolute right to ignore a law that Congress has written. What kind of weight do you think should be given to signing statements? Judge ALITO. I don’t see any connection between the concept of a unitary Executive and the weight that should be given to signing statements in interpreting statutes. I view those as entirely separate questions. The question of the unitary Executive, as I was explaining yesterday, does not concern the scope of Executive powers. It concerns who controls whatever power the Executive has. You could have an Executive with very narrow powers and still have a unitary Executive. So those are entirely different questions. The scope of Executive power gets into the question of inherent Executive power. Senator LEAHY. Let’s go into that a little bit because back in the days when I was a prosecutor, I mean I was very shocked what happened in the Saturday Night Massacre. A President orders certain things to be done. The Attorney General says, no, I won’t do it. Fires him. The Deputy Attorney General, said, ‘‘OK, you do it,’’ and Deputy Attorney General would not, saying it violated the law. Fires him. They keep on going down to finally find one person, a person you have praised, Robert Bork, who says, ‘‘Fine, I’ll fire him. I’ll do what the President says.’’

You have criticized Congress for allowing these independent agencies to refine and apply policies passed by Congress. You said that insofar as the President is the Chief Executive, he should follow their policies, not Congress.
So let’s take one, for example, the Federal Election Commission, independent agency. They make policies. Suppose the President, whoever was the President, did not like the fact they were investigating somebody who had contributed to him. Could he order them to stop that investigation?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I don’t think I have ever said that—I don’t think I’ve ever challenged the constitutionality of independent agencies. My understanding—
Senator LEAHY. No, but you have said—my understanding is that you chastised Congress for giving so much power to them when the power should be in the President or in the Executive.
Judge ALITO. Senator, I don’t think I’ve ever said that either. I said that I thought that there was merit to the theory of the unitary Executive, and I tried to explain how I thought that should play out in the post-Morrison world, accepting Morrison as the Supreme Court’s latest decision in a resounding 8–1 decision on the issue of removal. How should the issue of—how should the concept of the unitary Executive play out in the post-Morrison world?
On the issue of removal, my understanding of where the law stands now is that Myers established that there are certain officers of the executive branch whom the President has the authority to remove as he sees fit. There are—and there are those—
Senator LEAHY. Of course, he could fire his whole cabinet today if he wanted to. We all accept that.
Judge ALITO. Well, that was the issue that was presented by the Tenure in Office Act that led to the impeachment of the first President Johnson, and in Myers, Chief Justice Taft, although the Act of that controversy was long past, Chief Justice Taft opined that the Tenure in Office Act had been unconstitutional.
Senator LEAHY. But let us not go off the subject of these independent agencies that we have set up. Use as an example the FEC, the Federal Election Commission. Could the President, if he did not like somebody they were investigating, a contributor or something, could he order them to stop?
Judge ALITO. What Morrison says is that Congress can place restrictions on the removal of inferior officers, provided that those removal restrictions don’t interfere with the President’s exercise of Executive authority. So they adopted a functional approach, and that was the Court’s latest word on this question. They looked back to Humphrey’s Executor, and Wiener, which had talked about categories, and they—categories of quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative officers, and they reformulated this as a functional approach, and that’s the approach that would now be applied.
Senator LEAHY. Do you believe the President has the power to curtail investigations, for example, by the Department of Justice?
Judge ALITO. I don’t think— Senator LEAHY. The Department of Justice is under him. Judge ALITO. I don’t think the President is above the law, and the President is the head of the executive branch, and I’ve ex-

485
plained my understanding of the removal restrictions that can and cannot be placed on officers of the executive branch.
Senator LEAHY. But could he order them to stop an investigation?
Judge ALITO. Well, you’d have to look at the facts of the case and the particular officer that we’re talking about.
Senator LEAHY. Could he order the FBI to conduct surveillance in a way not authorized by statute?
Judge ALITO. The President is subject to constitutional restrictions, and he cannot lawfully direct the FBI or anybody in the Justice Department or anybody else in the executive branch to do anything that violates the Constitution.
Senator LEAHY. Could he—I am speaking now of statute—could he order our intelligence agencies to do something that was specifically prohibited by statute?
Judge ALITO. My answer to that is the same thing. He has to follow the Constitution and the laws of the United States. He has to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. If a statute is unconstitutional, then the President—then the Constitution would trump the statute. But if a statute is not unconstitutional then the statute is binding on the President and everyone else.
Senator LEAHY. Does the President have unlimited power just to declare a statute, especially if it is a statute that he had signed into law, to then declare it unconstitutional or say he is not going to follow it?
Judge ALITO. If the matter is later challenged in court, of course, the President isn’t going to have the last word on that question, that’s for sure. And the courts would exercise absolutely independent judgment on that question. It’s emphatically the duty of the courts to say what the law is when constitutional questions are raised in cases that come before the courts.
Senator LEAHY. That is an answer I agree with. Thank you. In other areas, SEC, can he order them to stop an investigation if it is somebody he does not want investigated?
Judge ALITO. Well, the independent agencies are governed by Humphrey’s Executor and cases that follow that, and there have been restrictions placed on the removal of commissioners of the independent agencies, and they have been sustained by the Supreme Court. That’s where the Supreme Court precedent on the issue stands.
Senator LEAHY. Is that settled law? Judge ALITO. It is a line of precedent that culminated, I would say—there have been a few additional cases relating to this, the Edmond case and the Freitag case, but I would look to Morrison, which was an 8–1 decision involving a subject of considerable public controversy, the removal of an independent counsel, removal of restrictions on that independent counsel. Senator LEAHY. I am still having some difficulty with statements you have made about the unitary Executive and how you would apply it. You said yesterday, in answer to a question I asked, that when people’s rights are violated, they should have their day in court. The courts are there to protect the rights of individuals. I do not think anybody in this room would disagree with that. It is the practice we look at in PIRG v. Magnesium Electron. You concluded

the Congress did not have the constitutional authority to authorize citizens to bring a suit against polluters under the Clean Water Act, whether the people had justiciable claims or not, there were a number of people downstream from Magnesium Electron. They said the water had been polluted. They brought a suit. You threw it out. Judge Lewis dissented, said it should have gone back to the lower court on the question of facts.
I will give you a two-part question. One, why did you send that case back to the lower court? And do you accept Laidlaw as being settled law?
Judge ALITO. Well, Magnesium Electron presented the question of whether we had a case or controversy under Article III, and that’s the fundamental limit on our jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has said that we do not have a case or controversy before us if we do not have a party that has constitutional standing which requires injury in fact. And the issue was whether the plaintiffs in that case had established injury in fact. There was a plant that was discharging certain things into a creek, which eventually emptied into the Delaware River, and the plaintiffs in the case alleged that they enjoyed the Delaware River in a variety of ways. They ate fish from the river. They drank water from the river. They walked along the river.
But there was no—there was nothing in the evidence—and Judge Lewis agreed on this. Judge Roth wrote the opinion and I agreed with Judge Roth, and Judge Lewis agreed with us on this point, there was nothing in the record.
Senator LEAHY. But didn’t Judge Lewis agree with you on the legal point, but he suggested sending it back to the lower court to determine whether there were facts to give standing? I mean, we all agree you can’t be in a case if you don’t have standing, but didn’t Judge Lewis say, send it back to the lower court so they can determine on the facts whether there might be standing?
Judge ALITO. The evidence that was before us did not show that there was any standing on the part of the plaintiffs. There was no evidence of harm to the Delaware River in any way from the discharges and that was the basis of Judge Roth’s opinion which with I agreed. As I recall, Judge Lewis’s point was that the case should go back to the district court so that the plaintiffs could have an opportunity to present additional evidence. But as I recall, they were not even arguing before us that they had additional evidence. They were not arguing before us, as I recall, that we have additional evidence and we’d like the opportunity to go back to the district court to present it. That’s my recollection of the matter.
Senator LEAHY. And the other part of my question is Laidlaw, is it settled law?
Judge ALITO. Well, Laidlaw is a precedent on the Supreme Court and my answer to the question there is the same. It’s entitled to the respect of stare decisis.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. Judge Alito, I just want to clarify a few matters. In his questioning this morning, Senator Durbin from Illinois I think apparently misstated what Chief Justice Roberts said during his confirmation hearing. Senator Durbin claimed that now the

487
Chief Justice said that Roe was the settled law of the land. In fact, that exchange that Senator Durbin referred to was made during the confirmation process for Judge Roberts to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, where he would have to admit that that would be settled law for him in that court. It is beyond question that for a circuit court nominee, the Supreme Court’s pronouncements on specific questions are binding precedents and will be the settled law of the land.
Moreover, contrary to the distinguished Senator from Illinois’s suggestion, then-Judge Roberts’s testimony in his recent confirmation hearing, and Judge, your testimony today and yesterday, you have both been entirely consistent in this particular matter. I just wanted to clarify that because there is a difference between a nominee for the circuit court of appeals saying that something is settled law that he or she has to be bound by than by somebody who is a nominee for the Supreme Court, and that is just a matter of clarification that I would like to make at this time.
Now, yesterday, you were asked, I think, some 340 questions by 15 Senators and you are getting a bunch today. I am told that you felt that you had to decline to answer only about 5 percent of them. That is even lower than previous Supreme Court nominees, by far in most cases. This hearing has hopefully provided an opportunity for you to address our concerns and answer some of the criticisms from members of this Committee. But, of course, there is always a battle waged outside of this Committee room by the special interest groups, who are also making charges and launching really unfair attacks on you. Now, these attacks typically go directly across the airwaves or the Internet with hardly a chance to even catch them, let alone address them or rebut them or correct them. So I want to give you a chance to respond to some of these attacks by some of these left-wing groups, many of which are certainly less than responsible and, in my view, pretty reprehensible in what they do in these matters.
One group says in a press release that in the Chittister case and at other times in your career on the bench, you go out of your way to rule against workers. This group claims what it calls your views and biases are strong evidence that you would, in their words, quote, ‘‘rarely rule in favor of those seeking justice in the courts.’’ I think that is a good example of how misleading some of these groups can actually be, where they are looking only for results in certain cases rather than upholding of the law itself in those particular cases. In that particular case, they are apparently willing to ignore two things about the cases they discuss. The ignore the facts, they ignore the law, and that is all, just the facts and the law. But they also ignore what you have written and they ignore what you have said here today.
How about that criticism, Judge? In Chittister, did you go out of your way to rule against workers? What were the facts and the law in the case and why did you think that they required the result that you finally upheld in that case?
Judge ALITO. I felt the result was dictated by Supreme Court precedent, and I wasn’t the only one who thought that. That was a unanimous decision of our panel. Judge McKee and, I believe, Judge Fulham from the District Court in Philadelphia were on that

panel. They all agreed, and it is my recollection that seven other courts of appeals have decided the case the same way. More than 20 court of appeals—that issue the same way. More than 20 court of appeals judges, including judges appointed by all recent Presidents, have reached that decision.
I think when you look at the law and the facts of the case, it becomes clear why there is so much unanimity on the question. Whether one likes the test or not, the test that we in the lower courts have to apply in this area is the congruence and proportionality test from City of Boerne, and therefore, what we had to do was to see whether there was a record of discrimination relating to the particular provision that was at issue in Chittister, which had to do with leave for personal illness. So there would have to be some evidence that State employers had given more leave for personal illness to men than women, or more leave for personal illness to women than men, and there was no evidence whatsoever on this issue. That’s why all of these courts of appeals reached the conclusion that they did in Chittister.
Senator HATCH. When somebody takes an unfair crack at me, I can come back at them as a Member of the U.S. Senate. But because you are a judge and not a politician, you really don’t have the opportunity, really, to address fully these misrepresentations of your views, and there have been plenty of them in this process that you have had to undergo. So I wanted to give you some opportunity here.
For example, one liberal group sent an e-mail around just yesterday that claimed you were not responsive to a question about whether the President can immunize executive branch officials who directly violate the law. Now, is it an accurate representation of your views to suggest that you argued that executive branch officials should be fully immunized for their violations of the law?
Judge ALITO. No, it is not a correct expression of my views. The President, like everybody else, has to follow the Constitution and the laws. He has to follow the Constitution at all times and he has to follow all the laws that are enacted consistent with the Constitution. That’s clear.
Now, on the Mitchell v. Forsythe case, which they may be referring to, that was simply—I was simply saying that a certain argument relating to immunity from civil damages was an argument that had been made before and it was an argument that was being requested by our client in the case who was being sued in his individual capacity, and I recommended that we not make the argument, but I said, I don’t dispute this argument, and that’s all that was involved there.
Senator HATCH. Let me just say this. I want to allow you to respond to a tactic that has been used by several of our colleagues here in these hearings. They observed results in some past cases and then they expressed concerns that entire groups or categories of litigants might not be able to get a fair shake by you in the court. One of them yesterday wondered whether the average citizen, quote, ‘‘can get a fair shake from you when the government is a party.’’ Another did the same thing this morning. It is one thing to express disagreement with your decisions, and, of course, as I said before, to look only at results and ignore the facts and

489
the law is fundamentally misguided and it is a misleading way of evaluating judicial decisions.
But let us be clear what is being floated around here with this type of tactic. Those who say, because you ruled this way in the past, litigants cannot get a fair shake in the future, are saying, Judge, that you are biased, that you prejudge these cases, that you are less than fair and impartial, something that virtually everybody who knows you, including all of the people who testified before the American Bar Association, say is false, that you prejudge these cases, you are less than fair and impartial. That is a very serious charge, even if it is cloaked in suggestions and innuendo.
Judge, you previously mentioned you oath of office, an oath before God to do equal justice to everyone without regard to who the parties are. How do you react to this suggestion that the way you have ruled in the past shows or even suggests that you are biased and that entire categories of litigants may not get a fair shake before you?
Judge ALITO. Well, I reject that. I believe very strongly in treating everybody who comes before me absolutely equal. I take that oath very seriously and I have tried to do my very best to abide by that during my 15 years on the bench.
Now, I don’t think a judge should be keeping a scorecard about how many times the judge votes for one category of litigant versus another in particular types of cases. That would be wrong. We are supposed to do justice on an individual basis in the cases that come before us. But I think that if anybody looks at the categories of— looks at the cases that I have voted on in any of the categories of cases that have been cited, they will see that there are decisions on both sides. In every type of employment discrimination case, for example, there are decisions on both sides.
Senator HATCH. Most employment discrimination cases really are decided at the lower level.
Judge ALITO. Most of them are, yes. Senator HATCH. And when they get up to your level, it is generally decided on technical or procedural bases. Am I wrong in that? Judge ALITO. No, that is correct, Senator. Senator HATCH. And sometimes you have to uphold the law, even though you may be uncomfortable with the law yourself. Judge ALITO. We have to decide the cases on the facts that are in the record and the law that applies. Senator HATCH. That is right. Let me just ask you about a few of your cases, because it is easy to cherry-pick these cases and find a sentence here you don’t like and a sentence there you don’t like and criticize you in the process as though you are not being fair when, in fact, everybody who knows you knows your impeccable reputation for fairness, dignity, decency, honor, and capacity, and that is why you got the highest rating from the American Bar Association and deserve it, and you twice got that, and I know how tough they can be. But let me just give you a couple of illustrations. Zubi v. AT&T. You were the lone dissenter in that case. What did you dissent from?

Judge ALITO. I dissented from a majority decision that held that Mr. Zubi, who was claiming racial discrimination, would not have his day in court because of the statutory—
Senator HATCH. You would have given him his day in court, right—
Judge ALITO. I would have, yes— Senator HATCH [continuing]. If it had been up to you? Judge ALITO. Yes. Senator HATCH. All right. How about U.S. v. Kithcart? I don’t expect you to remember all these cases, and if you don’t, just raise your hand and I will try and recite them, but this was a Fourth Amendment case. You held that the Fourth Amendment does not allow police to target drivers because of the color of their skin, is that right? Judge ALITO. That is right. That was essentially a case of racial profiling and I wrote an opinion holding that that was a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Senator HATCH. And that was even after a police officer received a report that two black men in a black sportscar had committed three robberies, and she pulled over the first black man in a black sportscar, or the first black sportscar she saw. But you ruled for the defendant and against racial profiling in that case. Judge ALITO. That’s correct, Senator. Senator HATCH. OK. In Thomas v. Commissioner of Social Security, just to mention a few of these cases to show that you are going to do what is right, regardless. Sometimes in these employment cases and even other cases, when they get up on appeal, they are fairly technical in nature and you have got to do what is right under the law. But in Thomas v. Commissioner of Social Security— do you recall that case? Judge ALITO. I do, yes. Senator HATCH. What did you do there? Judge ALITO. Well, that was a case where I think that the Supreme Court thought that my opinion had gone too far in favor of the little guy who was involved there. That was a— Senator HATCH. This was a woman with disabilities, right? Judge ALITO. That’s right, a woman who was trying to get— Senator HATCH. And she sought Social Security benefits. Judge ALITO.—Social Security disability benefits, and in order to be eligible for those, she had to be unable to perform any job that existed in substantial numbers in the national economy. Senator HATCH. She had a job as an elevator operator, if I recall. Judge ALITO. That’s right. As the case was presented to us, the only job that she could perform was her past job, which was as an elevator operator, and what I said was that you can’t deny somebody Social Security benefits because the person is able to do a job that no longer exists in any substantial numbers in the national economy. You can’t deny benefits based on a hypothetical job. It has to be based on a real job. And the Supreme Court didn’t see it that way, but it seems to me that the way we ruled was consistent with what I thought— Senator HATCH. So in other words, you stood up for the person seeking rights here. The Supreme Court overruled you. Judge ALITO. That’s right.

Senator HATCH. Oh my goodness. In the landmark case of, how do you pronounce it, Fatin v. INS?
Judge ALITO. ‘‘Fatten,’’ I think. Senator HATCH. This involved an Iranian woman—Iranian women who refused to conform to their government’s gender-specific laws and social norms, whether or not they should be granted asylum in America. How did you rule in that case? Judge ALITO. I think that was one of the first cases in the Federal courts to hold that requiring a woman to be returned to a country where she would have to wear a veil and conform to other practices like that would amount to persecution if that was deeply offensive to her and that subjecting a woman to persecution in Iran or any other country to which she would be returned based on feminism would be persecution on the basis of political opinion. Senator HATCH. I have got another nine or ten cases and perhaps even more than I could go through, but the point is that whenever they deserve to win, they win, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, whether they are powerful or not. You basically upheld the law in these cases, is that correct? Judge ALITO. That is what I’ve tried to do. Senator HATCH. And where you have been in dissent, you have tried to do it to the best of your ability. Judge ALITO. That’s right, Senator. Senator HATCH. OK. Let me just mention one other thing. This business of Vanguard, when you signed that back in 1990, 12 years before the matter for which you are being criticized, not by anybody who has any ethical, professorial, or other knowledge, not by the American Bar Association, not by the vast majority of lawyers who look at these matters, that particular statement said, will you during your, quote, ‘‘initial service.’’ It seems to me those are important words. You haven’t tried to hide behind that. You have just honestly explained that, basically, you made a mistake, which really wasn’t a mistake according to all the ethics people and according to the American Bar Association. And now, instead of the original accusation and the original implication, you are being accused of not being forthcoming because of that original statement on your application form, to the Committee questionnaire. But the fact of the matter is that, quote, ‘‘initial service’’ doesn’t mean 12 years away, does it, when there is no chance in the world that you had ever received any monetary benefit from Vanguard? Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t think initial service means 12 years away— Senator HATCH. Neither do I and neither does anybody who cares about justice and about what is right in this matter. So to blow that out of proportion like your adversaries have done is really pretty offensive. I could go on and on and be stronger on that, but the fact of the matter is, I just wanted to make that statement. ‘‘Initial service,’’ unquote, is pretty clear. Let me just say that, sometimes, I just can’t make sense out of what some of your critics are saying. On the one hand, they want to portray you as some sort of a robotic patsy for big government who does not think for himself. Yesterday, one of my Democratic colleagues even suggested that the Bush administration was trying to manipulate you to give responses favorable to them in this hear-

ing. Now, you quite rightly said, and I think you were fairly restrained about saying it, that you have been a judge for 15 years and are quite capable of thinking for yourself.
On the other hand, then your critics then turn it around and attack you for supposedly dissenting too much, as if you should actually stop doing all that thinking for yourself and just fall in line with the majority in all of your cases.
Now, Judge, I know that appeals court judges—that the appeals courts themselves are collegial bodies, but how do you view dissenting from your colleagues? How do you decide when to do it? How do you know how often you dissent in your court, or do you know how often you dissent in your court and whether it is out of step with your colleagues? Could you give us some answers there?
Judge ALITO. Yes. I think that it is important for a multi-member court to issue a judgment and to speak clearly to the lower courts and the parties. And so when I’ve been in a position where taking an independent position would result in the absence of a judgment. I had gone out of my way to make sure that there was a judgment, that there was a majority opinion. An example of that is the Rappa case where we were really divided three ways, and my position was close to Judge Becker’s opinion, and Judge Becker had the opinion-writing assignment, and I issued an opinion saying, ‘‘I don’t completely agree with the way Judge Becker analyzed this issue. I would analyze it differently. But I’m joining his opinion so that there is a majority opinion, so that there is a clear statement of the law for the guidance of the parties.’’ I think that’s the first principle.
Second is that judges should be respectful of each other’s views, and I don’t have any—I have tried never to write a dissenting opinion or respond in a majority opinion to a dissenting opinion in a way that was not completely respectful of the views of the other members of the court.
It’s useful to dissent if there’s a chance that the case may go en banc, and that’s happened in a number of cases where I’ve dissented. It’s useful to dissent if there is a chance that the case may go to the Supreme Court and so that the Supreme Court will have the benefit of a different expression of views, and there have been cases—
Senator HATCH. Well, would it surprise you to know that you have dissented only 79 times in nearly 5,000 cases in which you have participated? That comes to about 1.6 percent, which is considerably lower than most others who have been on the appellate courts. And I would observe that the Washington Post concluded in an editorial that your dissenting opinions ‘‘are the work of a serious and scholarly judge whose arguments deserve respect.’’ I certainly agree wholeheartedly with that assessment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, I hadn’t planned to get into Vanguard on this particular round, but I chaired those hearings when you were promoted to the circuit court, and I was also the one that filed those questions which you responded to. And you responded under oath

when you promised the Committee that you would recuse yourself on Vanguard issues.
Now I am just hearing from you that you believe that that pledge was somehow conditioned. Unlike my friend—and he is my friend— from Iowa that says, well, a pledge is just a pledge, it is like any political pledge around here. It is a political promise and doesn’t carry much weight.
That is not my opinion, and I don’t think it is the opinion of most of the Members of this body. You made a pledge to the Senate, effectively to the American people, that you were going to recuse yourself. Now you say, well, it was just for an initial time, and I think 12 years is more than I really had in mind, or you just qualified your answer.
How long, when you made that pledge and that promise to the Committee, how long did you intend to keep it?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator— Senator KENNEDY. And when that time was up, did you ever imagine that you might get back to the Committee and say, ‘‘I believe my time is up on Vanguard’’? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, the statement that I—the nature of the question that I was responding to did not figure in the way the Monga case was handled, and I thought I made that clear yesterday. I was following throughout my time on the bench the practice of going beyond the code, and had I focused on this issue when the matter came before me, I would have recused myself at that time, as I later did. But in answer to Senator Hatch’s question, looking at that question today and looking at the answer, the question was: What do you intend to do during your initial period of service? And I think that that’s what the answer has to be read as responding to. But just to be clear, that was not—I’m not saying that that’s why this played out the way it did. I’m just saying that’s how I think the question and the answer—that’s how I think the question and any response to the answer by any nominee needs to be interpreted. Senator KENNEDY. Well, if there is someone that can just understand what you just told us, I would be interested in it, because I don’t. Senator HATCH. Well, I will be glad to explain it. Senator KENNEDY. Well, if—Mr. Chairman. [Laughter.] Senator KENNEDY. You in response to Senator Hatch did not believe you were bound by the promise because you said in your mind you felt that it was just for the initial period of it. That is another issue, because initially it was meant to include the investments that you had at that particular time. You might have those investments and then discard an investment and, therefore, no longer have a conflict. That is what—as the asker of the question had intended. But you have added another wrinkle to it. You have just indicated that when you made a pledge to the Committee that you were going to recuse yourself, that you thought that at some time you were going to be released. And I would just like to know how long that was going to be. Was that going to be 2 years? Was it going to be 3 years? Was it going to be 5 years? When did you feel that you were going to be released if that—

Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I— Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. If we followed your interpretation? Judge ALITO. Senator, I did not rely on that time limitation in relation to what I did in the Monga case, and I hope I have made that clear. If I didn’t in my previous answer, I do want to make it clear. I did not rely on that in my handling of the Monga case. Looking at the question now, where it says ‘‘initial period of service,’’ I would say that 12 years late is not the initial period of service. But that was not— Senator KENNEDY. When did it stop, then? When did you think that your pledge to the Committee halted, after how many years? Six months? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I don’t— Senator KENNEDY. What did you intend at the time that you made the pledge? What was in your mind at that time? I am not interested in what is in your mind at this time, but what was in your mind at that time. Judge ALITO. I can’t specifically recall what was in my mind at that time, but I’ll tell you what I’m pretty sure I had in mind. I was not a judge, and I was being considered for a judicial position. And what I was trying to express was basically the policy that I followed during all my years on the bench, which is to bend over backwards to make sure that I didn’t do anything that came close to violating the code of conduct or give anybody the impression that I was doing anything that was improper. Senator KENNEDY. The last question on this is: How long, then, when you made the promise under oath to the Committee that you were going to recuse yourself—and you understand that now to be—in your own interpretation just to be the initial time—how long did you think that that pledge and promise lasted? Judge ALITO. Senator, as I said— Senator KENNEDY. That is my question. Judge ALITO. And, Senator, as I said, I can’t tell you 15 years later exactly what I thought when I read that question. It refers to the initial period of service, and looking at it now, it doesn’t seem to me that 12 years later is the initial period of service. Senator KENNEDY. Well, my question to you, which I guess I’m not going to get an answer to, is: When did it? Is 10 years—how about 3 years, is that— Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t know exactly what the time limitation would be, but 12 years does seem to me not to be the initial period. Senator KENNEDY. We will come back. I just want to mention, in fairness to my friend and colleague—both my friends, Senator Hatch and Senator Durbin, in Senator Hatch’s quoting of Senator Durbin that you responded on the question of the Roe v. Wade in the—when you were in the circuit court, I have here the record that said—of the hearings of Roberts, and the question was asked by Senator Specter to Judge Roberts during the time of his consideration for the Supreme Court. So I want that to be—Senator Durbin can clarify the record, but I wanted that to be clarified so that there wasn’t a confusion about it. Now, in the time that I have, Judge Alito, I listened carefully to responses that you gave to Senator Leahy about the CAP organiza-

tion at Princeton. And I listened to other responses that you gave to our colleagues, and again to Senator Durbin earlier today. But I have just some questions on this to at least try to finalize, at least in my mind, and it might be useful in the Committee’s mind as well.
You had indicated in your 1985 job application that you were a member of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy and a regular participant at its luncheon and a member of the Concerned Alumni of Princeton University, a conservative alumni group. And you said yesterday that you racked your memory about the issue and really had no specific recollection of the organization. Is that correct?
Judge ALITO. I have no specific recollection of joining the organization.
Senator KENNEDY. And you also said yesterday and today to Senator Durbin that you very likely joined CAP because of your concern over the ROTC program being kicked off campus. Is that correct?
Judge ALITO. Well, what I said specifically was that I racked my memory as to why I might have joined, and the issue that had bothered me for a period of time as an undergraduate and in the 1980s, around the time of this—when I made this statement, was the issue of ROTC. This was the issue about the administration of Princeton that bothered me. I had a high regard for Princeton in many respects in general and had participated in a lot of their activities. But this issue bothered me a great deal at various times. That’s what I said.
Senator KENNEDY. And, finally, you said yesterday that you very likely joined CAP around 1985 just before you were applying to the high-level job in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan. I think that is correct.
Judge ALITO. Senator, what I specifically said, as I recall, is that if I had done anything substantial in relation to this group, including renewing my membership, I would remember that. And I do not remember that.
Senator KENNEDY. So I want to ask a few things that I hope can clear this up. You have no memory of being a member. You graduated from Princeton in 1972, the same year CAP was founded. You call CAP a conservative alumni group.
It also published a publication called Prospect, which includes articles by CAP members about the policies that the organization promoted. You are familiar with that?
Judge ALITO. I don’t recall seeing the magazine. I might— Senator KENNEDY. But you know that they had a magazine? Judge ALITO. I have been—I have learned of that in recent weeks. Senator KENNEDY. So a 1983 Prospect essay titled ‘‘In Defense of Elitism’’ stated, ‘‘People nowadays just don’t seem to know their place. Everywhere one turns, blacks and Hispanics are demanding jobs simply because they’re black and Hispanic. The physically handicapped are trying to gain equal representation in professional sports, and homosexuals are demanding that Government vouchsafe them the right to bear children.’’ Did you read that, that article?

Senator FEINSTEIN. Finish the last line. Senator KENNEDY. Finish the last line. ‘‘And homosexuals are’’— Senator FEINSTEIN. ‘‘And now here come women.’’ Senator KENNEDY. If the Senator would let me just— Senator FEINSTEIN. Yes, I— [Laughter.] Senator KENNEDY. Can I get 2 more minutes from my friend? Just to continue along—I apologize, Judge. Did you read this article? Judge ALITO. I feel confident that I didn’t. If that—I am not familiar with the article, and I don’t have a context in which those things were said. But they are antithetical to— Senator KENNEDY. Well, could you think of any context that they could be— Judge ALITO. It’s hard to imagine. If that’s what anybody was endorsing, I disagree with all of that. I would never endorse it. I never have endorsed it. Had I thought that that’s what this organization stood for, I would never associate myself with it in any way. Senator KENNEDY. The June 1984 edition of Prospect magazine contains a short article on AIDS. I know that we have come a long way since then in our understanding of the disease, but even for that time, the insensitivity of statements in this article are breathtaking. It announces that a team of doctors has found that the AIDS virus in Rhesus monkeys was similar to the virus occurring in human beings. And the article then goes on with this terrible statement: ‘‘Now the scientist must find humans—or, rather, homosexuals to submit themselves to experimental treatment. Perhaps Princeton’s Gay Alliance may want to hold an election.’’ You didn’t read that article? Judge ALITO. I feel confident that I didn’t, Senator, because I would not have anything to do with statements of that nature. Senator KENNEDY. In 1973, a year after you graduated, and during your first year at Yale Law School, former Senator Bill Bradley very publicly disassociated himself with CAP because of its rightwing views and unsupported allegations about the university. His letter of resignation was published in the Prospect, garnered much attention on campus and among the alumni. Were you aware at the time of that, at the time that you listed the organization in your application? Judge ALITO. I don’t think I was aware of that until recent weeks when I was informed of it. Senator KENNEDY. And in 1974, an alumni panel including nowSenator Frist unanimously concluded that CAP had presented a distorted, narrow, hostile view of the university. Were you aware of that at the time of the job application? Judge ALITO. I was not aware of it until very recently. Senator KENNEDY. In 1980, the New York Times article about the coeducation of Princeton, CAP is described as an organization against the admittance of women. In 1980, you were working as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Trenton, New Jersey. Did you read the New York Times? Did you see this article? Judge ALITO. I don’t believe that I saw the article. Senator KENNEDY. And did you read a letter from CAP mailed in 1984—this is the year before you put CAP on your application—

to every living alumni—to every living alumni, so I assume you received it—which declared Princeton is no longer the university you knew it to be. As evidence, among other reasons, it cited the fact that admission rates for African-Americans and Hispanics were on the rise while those of alumni children were falling, and Princeton’s president, at the time, had urged the then-all-male eating clubs to admit females.
And in December 1984, President William Bowen responded by sending his own letter. This is the president of Princeton—he responded by sending his own letter to all of the alumni in which he called CAP’s letter callous and outrageous. This letter was the subject of a January 1985 Wall Street Journal editorial, congratulating President Bowen for engaging his critics in a free and open debate. This would be right about the time that you told Senator Kyl you probably joined the organization. Did you receive the Bowen letter or did you read the Wall Street Journal, which was pretty familiar reading for certainly a lot of people that were in the Reagan administration?
Judge ALITO. Senator, I testified to everything that I can recall relating to this and I do not recall knowing any of these things about the organization, and many of the things that you’ve mentioned are things that I have always stood against. In your description of the letter that prompted President Bowen’s letter, there is talk about returning the Princeton that used to be. There is talk about eating clubs, about all-male eating clubs. There is talk about the admission of alumni children. There is opposition to opening up the admissions process.
None of that is something that I would identify with. I was not the son of an alumnus. I was not a member of an eating club. I was not a member of an eating facility that was selective. I was not a member of an all-male eating facility and I would not have identified with any of that. If I had received any information at any point regarding any of the matters that you have referred to in relation to this organization, I would never have had anything to do with it.
Senator KENNEDY. Do you think that these are conservative views?
Judge ALITO. Senator, whatever I knew about this organization in 1985, I identified as conservative. I don’t identify those views as conservative. What I do recall as an issue that bothered me in relation to the Princeton administration as an undergraduate and continuing into the 1980s was their treatment of the ROTC unit and their general attitude toward the military, which they did not treat with the respect that I thought was deserving. The idea that it was beneath Princeton to have an ROTC unit on campus was an offensive idea to me.
Senator KENNEDY. Just moving on, you mentioned—and I only have a few minutes left—you joined CAP because of your concern about keeping ROTC on campus. Now, ROTC was a fairly contentious issue on Princeton’s campus in the early 1970s. The program was slated to be terminated in 1970, when you were an undergraduate. By 1973, 1 year after you graduated, ROTC had returned to campus and was no longer a source of debate. And from what I can tell, by 1985, it was basically a dead issue. In fact, my staff

reviewed the editions of Prospect from 1983 to 1985 and could find only one mention of ROTC, and it appears in a 1985 issue released for homecoming that year that says, ‘‘ROTC is Popular Once Again.’’ Here is the Prospect, 1985, ‘‘ROTC is Popular Once Again.’’ This is just about the time that you were submitting this organization in your job application.
Judge ALITO. Senator—I’m sorry. Senator KENNEDY. Briefly, please. Judge ALITO. It’s my recollection that this was a continuing source of controversy. There were people on the campus, members of the faculty, as I recall, who wanted the unit removed from the campus. There was certainly controversy about whether students could get credit for courses, which I believe was a military requirement for the maintenance of the unit. There was controversy, as I recall, about the status of the instructors, whether they could be given any kind of a status in relation to the faculty. I don’t know the exact dates, but it’s my recollection that this was a continuing source of controversy. Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, my time is running out. I had wanted to just wind up on a few more brief questions on this. But I have to say that Judge Alito, that his explanations about his membership in this sort of radical group and why you listed it on your job application are extremely troubling. In fact, I don’t think that they add up. Last month, I sent a letter to Senator Specter asking a number of questions about your membership in CAP and I asked Senator Specter to make a formal Committee request for the documents in the possession of the Library of Congress as part of the William Rusher papers. Mr. Rusher was the publisher of the National Review, was an active founder and leader of CAP. Do you have any hesitation or reason for us not to look at those documents? Judge ALITO. They’re not my documents, Senator, and I have no— Senator KENNEDY. Do you think they would be helpful to us? Judge ALITO [continuing]. Opinion about it whatsoever. Senator KENNEDY. Do you think they would be helpful? Judge ALITO. Senator, I don’t believe I had any active involvement with this group. Senator KENNEDY. Well— Judge ALITO. I have racked my memory and I can’t recall anything, and if I had been involved actively in any way in the group, I’m sure that I would remember that. Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, if I could have your attention, I think we ought to vote on issuing a subpoena to the custodian of those CAP records. I want to do that at an appropriate time. I move that the Committee go into executive session for the purpose of voting on the issuance of the subpoena of those records. Chairman SPECTER. We will consider that, Senator Kennedy. There are many, many requests which are coming to me from many quarters. Quite candidly, I view the request, if it is really a matter of importance, you and I see each other all the time. You have never mentioned it to me. I do not ascribe a great deal of weight. We actually didn’t get a letter, but— Senator KENNEDY. You did get a letter, are you saying?

Chairman SPECTER. Well, now wait a minute. You don’t know what I got. I am about to—

Doesn’t necessarily know what the recipient gets, Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. I have got it right here. Chairman SPECTER. You are not in the position to say what I received. If you will bear with me for just one minute— Senator KENNEDY. But I am in a position to say what I sent to you on December 22, so I renew my— Chairman SPECTER. You are in a position to tell me what you sent. Senator KENNEDY. I renew my request, Senator, and if I am going to be denied, then I would appeal the decision of the Chair. I think we are entitled to this information. It deals with the fundamental issues of equality and discrimination. This nominee has indicated he has no objection to us seeing these issues. We have gone over the questions and we are entitled to get that kind of information. And if you are going to rule it out of order, I want to have a vote on that here on our Committee. Chairman SPECTER. Well, don’t be premature, Senator Kennedy. I am not about to make a ruling on this state of the record. I hope you won’t mind if I consider it, and I hope you won’t mind if I give you the specifics that there was no letter which I received. I take umbrage at your telling me what I received. I don’t mind your telling me what you mailed. But there is a big difference between what is mailed and what is received and you know that. We are going to move on now. Senator Grassley? Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I would appeal the ruling of the Chair on this. I want— Chairman SPECTER. There has been no ruling of the Chair, Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. But my request is that we go into executive session for the sole purpose of voting on a subpoena for these records that are held over at the Library of Congress, for that purpose and that purpose only, and if I am going to be denied that, I would want to give notice to the Chair that you are going to have it again and again and again and we are going to have votes of this Committee again and again and again until we have a resolution. I think that— Chairman SPECTER. Well, Senator Kennedy, I am not concerned about your threats to have votes again, again, and again, and I am the Chairman of this Committee and I have heard your request and I will consider it, and I am not going to have you run this Committee and decide when we are going to go into executive session. We are in the middle of a round of hearings. This is the first time you have personally called it to my attention and this is the first time that I have focused on it and I will consider it in due course. Now, we will move to Senator Grassley for 20 minutes.

Senator GRASSLEY. We have gone over this same ground many times. I suppose, maybe to some extent, both sides are guilty of that. We have an old saying in the Midwest about if a horse is dead, quit beating it, and I think several horses have been beaten to death, particularly on the other side, and you have been very consistent in your answers and I thank you. I think that that speaks to the intellectual honesty of your positions.
It is kind of like we are in the fourth quarter of a football game and you are the quarterback and your team is way ahead here in the fourth quarter. Opponents are very desperate, trying to sack you, and aren’t doing a very good job of it. They haven’t hit you all day now for 2 days. You are going to keep getting these lastminute ‘‘Hail Marys’’ thrown at you, so just bear with us.
I want to compliment you, first of all, before I ask some questions, and I just did to some extent about the consistency of your testimony, but I think it has been good. I think under very difficult circumstances, you have handled yourself very well, being responsive, forthright, thoughtful. I sense in you a person that is very sincere, and obviously, I don’t know you except this appearance here and the small period of time we spent in my office. It seems like you have modesty. That is a breath of fresh air, demonstrating a command of and very much a respect for the law and the Constitution, of course.
This is all stuff that we ought to be looking for in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton saying the role of the Senate is to make sure that only competent people get on the Court and that political hacks don’t get on the Court. You are surely no political hack and you are very competent, and that has been demonstrated with your fair and open-minded approach to your being a judicial person.
It is too bad that we are getting this misconstruing of your record or the answers, the claim that you have not written a single opinion on the merits in favor of a person of color alleging race discrimination on the job in your 15 years on the bench. I have looked at a lot of opinions you have given and it is just not true. Your record shows that you ruled in favor of minorities making allegations of racial discrimination in employment, not once but in a number of cases.
The claim that you acted unethically in the Vanguard case just is not true. You did nothing improper and actually went beyond the rule to ensure compliance. The claim that you would support an unchecked Executive is just not true. Your record shows that you have repeatedly ruled against the government and that you have told us no one, including the President, is above the law.
The claim that you have ruled the vast majority of the time against the claims of individual citizens in favor of the government and large corporations is just not true. The reality, as I see it, is that you have found in favor of the little guy in numerous cases, but because of who was right and who was wrong, not just because you have got a bias one way or the other. Your critics are, I think, grasping at any straw to tarnish your record, and that is unfortunate.
Judge Alito, in your opening statement, you said, and I hope I quote you accurately, no person in this country, no matter how high or powerful, is above the law, and no person in this country

is beneath the law. You didn’t go into detail about what you meant. I think it is quite clear, above the law, but give us that diverse opinion, above the law versus beneath the law.
Judge ALITO. Every person has equal rights under the law in this country, and that involves people who have no money—that includes people who have no money. That includes people who do not hold any higher or prestigious position. It includes people who are citizens and people who are not citizens. Everybody is entitled to be treated equally under the law, and I think that’s one of the greatest things about our country and about our legal system.
Senator GRASSLEY. You have been criticized for being hostile to voting rights based upon a statement that you wrote 20 years ago when you were applying for a job with the Justice Department during the Reagan years. In fact, yesterday, some of my colleagues repeated that assertion, but it is apparent to me that it is off the mark.
Specifically, in your 1985 statement, you wrote that you became interested in constitutional law and went to law school in part because you had some disagreements over Warren Court decisions, including some regarding reapportionment. Of course, that is understandable because the Warren Court had handed down very many decisions on reapportionment and they had been criticized as unworkable and that, in fact, the Supreme Court backed away from some. So there was disagreement, there was debate over those issues at that time, probably a lot less today but still recently there is going to be a case going to the Court.
Some have questioned your 1985 statement regarding electoral reapportionment, that is how districts are drawn. They have suggested that you are hostile to the principle of one person/one vote. Clarify for me. Nowhere in your 1985 statement did I find that you wrote that you ever disagreed with the principle of one person/one vote, did you?
Judge ALITO. I never disagreed with that principle, Senator. What I disagreed with when I was in college was the application of the principle in some of the—the elaboration of the principle in some of the late Warren Court decisions, and this grew out of my father’s work with the New Jersey legislature. He had been the Secretary to the State Constitutional Convention in 1966, which redrew the provisions of the State Constitution relating to the composition of the legislature in an effort to bring it into compliance with the one person/one vote standard.
These provisions, however, because they tried to respect county and municipal lines, as I recall, resulted in population deviations of under 10 percent, but those deviations were much higher than the ones that the Supreme Court said in the late decisions that I’m talking about would be tolerated regarding congressional districts. There was a belief that that principle would be applied across the board, both to congressional districts and to legislative districts, and that would have wiped out the plan that had been adopted. And I was quite familiar with all of this, and it seemed to me an instance of taking a good principle, which is one person/one vote, and taking it to extremes, requiring that districts be exactly equal in population, which did not seem to me to be a sensible idea.

502
Senator GRASSLEY. Isn’t it true that the words ‘‘one person/one vote’’ weren’t even in your statement?
Judge ALITO. Those words are not in my statement. Senator GRASSLEY. Just to make—go ahead. Judge ALITO. Just to add, Senator, that this issue of how nearly exact the districts had to be was an issue that was working its way to the Supreme Court or maybe it had actually been there—I’ve forgotten the exact chronology—at the time of the 1985 statement in Karcher v. Daggett, which involved the New Jersey Congressional districting plan. Senator GRASSLEY. Well, just to make sure that there is no lingering confusion then, let me ask you straight out: Do you believe in the principle of one person/one vote? Judge ALITO. I do. I think it’s a fundamental part of our constitutional law. Senator GRASSLEY. I find it curious that the same people who are questioning your integrity are either asserting or implying that you took a position against the principle of one man or one person/one vote when it is demonstrably false that you ever did. Further, on another point, some have suggested that you are hostile to women and minorities. Obviously, I don’t think that is the case. I think you have demonstrated that sincerity in just very recent statements today. Now, in the Washington Post article, Alberto Rivas, a criminal defense lawyer and a Democrat, said you ‘‘took steps to diversify an office’’—this is when you were U.S. Attorney. You ‘‘took steps to diversify an office that had a reputation as something of a white boys’ club.’’ Rivas said that when you hired him at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey, he was the only Latino lawyer in the office, and by the time you left that office, Rivas said there were four Latino lawyers as well as African-American lawyers. Your commitment also included advancing women attorneys and promoting them into senior positions during your tenure as U.S. Attorney. And I understand that when you started in that office, only two of the 15 divisional leadership attorneys, chiefs or deputy chiefs, or attorneys in charge were women, and 2 years later you had more than doubled that number, and 5 of the 17 divisional leadership attorneys were women. Now, on the Federal bench, you have hired many women and minorities to serve as law clerks, and you had a discussion with Senator Brownback earlier mentioning some very complimentary things that Cathy Fleming, your former deputy chief and acting chief of the Special Prosecutions Unit in the New Jersey office, and David Walk, a former lawyer in that office, had to say about you and your treatment of women and minorities. They both, being lifelong Democrats, vouched in those statements for your qualities as a judge and your respect for individual rights. And, Mr. Chairman, if these letters—and they may have already been put in the record, but if they aren’t in the record, I would like to have those put in the record. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Senator GRASSLEY. Several of your dissents have been referred to today, or in the last 2 days, and so I wanted to comment on this

suggestion that you are way out of the mainstream because you have written a lot of dissenting opinions. I don’t find that you have written so many as a percentage of your total thing, but whatever reason you did it, you did it with good reason.
But judges disagree all the time, and that is to be expected, and obviously there is nothing wrong with that. And, in fact, the Supreme Court has agreed with your dissents on several occasions, I recall from reading a synopsis of your opinions, and the reality is, as I see it, you don’t disagree with majority opinions more frequently than most Federal appeals judges do in similar cases. And of more than 4,800 cases—and that we got from the Washington Post. But of more than 4,800 cases that you decided during your tenure on the Third Circuit, you dissented only in 79 cases, which would be only 1.6 percent of all those cases.
So, you know, I don’t think that there is anything very extraordinary about the number of dissents or the dissents, and particularly when the Supreme Court has agreed with your opinion in reversing the Third Circuit.
I would like to go to the issue of some historical basis for our constitutional law. The role of historical precedent in constitutional laws I find very interesting. For example, qui tam lawsuits have been a feature of Anglo-American law since the Middle Ages and have been a common feature of Federal statutory law even since the 1st Congress. Yet their constitutionality has never been clearly adjudicated by the Supreme Court.
What role does longstanding, historical practice play in assessing the constitutionality of a Government act or practice?
Judge ALITO. Well, it can be very relevant in many instances. One place where this has come up is when a statute was passed by the 1st Congress—and this has happened on a number of occasions. The 1st Congress, which was responsible for the Bill of Rights, passed a number of statutes relating to provisions of the Bill of Rights, and the Supreme Court has often looked to those and said this is the same Congress that proposed the Bill of Rights, and they did this in enacting a statute, so that gives us a good indication of what they had in mind. And when there has been a legal practice that has existed for—that predated the Constitution, then that certainly is relevant in considering its constitutionality.
Senator GRASSLEY. I would like to have you think about legislative history and how you might use it or how often you might use it, or even how often—maybe if you got a rough quantifiable answer, how often you might use it. The Supreme Court, I think, has quite often stated legislative history of a particular bill would be critical in their interpretation of it. What is your position with respect to legislative history? How important is it to you? And how have you utilized history in interpreting statutes?
Judge ALITO. I have often looked to legislative history in the cases that I’ve written concerning statutory interpretation. And I think if anybody looks at those opinions, they will see that.
When I interpret a statute, I do begin with the text of the statute. I think that certainly is the clearest indication of what Congress as a whole had in mind in passing the statute. And sometimes the language of the statute is dispositive and it is really—
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00515 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

504
the decision can be made based on the language of the statute itself.
But when there is an ambiguity in the statute, I think it is entirely legitimate to look to legislative history, and as I said, I have often done that. I think it needs to be done with caution. Just because one Member of Congress said something on the floor, obviously that doesn’t necessarily reflect the view of the majority who voted for the legislation. So it has to be done carefully and I think with a realistic evaluation of the legislative process, but I’m not one of the judges who thinks that you should never look to legislative history. I think it has its place.
Senator GRASSLEY. Are you familiar with the legal arguments that some opponents of the False Claims Act have made to the effect that its qui tam provisions are unconstitutional under Articles II and III? And if you are, do you have any opinion on those arguments that are used without prejudicing any review of it you might give?
Judge ALITO. Well, the issue hasn’t come up before me. I have a little bit of familiarity with the arguments. And I don’t think I— I think that all I can say on the question is that the qui tam statute is of historical origin, as you pointed out, and we have seen what it has produced in terms of tangible results in the cases that have been brought under the statute in recent years. And should an issue relating to its constitutionality come before me, either on the Third Circuit or the Supreme Court, then I would have to follow that whole judicial process that I’ve described and evaluate the arguments and certainly study the question much more thoroughly than I have done up to this point.
Senator GRASSLEY. You may have just answered this question, but I would like to get it explicitly on the record. Have you ever written or spoken publicly about the issue of the constitutionality of qui tam or any other provision of the False Claims Act, and if so, the circumstances and the context?
Judge ALITO. I’m quite sure I’ve never written or spoken about its constitutionality.
Senator GRASSLEY. Do you feel that you have any bias against the False Claims Act or Whistle-Blower Protection Act that would impact the ability of you to fairly decide cases involving those issues?
Judge ALITO. I certainly don’t, Senator. Senator GRASSLEY. I would like to ask you about the opinion you authored in Mystic. As author of the legislation that we call the False Claims Act, it has returned billions of dollars to the Federal Government and has become a very effective tool in combating fraud against the American taxpayers. So I follow court cases on this as much as I can. The False Claims Act contains a provision that jurisdictionally bars lawsuits based on public disclosure, including such things as administrative reports and investigations. The purpose of this provision is to prevent an individual who has read about a description of a fraud in a newspaper report, public document, or Government report from simply taking that material and using it as a basis for a case.

505
In Mystic, the qui tam relater had made a FOIA request and utilized some of the documents he received in response to FOIA in filing that qui tam case. In your opinion, you determined that the qui tam relater had based his False Claims Act lawsuit on public disclosure made in an administrative report or investigation. To come to that conclusion, you had to equate that the qui tam relater, who was acting on behalf of the Government, as the public. But I think it is clear that Congress did not equate such qui tam relaters with the public when it wrote the public disclosure bar provision. That is because if Congress had done so, then everything qui tam relaters know is known to the public, which doesn’t make any sense.
So because my time has run out, I don’t want to go on with a question, but do you see what I am getting at? Could you react to that?
Judge ALITO. I do, and I understand that’s a very strong argument. I remember that I found that a very difficult issue to deal with, and I spent a lot of time on it, and my view of the matter elicited a strong and a very persuasive, I think, dissent by one of my colleagues. So it is a tough issue, and if that were to come up again, I would have to really reconsider it.
Senator GRASSLEY. Just in your last sentence, you gave pretty much the same answer that Judge Roberts did. He had dissented in a case, too, and it kind of worries me when we get two of you on the Court that may be unfamiliar with congressional intent on false claims.
Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Grassley. That will be all. We will recess until 2 o’clock. Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman? Chairman SPECTER. Yes, Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Just as a quick matter of personal privilege, I would like to include in the record the response from your staff to this letter that I wrote to you on the 22nd and also my staff response to your staff’s response to the letter, include them in the record.

Mr. Chairman, I sent you a note and you were kind enough to come and speak to me about it. I would just ask for 2 minutes time to respond to comments made by members of the Committee mentioning my name after I asked questions this morning. You have asked if I would wait until Senator Coburn returned to the Committee, and in deference to the respect to my colleague, I will do that. Senator LEAHY. Could I also, Mr. Chairman, on this— Chairman SPECTER. Well, I appreciate it very much, waiting for Senator Coburn.

ator Coburn, I want him here; otherwise, he will have something to say and you are not here.
Senator LEAHY. In fact— Senator DURBIN. He did already, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Now Senator Leahy is recognized into the lunch hour. Senator LEAHY. Into the lunch hour. Mr. Chairman, if I might, I came very close to objecting when Senator Coburn was speaking and referring to Senator Durbin. Senator Coburn is a new—he is a valued member of the Committee, of course but new, and I wanted to say that I have been here for 30 years. I have always made it a point, if I am going to raise something, to get word to the other party. I think it is a good way of doing it, and you have been totally fair in that. I would urge Senators, if they are going to start quoting each other, that maybe we have ‘‘quote time’’ or something like that. Senator Durbin is absolutely right in wanting to be able to respond to what was said. Chairman SPECTER. Well, I think that we might agree on best practice, but when you deal with Senators, my view is to give Senators great latitude as to what they want to undertake to do. And if Senator Coburn wants to make a comment without Senator Durbin here, I think that is going to be his call, although my preference would be to the contrary. But when Senator Durbin wants time to respond, I immediately sent word to him he would have the time that he requested. And then I sent for Senator Coburn. And Senator Coburn is in a meeting that he couldn’t leave, but we will get the two of you together fairly promptly. Senator DURBIN. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Lunchtime. [Whereupon, at 1:05 p.m., the Committee was adjourned, to reconvene at 2 p.m., this same day.] [AFTERNOON SESSION] Chairman SPECTER. The Committee will resume, and it is now Senator Biden’s turn for his second round for 20 minutes. Senator Biden? Senator BIDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge, good to see you. As I said to you—we happened to run into each other in the hallway coming in—what I would like to do, if I may, is go back and revisit two areas that you were questioned on yesterday, and a little bit maybe today. I do not recall actually. I think it was yesterday. One is the Casey case and I want to make sure I understand because I am still a little bit puzzled by your reasoning, but let me start off and make it clear. From my perspective, the abortion is a different—I am trying to figure out how you arrived at interpreting a Supreme Court Justice’s standard that was being applied, and how it came out differently than others. Yesterday you said when I think it was Senator Kohl asked you, that you agreed with Justice O’Connor, ‘‘that you look at the group that’s affected, not the group that’s unaffected.’’ But when you wrote your dissent, you said, and I quote, ‘‘It seems safe to assume that some percentage, despite an initial inclination not to tell their husbands, would notify their husbands

507
without suffering substantial ill effects, acknowledging some would suffer substantial ill effects.’’
Can you rationalize yesterday’s statement and your dissent for me? Explain it to me.
Judge ALITO. Well, I think what you look at is the group that is required to notify. You don’t look at the group that’s not required to notify, so unmarried women are not examined here because the notification requirement obviously does not apply to them.
Then my understanding of Justice O’Connor’s standard, which was the ‘‘more than some woman’’ standard, let me put it that way, although she didn’t put it quite that strongly. She said that it is insufficient that some women are inhibited from having an abortion as a result of the requirement. So you look at the people who are affected by—who are within the scope of the provision, and then you would see how many of the people within the scope of the provision would be inhibited from having an abortion as a result of what was involved. You don’t look at people who aren’t regulated at all, and you don’t just look at the people who would be inhibited because both of those would not be the right thing to look at.
So in the case of—let’s take the case of the informed consent requirement. You’d look at everybody who was required to receive the information that was within the informed consent provision, and then you would ask how many of the people, how many of the women who were regulated by this, would be inhibited from having an abortion as a result of the requirement. That was my understanding and that is my understanding of what she was talking about.
Senator BIDEN. You referenced in your dissent in Casey the Thornburgh case. What was the issue in Thornburgh?
Judge ALITO. Thornburgh concerned— Senator BIDEN. Excuse me. That prompted her to come up with the statement that you referenced, which was that it does not have to affect everyone? Judge ALITO. Well, she was setting our her understanding of what the standard was, of the Undue Burden Standard. Now, in Thornburgh there were several provisions of a previous version of the Pennsylvania statute at issue. There was an informed consent provision, as I recall. There was a provision relating to health insurance. There was a provision relating to notification of a minor’s parents. There were a number of provisions involved. And my recollection is that when she made the statement, she was talking about the Undue Burden Standard itself. It was an explanation of what she meant by the Undue Burden Standard. Senator BIDEN. As I went back and read it, my understanding was—and I will not, in the interest of time, read her entire two paragraphs here—but the part of Casey which she found to be a particular problem as being declared unconstitutional by her colleagues was where a doctor, an obstetrician would have to read to a woman certain verbiage that would explain the pros and cons about an abortion, or at least downsides of an abortion. And she said the State has an interest in promoting life, and so even though some women might be offended by that, it was still OK, it was still constitutional.

508
That language is the language that the discussion about even though some women would be affected, you transposed, in good conscience, to a case where notification to a husband was required. And one of the things that I had some difficulty with is whether or not there really were comparable issues here. In one case it was about whether or not a woman would fear for her life, for example, an exception was given, if she informed her husband. Another case, it was not about that that O’Connor was referring to, she was referring to about whether or not it put an undue burden on a woman to be told, ‘‘By the way, this can happen when you have an abortion, and this is the state the fetus is, et cetera.’’ And that is the part that kind of disturbs me, or that perplexes me anyway, about the real world here.
Senator Specter references the Violence Against Women Act. We did a lot of work on that. There is overwhelming evidence that there are women who would be fearful of going home and telling their husbands they are going to have an abortion, not fearful physically, fearful that the husband had all the economic power and said, ‘‘I am divorcing you and I am taking the kids and having a custody battle, and you don’t have the money to hire a lawyer.’’
Are they comparable ill effects? That is, that kind of ill effect on a woman that if she tells her husband, he is going to sue for divorce and seek custody of the children, knowing that he has all the economic horsepower and she has no ability to go out and hire a significant lawyer? Is that comparable to the doctor saying, ‘‘By the way, if you have an abortion, here is what happens?’’
Judge ALITO. No. The informed consent provision presented an easier—easier isn’t even the right word—a less difficult question than the spousal notification provision. I don’t think there’s any question about that. They both involved the same standard, which was the Undue Burden Standard. And therefore, I thought—and I still think that’s what’s said in reference to one provision is relevant in determining what the standard was.
The big issue, when this case was before us, was whether the standard was undue burden or not. It’s funny how cases look different after they’ve progressed through the Supreme Court than they do when they’re first presented to the court of appeals. That was the most hotly contested argument before us. Had there been any change in the Supreme Court’s case law—and the plaintiffs argued strenuously that there had not—but our panel, after some effort, determined under the Marks standard for determining what the holding of a case is when there’s no majority opinion, that the standard was the Undue Burden Standard. And there just wasn’t a lot to go on. I think I said that yesterday. I looked for whatever guidance I could find.
Senator BIDEN. Again, I am not questioning the sincerity of your search. Again, it gets down to the thing that keeps coming up with me, is not that you do not care about the little guy and all of that, that your reading of statutory language, Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution, seems to me to not reflect some of the genuine real-life differences that exist. The idea that you acknowledged that some women would suffer ill effects, substantial ill effects from informing their husbands, but because it was only a small percentage

509
that met the Undue Burden test, that did not meet the Undue Burden test, it seems to me—
Anyway, the majority disagreed with you, and I happen to disagree with you because I guess maybe it is because we have been so exposed to how so many women are within their relationships can suffer significant consequences for challenging a position that their husband does not want to accept, whether it has to do with abortion or what school their child goes to, and it is pretty consequential. But that is my problem with how you arrived at your reasoning—or your reasoning how you arrived at your conclusion.
Let me move on to another area in the interest of time here. Yesterday there was discussion about the Family and Medical Leave Act, and you correctly stated there were two distinct parts of the Act, and the Hibbs case dealt with one, and Chittister dealt with another. Can you explain that again for me?
Judge ALITO. Yes. Hibbs concerned a provision that required employers to give employees leave to be out of work to take care of a family member. And there was a record that employers, State employers had given more leave for this purpose to women than they had to men, and that was based on the stereotype that when somebody in the family gets sick and somebody has to leave work to take care of the family member, it’s the woman and not the man, and it reinforced the stereotype, of course, because having such a policy would encourage, would put pressure on women to leave for this purpose, as opposed to the man. If there was a woman and a man in the family, and somebody had to leave work to take care of a sick family member, and you have a plan like this, this is going to pressure the woman to do that. So the Hibbs court found that that was a sufficient record of gender discrimination to justify the passage of legislation under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment.
Chittister concerned a provision that related to leave for personal illness, and there’s no reason to think that men or women get sick more often one than the other, or what was to the point, that State employers had given men more sick time than women, or women more sick time than men. And so with that record, it was the conclusion of my court, and I believe seven other circuits, that this was a different issue. These cases were decided before and after Hibbs and that could not be justified if you accept the Congruence and Proportionality Standard.
Senator BIDEN. On the Congruence and Proportionality Standard, we in the Congress thought we were speaking to that because were you aware or your colleagues—speak for yourself, actually, you cannot speak for them—that one in four people taking sick leave under the Act are women for pregnancy-related disabilities? That we, when we wrote the law, we said explicitly that working women, we wanted the bill to protect working women from the dangers that pregnancy-based distinctions could be extended to limit their employment opportunities. I mean the practical world is that a fair number of women who are pregnant are told in the last— and I yield to my doctor at the end of the dais on the other side— but it is not unusual for a woman to be told that she needs to, the last month of pregnancy or 2 months of pregnancy, have bed rest. And if that counts against her 12 weeks, employers—we did establish there is a record where employers say, ‘‘Hey, look, man, we are

510
going to give men and women the same leave, notwithstanding the fact that women in fact in many circumstances—and one in four of them are pregnancy-related—need more time because of the pregnancy.’’ I mean was that discussed by you guys or women?
Judge ALITO. I’m quite certain it never was. I would have made a reference to it in the opinion if that had been mentioned. I am not aware of that coming up in the other circuit opinions on the issue. We are, to a degree—we can’t know everything about the real world, and we’re dependent on the arguments that are presented to us to a degree. I don’t believe that argument was ever presented.
Senator BIDEN. Congress expressly stated that the purpose of the Act was, quote, ‘‘to minimize the potential for employment discrimination by ensuring generally that leave is available for eligible medical reasons, including maternity-related disability.’’ That is why the decision confuses me. I think all you probably have to do is turn to your wife and say, ‘‘Hey, the real world, when you are pregnant does that sometime inhibit the amount of time you are required to be away from your job?’’ Fortunately, most women, like my wife and my daughter-in-law, work up to the time, but a lot cannot.
Let me suggest also, as I said to you in the hallway, I want to kind of set the record straight on Princeton. One of the reasons why I am perplexed and many of us are perplexed by your answers regarding the CAP, the organization, is that it does not fit with your background. As we both said in the hallway, I read your opening statement again, where you said that ‘‘a generation earlier I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton.’’ And I pointed out to you I am about 10 years older than you, that is how I felt. That was what I was referencing yesterday about my, you know, IrishCatholic kid from Claymont.
And the thing that surprises, or at least puzzles, me is that it was kind of, I thought, it was a pretty widely known debate that in the Ivies, the one sort of last holdout, fighting to not admit as many women and fighting not to admit as many minorities, was Princeton. There was a whole battle over it, as you heard referenced in terms of the Wall Street Journal and mailings to alumni.
And I noticed someone in the press. I want to be able to wear the hat given to me by pointing out that the reason I can wear this hat proudly today after being on campus as much as I have at Princeton is today, 28.7 percent of Princeton’s undergraduate population is minority, and today, the class of 2005, 47 percent—47 percent—are women. So that is what that battle was all about, a lot of us thought. I would be proud if my daughter were at Princeton Graduate School instead of Penn now, although I am very proud she is at Penn, but that is what this debate was about, Judge, and that is why it still confuses me.
I am going to ask you a straightforward question and I hope it doesn’t offend you. Did, when you listed CAP, was part of your rationale for listing it in an application you thought that would appeal to the outfit you were applying to, the people looking at your resume?

511
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, as I said, I don’t have a recollection of having anything to do with CAP, so all I can say is that I put it down on the ’85 form and therefore I must have been a member at around that time, and that’s—I can’t—
Senator BIDEN. I am not even suggesting about whether you were or were not remembering. Was part of the reason—I am looking for a reason. I am looking to be able to say—because you don’t impress me as someone, especially from your background, that would want to keep Princeton as—I won’t go back and read the quotes—keep Princeton as, you know, imagine my father’s 50th reunion, having 40 percent women, isn’t that awful. You don’t impress me as belonging to that club.
Judge ALITO. Well, I wasn’t. Senator BIDEN. So the only explanation I can think of—and you are not. You are a very informed guy. I mean, you are sitting up there in North Jersey as a U.S. Attorney. As I said, it is in the Wall Street Journal. It is a debate going on. You are getting letters. The only thing I could figure is you figured that a relatively conservative Reagan administration Justice Department would say, hey, maybe that is the kind of guy I want. I can’t understand why else you would put it down. But if that is not the reason, if you just listed the outfits you belong to, that still perplexes me, but anyway— Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I wasn’t a member of that club as you refer to it. By the time I entered Princeton, there were many minorities in my class. The practice of not including minorities had ended, and my class was not coeducational when we were admitted, and as I said yesterday, I had never previously attended a noncoeducational school— Senator BIDEN. You had about 300 women, if I am guessing right, when you got admitted, roughly. When were you admitted? Judge ALITO. I was admitted in 1968. It was not coeducational. It went coeducational while I was there— Senator BIDEN. In 1971, 1970–71, there were 300 women. Now, there are 2,100 in that same class. Anyway, I thank you very much, Judge. I yield the floor. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. We now have both Senator Durbin and Senator Coburn present. Senator Durbin, you have asked for 2 minutes as a matter of personal privilege. Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I will make it brief. Chairman SPECTER. You have 2 minutes. Senator DURBIN. In a courtroom and in a Committee room, it is not unusual to try to rehabilitate a witness. When hard questions are asked, people come back with information. Mr. Gillespie and his team are down there providing information, as are others. It is perfectly acceptable. We would do the same thing if the shoe were on the other foot. Two personal references to me were made after I left the room, and I apologize for leaving the Committee room. One related to the fact that I had earlier been in the pro-life position in my political life, and it is true. I made reference to this in my opening statement. I have stood for election more than 12 times in the House

and the Senate, general and primary, stating my position as prochoice, so the voters of Illinois know that.
I had asked Judge Alito whether his position had changed from 1985. That was the nature of my questions to you this morning. I don’t consider that to be a shortcoming if you would concede it changed, although at this point, you have not made that concession. Abraham Lincoln was once accused of changing his position on an issue and he said, I would rather be right some of the time than wrong all of the time, and so I don’t think changing your mind is necessarily condemnation.
The second point I would like to make specifically is my reference to settled law. Roe v. Wade is settled law, and I am sorry that Senator Hatch is not here at the moment, but I would like to read into the record exactly what was said on September 13, 2005, before this Committee when Senator Specter said, Judge Roberts—
Chairman SPECTER. Does this involve Senator Hatch, Senator Durbin?
Senator DURBIN. It does. Senator Hatch raised the question that I had said—
[Laughter.] Senator DURBIN [continuing]. That this position— Chairman SPECTER. Shouldn’t we have Senator Hatch here? Senator DURBIN. If you want to wait, I will wait. Chairman SPECTER. Yes, I would like to wait until Senator Hatch arrives. That way, we may be able to conclude this not in 2 minutes, but in less than 2 hours. I have made inquiries on the Rusher issue over the lunch hour, and I have some things to say about it, but I am not going to say them until Senator Kennedy arrives— [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. —so I have asked staff to inform Senator Kennedy that I await his arrival. In the meantime, if it pleases this august body, we will proceed with the hearing. Senator Kyl? Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do want to tie some loose ends up and one of them makes reference to something Senator Kennedy read. Would it be OK if I proceed with that? I think it would be fine. This has to do with this last matter that Senator Biden was also discussing and that is the Princeton alumni group. Just to make sure that the key facts are understood here, you believe you joined, Judge Alito, around 1985 because of a concerned threat to ROTC at Princeton University, is that correct? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I don’t recall joining, but I do remember that that was the issue relating to the administration that was bothering me for a period of time, including that period. Senator KYL. And just for the record, Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent to insert a quotation from the Princeton packet. I will just quote it here. Prospect editor Denise DeSouza added that CAP is concerned about the formation of a third-world center, a campaign to eliminate the Army ROTC program, and what it perceives as the decline of Princeton athletics. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.

513
Senator KYL. Second, on this matter, and I refer to this as the very scurrilous material read by Senator Kennedy, I suspect we would all agree was scurrilous material, had you ever heard of any of that material that he read a while ago before today?
Judge ALITO. No, Senator. Senator KYL. I believe you said you vehemently disagreed with it, is that correct? Judge ALITO. I do. I deplore those things. Senator KYL. And would disavow it? Judge ALITO. I disavow it. I would never associate myself with those things. Senator KYL. Did you know that such things had been published by the PAC when you were a member of it, or when you joined it? Judge ALITO. Absolutely not. I would never be a member of an organization that took those positions. Senator KYL. OK. And also, Mr. Chairman, unanimous consent for the record to contain the disclaimer which the editors of the Prospect include in the magazine. It reads, ‘‘The appearance of an article in Prospect does not necessarily represent an endorsement of the author’s beliefs by the Concerned Alumni of Princeton.’’ Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it, too, will be made a part of the record. Senator KYL. OK. Now let us return to your 15 years as a judge and how matters might come before you in the U.S. Supreme Court. I just wanted to also refer to something that I put in the record yesterday. It is a very difficult thing to look at 4,000 cases and conclude that, when you have ruled on both sides of issues depending upon different fact situations, as we have talked about before, that you necessarily favor one side or the other. One of the areas of concern was in the area of discrimination. I just want to read one sentence of what I inserted in the record yesterday regarding employment discrimination and see if you have any other comment on it. A 2003 study of employment discrimination claims in Federal court found that Federal appeals court judges sided with employment discrimination plaintiffs in only 13 percent of the cases. Judge Alito’s record of four out of 18, or 22 percent, is actually more favorable to plaintiffs. Do you know that to be incorrect or do you have any other comment on it? Judge ALITO. I don’t know—I’m not familiar with the statistics. The way the appeals system is set up, the types of—I think that’s what results in the statistics that you mentioned, the low rate of success for plaintiffs, because these cases are generally cases in which summary judgment has been granted for the defendant. If the district court denies summary judgment for the defendant, then the case will go to trial and very often is settled, or there’s a trial and then there’s no appeal after the trial. So the cases that we get, most of the cases that we get are cases that have been looked at by a conscientious district judge and found not to be cases that should go to trial and I think that’s what produces those statistics. Senator KYL. And that’s an interesting lesson, I think, for all of us, to be able to explain why certain cases come to courts and why they would be more on one side than the other. It is an important lesson, I think, both for lawyers and non-lawyers to appreciate that

kind of dynamic, because otherwise, if you just look at raw statistics and don’t know the background, you could come to different conclusions. So I appreciate that.
In another area, it is apparent to me that you are simply not going to be able to satisfy some of my colleagues because you will not absolutely commit to rule the way that they want to on a couple of key issues, for example, on the issue of abortion. You have repeatedly confirmed the significance in the role of precedent, in this case, Roe v. Wade. You also noted situations in which, as a Third Circuit Court judge, you adhered to the Roe v. Wade precedent.
But you have declined to announce your constitutional view of Roe today, despite repeated attempts by some of my colleagues to get you to do it in these hearings. Implied in your answer is the point that to do that here would commit you to a particular result, something you cannot ethically do. Are there cases regarding abortion that you believe may come before the U.S. Supreme Court?
Judge ALITO. There certainly are cases that may come before the Supreme Court. There is a case involving abortion before the Court this term, and they come up with some regularity. Many of them involve the application of Roe. Most of them involve the application of Roe or the application of other precedents that build on Roe. But it is entirely possible that a case involving Roe itself could come up at some point in the future.
Senator KYL. Now, I said in my opening statement that I would defend your right to decline to say in advance how you would rule on matters that could come before you, but kind of along the same lines that you did a moment ago, perhaps you could tell us the reason for the rule, in other words, to elaborate on the damage that would be done if judges indicate in advance how they might rule on cases. What is the reason for that rule?
Judge ALITO. In my mind, the most important reason is that to do that would undermine the entire judicial decisionmaking process. We have a process for deciding legal issues and it is critically important that we stick to that process, and that means that when an issue comes before us, the briefs are not a formality. The arguments of the attorneys are not a formality. We should read those very carefully and we should study the issue and we should study all the authorities that are cited to us and carefully consider all of the arguments that are presented to us, both in the briefs and in the attorneys’ oral presentation, and then go into the conference and discuss the case among the members of the court, and we shouldn’t decide legal questions without questions that are going to—not just abstract questions as if we were in a constitutional law seminar, but cases that are going to have an impact on the real world. We shouldn’t decide those questions even in our own minds without going through that whole process.
If we announce—if a judge or a judicial nominee announced before even reading the briefs or getting the case or hearing the argument what he or she thought about the ultimate legal issue, all of that would be rendered meaningless and people would lose all their respect for the judicial system, and with justification, because that is not the way in which members of the judiciary are supposed to go about the work of deciding cases.

Senator KYL. I have talked about this image we have of Lady Justice, the blind figure with the scales of justice in her hand, and try to describe why she has the blindfold across her eyes. I just marvel at our judicial system, and having represented clients in court for 20 years myself, how we in America are willing to literally put our lives sometimes, certainly our freedom and our fortune, in the hands of a person, one judge frequently, sometimes a jury, sometimes not, sometimes more than one judge, but frequently a judge. How would people possibly have the trust to put everything they own, or their own freedom, in the hands of a person if we as a country hadn’t established over 200 years of adhering to this rule of law, this notion that justice is blind, that the facts of your case and the law will decide whether you win or lose and nothing else?
It is a remarkable phenomenon, if you stop to think about it, and not all countries do that, and even countries that have judicial systems, I don’t think one can have near the confidence in that we do here in the United States. So it is a critical, critical principle that plays itself out in courtrooms around this country every day and it is something that I think we have to fight to preserve as much as we possibly can, and I appreciate your explanation of that.
Just a couple of final things and I am going to be able to yield back some of my time. I just can’t resist pointing out one little irony here and it has to do with the precedent that I spoke of before, Roe v. Wade, that is so important to several members of this Committee. It was written by a Justice who himself was, at least in some cases, willing to throw off precedent. Do you remember who wrote the opinion in Roe v. Wade?
Judge ALITO. It was Justice Blackman. Senator KYL. Justice Blackman, and in, one might say, an infamous 1994 dissent from a denial of cert in the case of Collins v. Collins, Justice Blackman wrote that he would refuse to follow all Supreme Court precedent on the death penalty, which has been ruled constitutional by the Court, of course, by saying that he would, and I quote, ‘‘no longer tinker with the machinery of death,’’ end of quote. I suspect that is not the way to deal with precedent. If you have a comment on it, fine, but again, I just think it ironic that the decision perhaps most in focus here was authored by a judge who himself was quite willing to throw off precedent, I would argue in a rather cavalier way, in a situation in which he didn’t like it. Let me just close by putting something in the record and making a comment. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert the following statement in the record, but I would like to read it because it is a statement of the Majority Leader of the Senate, Bill Frist. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record. Senator KYL. And let me briefly read it. ‘‘As a Princeton alumnus, I had concerns about CAP, but I have no concerns about Judge Alito’s credibility, integrity, and his commitment to protecting the equal rights of all Americans. Judge Alito has condemned discrimination, and his record of more than 15 years demonstrates his commitment to equal rights for women and minorities.

‘‘Old documents of a now-defunct organization will not tell us more than Alito’s statements and record already have. Further, the views that the Democrats attribute to Alito through CAP were the views expressed by an individual member in a magazine, who was not speaking for the organization and certainly not for Judge Alito. This is another transparent attempt by Democrats to wage an unfair smear campaign against an exceptionally qualified nominee.’’
Mr. Chairman, I read that not to attribute the views to any member of this committee, but I think it is important that the reputation of this fine jurist be based upon his actions as a jurist for over 15 years, as I said in my opening statement—longer than any other justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, except for one, 70 years ago, on a circuit court of appeals—with a record of over 4,000 decisions and an ample opportunity to know what kind of a person he is, what kind of a judge he has been, and, I would argue, what kind of a judge that he would make.
I do not believe that his answers to questions have been inconsistent or unforthcoming. I believe that, as a matter of fact, Judge, you have been very forthcoming in your answers to questions, including getting right up to the edge on a lot of matters that arguably could come before the Court. But you did not try to dodge or duck those questions at all. In fact, let me just read for the record two or three statements relating to your performance here at this hearing, if I could, please.
Well, Senator Biden isn’t here, so I won’t read what he has said. But it is on the chart. And I appreciate what he said, by the way.
Jill Zuckman, who writes for the Chicago Tribune: ‘‘Judge Alito has gone farther and I think that has given a lot more substance to these hearings, said Specter—meaning our distinguished chairman, Arlen Specter.’’
And then, Dana Milbank, writing in the Washington Post: ‘‘Unlike John G. Roberts, Jr., who made frequent attempts to soften his views and dodge many of the questions, Alito took almost every question.’’
I am not going to subscribe to the first part of that last quotation with respect to Judge Roberts, but I think it is true that you have taken the questions, you have answered them to the best of your ability, and you have only stopped short when not to do so would be to commit to a decision in a case that you are not ethically permitted to do and that would do injustice to the rule of law and the parties that might come before the Court.
So I want to commend you for being so forthcoming, for answering our questions, and for testifying in a very thoughtful, and as has been apparent to everybody, without any notes or materials or referring to any other people here, with great knowledge about both the matters on which you have worked and the law generally.
Thank you, Judge. Judge ALITO. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Kyl. Senator Kohl. Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, after the first day of questions, it seems very clear that you believe there are certain bedrock principles in American constitutional law, principles like the right of one man, one vote in

redistricting, the right of children not to have to go to schools unless they are integrated schools, the right for people to have privacy in making decisions about contraception, and other rights.
Even though these are cases where the principles are raised and their application is debated on the margins or even more fundamentally, I believe you have said and you are willing to say that you will not question the underlying principle involved on these issues. And I commend you for that. We are assured, and I believe, that you clearly do stand by those principles.
And yet, when you are asked about Roe v. Wade and the following case of Casey, cases that say the Government should not place an undue burden on a woman’s right to choose, when we ask about principles of that sort, you are unwilling to make the same statement of support.
Now, I understand that there will be cases where plaintiffs argue on the margins about Roe and Casey, where there are efforts to narrow or broaden these principles, just as there are cases that narrow or broaden the principles of one man, one vote or the issue enunciated in Brown v. Board of Education or Griswold. But you are willing to stand by those other legal principles and yet you are not taking the same position with regard to the principles embodied in Roe and Casey.
Could you explain that, please? Judge ALITO. Senator, I think it’s important to draw a distinction between issues that could realistically come up before the courts and issues that are very much, that are still very much in play— which is to say, the subject of litigation in the courts. And I felt comfortable about commenting on one person, one vote and, of course, Brown v. Board of Education because those are not issues that are any longer the subject of litigation in our country, not the fundamental principles that are embodied in those decisions. And the Griswold case, likewise, concerns an issue that is not realistically likely to come before the courts. Roe, on the other hand, involves an issue that is involved in a considerable amount of litigation before the courts, and so that’s where I feel that I must draw the line, because on issues that could realistically come up, it would be improper for me to express a view and I would not reach a conclusion regarding any issue like that before going through the whole judicial process that I described. Senator KOHL. I think there is strength to what you say, but I also believe it is not inaccurate to say that these other issues on the margins, just as Roe on the margins, are still coming up and may yet come up before the Court. And I still feel that while you are prepared to take a position on these other issues which is almost bottom-line, clearly bottom-line, you are not prepared to take that same position—which you could, if you wished; you could take that position if you wished. And I think what that does suggest is that what you are saying is that it is possible, if a case comes before you, that you would take a look at the principles underlying Roe and Casey and see them in a way that would overturn Roe and Casey. Now, you may say, well, obviously the answer is yes. But I just want to get that clarified for the record.

Judge ALITO. Well, what I would do if a case like that were to come before me, and if I’m confirmed, is to follow the two-step process that I’ve talked about, which is first to consider the issue of stare decisis. And there’s been a considerable body of case law now on this issue going back to Roe and, in particular over the last 20 years, and in the Casey opinion, that was where the joint opinion began and the joint opinion ended. And then only if I got beyond that issue would I consider the underlying issue. And that’s what I would do if the issue were to come up. And I don’t believe that it would be appropriate and it wouldn’t even be realistic for me to go further than that.
Senator KOHL. That is correct. And in your mind, you are not prepared to say that the principle embodied in Roe v. Wade and the principle embodied in Casey is clearly established law that is not subject, to your mind, to review. You are not prepared—I mean, that is not your position, which I think you have said. But I think, at least for me, a clarification of that would be of some importance.
Judge ALITO. Well, in light of the current state of litigation relating to the issue of abortion—and as I said, there’s an abortion case before the Supreme Court this term and there are undoubtedly abortion cases before the lower Federal courts; I know there are— I don’t believe that it’s appropriate for me to go further than that in relation to that issue.
Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Alito, the President nominated you for the Supreme Court because of your record as a person and as a judge. Groups and individuals, particularly on the right, quickly endorsed you soon after your nomination because they feel comfortable with your record as you have established it over several decades now, where you have come from, and where you are on the issues that are important to them. We also assume that you yourself are very proud of your record, as you should be. As a man of principle and conviction, which we believe you are, you worked on issues throughout your career as a Justice Department attorney that you believed in, that you cared about, that mattered to you. And I am certain you would say that if you didn’t believe in these things, you would not have gone to work for that particular Justice Department under that particular administration. And yet yesterday during the hearing, you seemed to walk away from a lot of your record. For example, when asked about an interview where you supported Judge Bork, calling him ‘‘one of the most outstanding nominees of this century,’’ you answered that you were just supporting the administration’s position, that that wasn’t your position. And even then, you distanced yourself from a number of his views, after having said that he was one of the most outstanding nominees of this century. You are a man of conviction; I am sure you are. And you are not just a mouthpiece for people. You never have been and you never will be—which is to your credit. When asked about the strong position you took opposing a woman’s right to choose in your job application, you said that only reflected how you felt then and did not suggest anything of what you believe now. What you felt then you felt as a full-grown man, and you are saying that is not necessarily how you feel now.

When asked about your membership in a radical organization at Princeton, a group that you cited with pride on your job application, you said that you could not remember anything about the group at all.
When asked about the citation on your job application where you refer to the importance of traditional values, and what you meant by traditional values, then you answered, somewhat incomprehensibly, when you said that you were protecting children from ‘‘psychological threats that come from elements in the atmosphere is a traditional value.’’
I also asked you about your statement on your job application that you disagreed with the Warren Court’s rulings on reapportionment, rulings that stand for the basic principle of one person, one vote. Indeed, you said your disagreement was so strong that it contributed to your decision to pursue a legal career. Yesterday you stated that you in fact did not disagree with the principle of one person, one vote—not then, not now.
So, Judge, this is the only time that the people of this country are going to have an opportunity to get a sense of who you are, what you believe in, what you stand for, who you are as a person. I think you would say that the American people have the absolute right to know that, without condition, without any political considerations, that the most important part of this hearing is that the American people get a chance, through our questions and your answers, to know who you really are. I would like to hope that you would say the job isn’t worth it if we can’t do that and do that well. And I believe you believe that.
So I would like to ask you how you bring into a sense of harmony some of these things that you have done and said throughout your career which have brought you to this situation in which you are now, a person being nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, and some of the positions which you have taken in the last few days which, in effect, distance you from some of the very things that you have done and stood for over a career that bring you to where you are today.
Judge ALITO. Senator, you mentioned a number of things and I’ve tried to jot them down so that I could cover at least the major things that you mentioned.
You mentioned—and I guess I’ll take these in reverse order of chronology—you mentioned the statement in the 1985 statement relating to reapportionment. And I’ve tried to explain what I had in mind. The statement in the ’85 statement talked about what I thought about reapportionment when I was in college. And the reason why I mentioned that—why would I mention what I thought about constitutional law in college before I’d even been to law school?
What I was attempting to do was to explain the development of my thinking about the role of the judiciary and about constitutional law and, in particular my development of my strong belief in judicial self-restraint. And the first place in which I saw a theoretical explanation of that doctrine, which I found persuasive at the time, was Alexander’s Bickel’s book, ‘‘The Supreme Court and the Idea of Progress,’’ which came out during the time when I was in college. I think it was the first book about constitutional theory, so

to speak, that I had read. And he addressed the issue of one person, one vote, and that linked up in my mind with the experiences of my father in working on the reapportionment of the New Jersey legislature.
And at the time when I was in college, there was an issue that was very much a live issue at the time as to what one person, one vote meant. Did it mean that you took this principle of one person, one vote and applied it with blinding literalness so that every district was exactly equal in population, or very close to that, with a population deviation of under 1 percent, or could other factors that people thought were legitimate factors to be considered in drawing districts, such as respecting county lines and municipal lines; was it permissible to take those into account? That’s what I know I was thinking about reapportionment back in my college days.
I referred in the statement to traditional values, and I said yesterday at this point in 2006, I can’t say for sure exactly what was on my mind in 1985, when I made reference to traditional values. But I tried to describe some of the things that I probably thought were traditional—thought of as traditional values, and I listed a number of them. One—and a lot of them had to do with the ability of people to live and raise a family in the sort of neighborhood where I grew up. And I gave a little description of that earlier.
So it would include things like being able to live in peace and safety. I think that’s a traditional value, and that was very much at stake when I was in college in the late ’60s and early ’70s and in 1985, because these were eras of high crime. And a lot of the work that I had done up to 1985 as an assistant U.S. attorney and working on criminal cases in the Solicitor General’s Office seemed to me to be involved with this issue of protecting people from the threat of crime.
I think I mentioned the ability to raise children the way you want, to instill your values, not to have them subject to certain external threats. And these were—you know, I’ve tried to think of why would these have been at issue in the mid-80s. And they were at issue because of things like some of the things I was referring to earlier today about children being able to, and students being able to express their religious views at school in a nondiscriminatory way, so that religious speech was not discriminated against. And that was very much at issue in the ’80s. Congress passed the Equal Access Act at about that time to embody that principle.
So those were some of the things that came to my mind as traditional values.
The 1985 statement in reference to abortion, I have not distanced myself from it. I have said that that was a correct expression of what I thought in 1985 when I wrote it. It was written in 1985, and that was 20 years ago. And there’s been a lot of case law in the intervening years. There was Thornburgh and there was Webster and Casey, all of which involved direct challenges to Roe, and there were other cases applying Roe.
So that’s what I had in mind with respect to the matters that you’ve covered.
Senator KOHL. Last question. When we met privately, I asked you what sort of Supreme Court Justice you would make and your

521
answer was fair when you said if you want to know what sort of justice I would make, look at the sort of judge that I have been.
Last week, the Washington Post did exactly that in an analysis of your record as a Third Circuit judge for the past 15 years. They analyzed 221 cases that you sat on and in which the court’s decision was divided. I recognize that in every case there is a difference and that it must be decided on its facts. Nonetheless, this data reveals patterns and tendencies in your decisions, among other things, as you may have recollected from the Post article.
It was found that in civil rights cases you sided against three out of every four people who claimed to have been victims of discrimination. This was a significantly greater rate than other judges in a national sample of cases. Of 33 criminal cases the newspaper analyzed, you sided with the criminal defendant only three times. This was a very much lower rate than the national sample. In immigration cases, the Post also found that you sided with immigrants who were trying to win asylum or block deportation only in one out of eight cases analyzed. This was much less than most judges in the national sample.
Now, the Washington Post was not the only one to perform an analysis of your record. Noted constitutional law professor Cass Sunstein, for example, found that, ‘‘When there is a conflict between institutions and individual rights, Judge Alito’s dissenting opinions argue against individual rights 84 percent of the time.’’
So what can we glean from these analyses of Judge Alito and what might they indicate with respect to your posture on cases should you become a Justice of the Supreme Court?
Judge ALITO. On the discrimination cases, Senator, I think that the statistic that Senator Kyl just cited speaks directly to that, a comparison of the number of times in which people claiming discrimination prevailed in the cases won my vote compared to the average for circuit judges in general. And I think that those statistics—that my statistics and the statistics for circuit judges in general have to be viewed against the background of—have to be viewed with a recognition of the way in which these discrimination cases come up through the court system. Most of them are cases in which the person claiming the violation lost in the district court, and that means that a district court judge—and they are not always right, but most of the time they are right. And they are conscientious people, and they apply the same law that we do. They found that these were not meritorious cases. And so if you start out with a group of cases that have already been found to be not meritorious, it stands to reason that probably not a very high percentage of them will ultimately be found to be meritorious.
On the immigration cases, I take very seriously—and I don’t know what the statistics are in this area, but I can tell you this, that I take very seriously the scope of review that I am supposed to perform as an appellate judge. And that is usually dictated by Congress, and in the area of immigration, Congress has spoken clearly. And as to factual decisions that are made by an immigration judge, what Congress has told us is you are not to disturb those unless no reasonable fact finder could have reached the conclusion that the immigration judge did. And I very often see a record where I think it’s doubtful. I say to myself, ‘‘I might have

522
decided this differently if I were the immigration judge.’’ But I wasn’t there. I didn’t see the witnesses testify personally. And Congress has told me what my role is there. My role is not to substitute my judgment for that of the immigration judge. My job is to say, Could a reasonable person have reached the conclusion that the immigration judge did? And if I find that a reasonable person could have reached that conclusion, then it’s my job to deny the petition for review. And that’s what I do in those instances.
Senator KOHL. I appreciate that. I would just comment again that your siding with immigrants who were trying to win asylum or block deportation, you sided only in one out of eight cases that they analyzed, and this was much less than most judges in a national sample who are about evenly divided in their decisions on these issues. This was what their analysis indicated.
So, you know, for whatever it is worth, you were one out of eight; in the national sample of judges, it was about 50 percent. I only bring that up for your comment.
I thank you very much, Judge Alito, and, Mr. Chairman, I thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kohl. We have made some inquiries about the issue which Senator Kennedy has raised about the Concerned Alumni of Princeton. As to the letter, I am advised by my chief of staff, Michael O’Neill, that he first saw a computer letter and that he believes later a letter was delivered to the Judiciary Committee headquarters, apparently near Christmas, perhaps on Christmas Eve, and our custom is to log letters in, and the letter was never logged in. But I repeat and confirm that I have never seen this letter until I saw a computer printout of it about an hour ago. Mr. O’Neill did talk to me about it over the break between Christmas and New Year’s. I traveled to Iraq. That is the first time on the Judiciary Committee schedule I could find a few days to get away, and Mr. O’Neill reminds me that we talked about it on the phone, and I thought the matter was unmeritorious, not worthy of the time of the Committee, based on all that I knew about it. A very brief conversation. We get so many requests and there are so many items that are largely staff-driven—not that staff-driven matters aren’t important, but if something is of significance, you customarily expect a member to tell you about it. Senator Kennedy and I frequent the gym at the same time and talk all the time, and he never mentioned it to me, nor did he take it to the Ranking Member. I make it a point that Senator Leahy’s calls are the first ones I return, and I have a fair number, but I return all calls from Members very, very promptly. And had this matter been presented to me, I would have given it more attention than I did on that telephone call that I have referred to. So much for matters which are not quite as relevant as what I am about to come to. The New York Times published a story about this on November 26th, and my chief of staff, William Reynolds, talked to David Kirkpatrick, who said he had gone through all of the records. And as the story in the public domain stated, these are the records that the Library of Congress, the Rusher records, those

523
records and others at the med. library at Princeton give no indication that Judge Alito was among the group’s major donors. He was not an active leader of the group, and two of his classmates who were involved and Mr. Rusher said they did not remember his playing a role.
Well, the obvious thing to do is to call Mr. Rusher, which Mr. O’Neill did over the lunch hour, and Mr. Rusher said he would be glad to have us look at his record, and that he had received a request from Congressional Research Service, but it was from an unnamed requester, and he declined. But he said had he received a request from Senator Kennedy or some member of this Committee, he would have made the records available. So in Senator Kennedy’s absence, I asked a staffer to tell him that we had moved ahead, but I didn’t want to waste any time, and Mr. O’Neill has contacted Senator Kennedy’s staffers, and they are en route or at the Library of Congress to look at these records so that we can confirm what the New York Times’ David Kirkpatrick has had to say.
I am just a little puzzled at the issue being raised in this manner. We talk all the time, and I am just a little surprised that Senator Kennedy hadn’t talked to Senator Leahy or hadn’t talked to me before he made a request for access to the Rusher records, talks about a subpoena, talks about a ruling of the Chair, talks about overruling the Chair. Just a little puzzled. But the substantive matters are being attended to. And I share Senator Kennedy’s concern that we have all the facts. All the facts. All the facts. And this is a lifetime appointment. It is a matter of tremendous importance, and I wouldn’t want to find on some occasion that something comes to light which would bear on this nomination that we could have found out had we been more vigilant.
Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome the fact that we are going to have the access to those records. The fact remains I didn’t anticipate—I thought that since this was a major issue on the 1985 application of the nominee for a new job, this membership with the Federalist Society and the CAP organization, I thought as a matter of routine that we would have access to those records. And it was a letter to you, as we would do, and would followup with the staff, which is the usual procedure here. I regret I have not been down in the gym since before Christmas so I have missed you down there. But the important fact is we are going to get that information. I think that is what is extremely important. And, quite frankly, if we had been able to get what I think were more responsive answers by the nominee during the course of the exchange today, I don’t think it would have even been necessary. But I don’t think you would be able to look through the transcript on the exchanges that we had with the nominee and not feel that we have an important responsibility to followup. So I am grateful that we will have that chance to followup, and I look forward to the further considerations and evaluation of the material and further considerations of the hearing. Chairman SPECTER. Enough said. Senator Leahy, you have a unanimous consent request?

Senator LEAHY. Yes, Mr. Chairman. As I had understood, we will be going back to another round, so if I have misunderstood, you will correct me. But as I understood Judge Alito, he saw no connection between his unified Executive theory and the use of Presidential signing statements. In fact, the Wall Street Journal reported the President has cited the unitary Executive 103 times in Presidential signing statements. So I would like to put that article and some articles from the Post that are relevant in the record. In fact, in the defense bill, the McCain torture amendment, he specifically employed a signing statement mentioning the unitary Executive, and I would like to make that part of the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, those documents will be made a part of the record.
Senator DeWine, 20 minutes. Senator DEWINE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge, yesterday you and I discussed the concerns that I have about the Supreme Court’s willingness to strike down law passed by this Congress and by State legislators. This lack of what I consider to be appropriate deference by the Court endangers our ability to protect the rights of our citizens. One of the groups that I am most concerned about in that context is people with disabilities. Congress has passed a number of laws to assure that people with disabilities have equal access and equal opportunities. I think it is critically important that we make sure that those with disabilities have these opportunities to participate fully in our society in every way possible. As you know, Judge, the Americans with Disabilities Act was a landmark piece of legislation passed by this Congress in our ongoing efforts to assure that people with disabilities are treated fairly. The 1999 case of Olmstead v. L.C. was an important Supreme Court case interpreting this law. As you know, Olmstead held that Title II of the ADA requires States to serve individuals with disabilities in community settings whenever possible, instead of segregating them while providing them with care. Olmstead was decided after the case of Helen L. v. DiDario, a case which, of course, you are familiar with, a Third Circuit case, that reached essentially the same conclusion. Although you were not on the Helen L. panel, you along with four other judges voted to rehear the case en banc. So let me ask you, Judge, if you could, to discuss with us your reasoning behind voting to rehear the Helen L. case. I would like to ask you, did that vote to rehear the case mean that you thought that the Helen L. case was decided incorrectly or that you opposed the later holding in Olmstead? Let me also ask you, now that Olmstead has been decided, do your reasons for voting to rehear the Helen L. case still apply? And do you have any concerns with the Supreme Court’s holding in Olmstead that would cause you to question the validity of that particular decision? Judge ALITO. I certainly don’t have any concerns about the decision in Olmstead. I would have to look at my own file in the Helen L. case—and I doubt that there is any file in the case at this point—to try and see if there’s anything in there to indicate specifically why I voted for rehearing in the case. And perhaps if—but I can say this: that I read the decision again, and one important part
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00536 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

525
of the opinion in the case attempts to distinguish an earlier Third Circuit case that seemed to be somewhat closely related—closely related to the issue that was at hand. And I noted there were five votes for rehearing in the case, and that’s quite unusual. It’s unusual for there to be that many votes for rehearing.
Most of the time—I would say most of the time when we vote for rehearing, the reason is because we think that there may be an inconsistency in our court case law, and that doesn’t necessarily mean that we think that the decision we’re voting to rehear was incorrect. Quite often, we think the decision that we are voting to reconsider is correct, but that it is inconsistent with a prior case that needs to be overruled, and we are very scrupulous about following our own precedents, not ignoring them. So if we have a precedent out there and it seems to us to be wrong and the issue comes up in a later case, then our mechanism is to vote to rehear.
That happens very often, and my guess, based on what I can tell just from reading the opinion and looking at the votes for rehearing and the judges who voted for rehearing, is that could have been what was going on.
Senator DEWINE. I appreciate your answer, Judge. As the Chair of this Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, I have seen that it is often very hard to draw the line between anticompetitive conduct and, frankly, just good old-fashioned competition. Let me give you an example that Senator Kohl and I have done a great deal of work on, and, frankly, Senator Kohl has really taken a lead on. Many hospitals buy their supplies through group purchasing organizations, known as GPOs. These organizations purchase products for a large number of hospitals at one time, which decreases prices, but also gives them extraordinary power over which products get used and which ones don’t get used. Often, GPOs reach deals with major suppliers to buy items in bundles; in other words, buy a number of different products from those suppliers in order to get discounts on all the products. It saves money, but it also means that smaller companies, which many only offer one of these products, have really a hard time competing with the large discounts being offered. The result is that smaller companies have difficulty getting into the market even if their one specific product may be better or it may even be cheaper. Judge, you had a case that dealt with bundling like this. It was the 3M v. LePage case. In that case, 3M, which sells Scotch tape, was selling it as part of a bundle with other products. The result was that LePage, which was offering a cheaper competing tape, was having a hard time getting stores to sell its tape because if the stores then did, they would have to give up the chance to save money on all the other 3M products that they carried. The majority ruled against 3M, but you dissented. I wonder if you could please explain your reasoning behind that dissent and explain what type of bundle discounts you think would violate the antitrust laws. Judge ALITO. Well, let me preface what I’m going to say by saying that I’m not an antitrust expert and so I plod my way through these antitrust issues when they come up. But this was a tough one and it was a monopolization case and it required an examination of all the factors that were relevant to a determination of whether 3M was engaging in monopolization.

526
3M was selling the product, as I recall, it was selling these products—it was not selling them below its cost. It was selling them above its cost, but 3M was—because of its scale or because it was more efficient, was able to produce its product more cheaply. I remember looking at the authorities that had discussed this and the writing of leading antitrust experts on bundling issues and that factor, taken together with the other factors in the case, persuaded Judge Greenberg and I, and we were the majority on the case at the panel level, that there wasn’t sufficient evidence of monopolization here. And then when the case went en banc, the court as a whole came out the other way.
But my understanding of the state of the scholarship on this issue right now and on the way economists view the issue is that I believe that, or many of them who believe that this is—a situation like this is not—does not involve monopolization. This is not a way in which a company like that can engage in a predatory practice over a period of time. But there is uncertainty, really, about how the monopolization standard applies to issues of bundling. So I think it’s quite up in the air, and should it come up again, I think it merits reexamination.
Senator DEWINE. Thank you, Judge. Judge, you have heard a lot of discussion and many of us have said that we don’t like it when judges legislate from the bench. For judges to properly perform their function, obviously, it is crucial that they attempt to put their own policy preferences aside in the cases before them. But it seems to me that this is a lot easier said than done.
Our Constitution is not a dictionary. It contains a number of very broad, undefined phrases. Let me give you some examples. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. The 14th Amendment says that the State shall not deprive any person of liberty without due process of law. The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishments. I am sure you could supply a lot more examples than I am.
When confronted with such broad phrases, like ‘‘unreasonable’’ or ‘‘liberty,’’ ‘‘cruel and unusual,’’ how do you know whether you are making policy or merely interpreting the Constitution itself? What tools will you use as a Supreme Court Justice to ensure that your personal views do not play a role in your decisionmaking?
Judge ALITO. In all the areas that you mentioned, there is now a considerable body of case law, and that is a real limitation on the exercise of judicial power. That is one of the important reasons for the doctrine of stare decisis. In the 78th Federalist Paper, when Alexander Hamilton was responding to the people who were worried about this power of judicial review, who thought that it would give the judiciary too much power, he specifically cited the fact that members of the judiciary would be bound up by precedent and this would restrain them. This would keep them from injecting their own views into the decisionmaking process.
Under the Fourth Amendment, there is an enormous body of case law now and there are many types of searches that are—it’s established in case law that a warrant is required. There are types of searches where it’s established now that the activity can be conducted with reasonable suspicion, a Terry stop, for example, other types of searches require probable cause. And there are many spe-

cialized types of searches, administrative searches, roadblocks constructed for certain purposes, border searches, and so forth.
Under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment, there is a great body of case law on procedural due process and most of the due process issues involve procedural due process, what sort of process is required. There is a standard for cases involving the substantive component of that.
Under the Eighth Amendment, since the Supreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia ruled that the death penalty is permissible under certain circumstances, there is a very large body and a complex body of case law within which a judge would work in deciding cases in that field.
Senator DEWINE. Judge, let me turn to an area that I talked with Judge Roberts about, and that is free speech in the public square. To me, there is perhaps no right in our Constitution that is really as important as freedom of speech. The heart of the First Amendment is the idea that people have a right to speak their mind but also be heard on matters of public concern. Traditionally, our citizens have expressed their opinion on public issues by turning to the public square. They do it in parks, streets, sidewalks, anywhere that people gather. It is as old as the country—older than our country.
Lately, however, I believe that we are seeing a disturbing trend. In many cases, governments have sought to restrict speech in the public arena, sometimes with success, sometimes without. Let me give you some examples. In one recent case, a Wisconsin woman was kicked off a city bus when she tried to distribute a book containing Bible stories to individuals sitting next to her. In many towns and cities across the country, individuals are prohibited from placing political signs on their own property. They are told what size they can put out. They are told the times they can put it out, the dates they can put it out, et cetera. In many public places, individuals have been forced to hold up signs of protest and been confined to ‘‘free speech zones,’’ far away from the event that they wish to protest. These individuals are doing nothing more, many times, than just standing their with their sign.
These sorts of restrictions concern me because they limit the ability of individuals not only to speak, but also to be heard in public places, people who want to talk about politics, religion, or any other matter of public concern. I think we need to be careful as a society before we limit what people can say and where they can say it.
Let me ask you, how do you approach challenges to government restrictions on the ability of individuals to speak and be heard in public places, and what, Judge, factors do you consider when deciding which restrictions on speech in the public square are proper under the First Amendment and which ones are not?
Judge ALITO. I think that freedom of speech and freedom of the press and all the freedoms set out in the First Amendment are matters of the utmost importance. Freedom of speech is not only important for its own said, but it is vital to the preservation of our form of government, and I think that if anybody reviews that opinions that I’ve written in the area of freedom of expression and other First Amendment—

Senator DEWINE. I have looked at some of them, at least— Judge ALITO. —they will see that I strongly support those rights. The issue of speech in particular places is a daunting issue. The Supreme Court has addressed it by developing the forum doctrine, and they have identified what they call a public forum, which would be something like a public street, where people’s ability to speak is at the maximum. At the other extreme, there is a private forum. My chambers would be a private forum. A Senator’s office would be a private forum. Someone would not have a right to come in from the street and speak in a place like that. And then there are what they call limited public forums or dedicated public forums or fora, places where people can speak freely, but only at particular times on particular subjects, a place that is dedicated to free speech but only on a particular subject, for example. That is the way they analyze it. Now, some people would say that there are developments in society that have resulted in the shrinking of public fora that make it more difficult for people to express themselves. I know that I’m not up to date on New Jersey case law under the New Jersey Constitution, but it’s my belief that our State has read this—has a different forum doctrine in things like shopping centers. Malls that are privately owned are considered to be public fora under a New Jersey State law. I think some other States view it that way and that’s a competing way of looking at this problem. An important principle where I have dealt with this in my cases, as I can recall, is the issue of freedom of speech in a limited public forum, and even in a limited public forum, what government cannot do is engage in viewpoint discrimination. If the government opens up a particular forum for discussion of a particular subject, it can’t say, but we’re not going to allow—we’re only going to allow people who express this viewpoint and not another viewpoint. Viewpoint discrimination really goes to the heart of what the First Amendment is intended to prohibit, so that even in a limited public forum where people are restricted with respect to what—the subject that they can talk about, government can’t impose a viewpoint discrimination. Senator DEWINE. It just seems to me, Judge, that we could talk about this issue all day, and we’re not going to, obviously, but that there is a shrinking public forum and the opportunities many times are going away. I guess you could make the other argument that because of modern technology, there are other opportunities with the Internet, et cetera, that they are opening up for people to communicate and to make their point well known. But a lot of the places that people historically have talked and made their point well known are shrinking. You talked about the malls, which certainly in most States are totally off limits to any kind of display of that kind of debate. Let me turn to commercial speech, if I could. Under current law, commercial speech is protected by the First Amendment, but it has never had the same level of protection as other forms of speech, such as political speech. The difference in treatment has puzzled a number of commentators and judges. In reviewing your cases, I noted that you are certainly familiar with the issue of commercial speech. In the Pitt News case, for instance, you struck down a

Pennsylvania statute that barred paid alcohol advertisements in newspapers affiliated with colleges and universities.
Let me ask you, Judge, based on your experience with this and other cases, what is your view about the distinction between commercial speech and noncommercial speech and is there a common sense difference between these two types of speeches and have you found that case law supports any distinction? How, if confirmed, will you approach the so-called commercial speech claims under the First Amendment?
Judge ALITO. Well, there’s a debate about how much protection commercial speech should have. There are those who argue that the distinction between commercial speech and noncommercial speech should be eliminated. The Supreme Court views commercial speech differently, and while it is strict about any limitation regarding accurate information about prices, it limits—it permits greater restriction of commercial speech under current case law than it does with respect to other types of speech. The theory, as I understand it, is that commercial speech is more durable. At least, that’s part of the theory. In other words, there’s such a great incentive for people who are selling things to engage in advertising and other forms of commercial speech that it’s less likely to be driven out than speech on other issues where the financing may not be as extensive.
In the Pitt News case, what I had to apply was the question of whether there was sufficient tailoring. There was a compelling interest for what was done there, which was to restrict advertising about alcohol in a publication that was affiliated with an educational institution. But based on the facts there, it just did not seem to be tailored at all. This was a newspaper that I think 75 percent of the people who received it, and it’s connected with the University of Pittsburgh, were people over the drinking age, and maybe even more to the point, this publication was distributed free on campus in newspaper boxes next to a number of others that contained commercial publications and they both advertised establishments and events in the area of the university and the others were full of information about alcoholic beverages and those were free, too.
So while the problem of underage drinking and abusive drinking on college campuses is a very serious issue, and the Pennsylvania legislature recognized that and we certainly didn’t question that, I mean, it is an issue of critical importance, it seemed quite unrealistic to think that this regulation, which only applied to the Pitt News and not to these other publications, was tailored sufficiently.
Senator DEWINE. I thank you, Judge. That is an interesting set of facts. I thank you, sir.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator DeWine. Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to try one more time. First of all, let me just say this. Senator Durbin said that Justice Roberts retired the trophy on performance. If that is true, you have retired it on equanimity. I really think you are to be congratulated. This is in this morning’s Washington Post, ‘‘Alito Says He Will Keep an Open Mind.’’ But what concerns me, and obviously this is

on Roe, is that despite 38 tests, despite 33 years, despite the support of a majority of America, you also said yesterday that precedent is not an inexorable command, and those are the words that Justice Rehnquist used arguing for the overturning of Roe.
My question is, did you mean it that way? Judge ALITO. The statement that precedent is not an inexorable command is a statement that has been in the Supreme Court case law for a long period of time, and sitting here I can’t remember what the origin of it is, but I would bet that it’s been—it certainly has been used in cases in which the Court has invoked the doctrine of stare decisis and refused to go ahead and overrule. Senator FEINSTEIN. I always believe everything I read in the Washington Post. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. Well, that is an important principle, and I—not the principle of believing everything in the Washington Post, but the principle that stare decisis is not an inexorable command, because then we would be stuck with decisions like Plessy, and they couldn’t be overruled except through a constitutional amendment. But when an issue is one that could realistically come up, the people who would be making the arguments on both sides of the issue have a right to have a judiciary of people with open minds, and that means people who haven’t announced in advance what they think about the issue, and more importantly, people who are not going to reach a conclusion in the—not going to reach a conclusion until they have gone through the judicial process. And it’s not a facade, it’s a—it’s not a meaningless exercise. It’s a very important one. Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me try this. I would like to read a line of questions that Senator Specter asked now Chief Justice Roberts, and then I would like to ask this question: how do you disagree with this? Here is the question. Specter: Judge Roberts, in your confirmation hearing for the Circuit Court, your testimony read to this effect, and it has been widely quoted. ‘‘Roe is the settled law of the land.’’ Do you mean settled for you, settled only for your capacity as a circuit judge or settled beyond that? Roberts: Well, beyond that. It’s settled as a precedent of the Court, entitled the respect under principles of stare decisis, and those principles applied in the Casey case explain when cases should be revisited and when they should not, and it is settled as a precedent of the Court, yes. Specter: You went on to say then, ‘‘It’s a little more than settled. It was reaffirmed in the face of a challenge, that it should be overruled in the Casey decision, so it has added precedentual value.’’ Roberts: I think the initial question for the judge confronting an issue in this area, you don’t go straight to Roe decision. You being with Casey, which modified the Roe framework and reaffirmed its central holding. Specter says: And you went on to say accordingly, ‘‘It’s the settled law of the land,’’ using the term settled again. And then your final statement as to this quotation, ‘‘There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying the precedent as well as Casey.’’

Where do you differ, since Justice Roberts made that statement in a confirmation hearing. He not only got confirmed, he is the Chief Justice. It seems to me appropriate for you to comment on it and say where you might differ with it.
Judge ALITO. Well, the statement covers a lot of ground, and let me try to remember the major points. I certainly agree with the point—
Senator FEINSTEIN. I can give it to you if you would like? Would that be helpful?
Judge ALITO. Certainly, I would be happy to look at it. Senator FEINSTEIN. Would someone take it down to him? Show him the place. [Pause.] Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I certainly agree with the point that the Chief Justice made about separating any personal views he has from anything that he would do as a member of the Supreme Court. I emphatically agree with that. That’s the essence of what a judge has to do. I certainly agree that Roe and Casey and all of the other decisions in this line are precedents of the Supreme Court, and they are entitled to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis to the extent that some of the earlier decisions have been modified, and obviously, the most recent ones are the relevant provisions of the Supreme Court. I have agreed, I think, numerous times during these hearings that when a decision is reaffirmed, that strengthens its value as stare decisis. I agree that when the Supreme Court entertains a challenge to a prior decision and says, ‘‘We’re not getting to re-examination of the merits of the issue, we think stare decisis counsel against our going to that point,’’ then that is a precedent on precedent. That seems to me to be entirely logical, and we have a long line of precedents now relating to this issue. I have said I think—I have said that stare decisis is a very important legal doctrine, and that there is a general presumption that decisions of the Court will not be overruled. There needs to be a special justification for doing it, but it is not an inexorable command. Senator FEINSTEIN. But you do not agree that it is well settled in the Court? Judge ALITO. I think that depends on what one means by the terms ‘‘well settled.’’ Senator FEINSTEIN. I actually agree with you, because others have said that, and then gone out and voted to overthrow it, so it is like saying, ‘‘I have no quarrel with that.’’ Judge ALITO. Let me just say this. As a judge on the court of appeals or if I’m confirmed as a Justice on the Supreme Court, it would be wrong for me to say to anybody who might be bringing any case before my court, ‘‘If you bring your case before my court, I’m not even going to listen to you. I’ve made up my mind on this issue. I’m not going to read your brief. I’m not going to listen to your argument. I’m not going to discuss the issue with my colleagues. Go away, I’ve made up my mind.’’ That’s the antithesis of what the courts are supposed to do, and if that’s what settled means, then I think that’s not what judges are supposed to do. We are—

Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me interrupt you for a moment if I may. You were willing to give your view on one man/one vote, and yet there are four cases pending in the court right now on one man/ one vote, and that is where I have a hard time. The cases are Lulac v. Perry, Travis County v. Perry, Jackson v. Perry, and GI Form of Texas v. Perry. That is where I have a hard time. If you are willing to say that you believe one man/one vote is well settled, and you agree with it, I have a hard time understanding how you separate out Roe. I understand why. If you say one thing, you upset my friends and colleagues on that side, if you say the other you upset those of us on this side. But the people are entitled to know.
Judge ALITO. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to speak about issues that could realistically come up, and my view about Brown v. Board of Education, for example, which was one of the cases that was cited in connection with this issue about where someone in my position should draw the line, seems to me to embody a principle that is now not subject to challenge, not realistically subject to being challenged, not within the legitimate scope of constitutional debate any longer that there should be segregated racial—facilities that are segregated on the basis of race, and that’s where I’ve tried to draw the line. If an issue involves something that is in litigation, then I think it’s not appropriate for me to go further than to say that I would be—I would be very respectful of the doctrine of stare decisis, and I would not reach a decision on the underlying issue, if one were to get to it, without going through the whole decisionmaking process.
Senator FEINSTEIN. OK. I will let you off the hook on that one. One of the reasons that some of us are so concerned about the Commerce Clause is because we see major law being overturned if the Rehnquist Court continues its march. Let me give you some examples concerning the environment, and these are cases that will be before you, so I do not expect you to comment on the case, but to understand them. The Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, and it included a provision permitting citizens or citizen groups to bring lawsuits for violation of the Act. In Public Interest Research Group of New Jersey v. Magnesium Electron, a citizen’s environmental group sued a chemical manufacturer under the Clean Water Act for polluting a river used by members of the group. The trial court found that the defendant committed 150 Clean Water Act violations. On appeal, you are the decisive vote in a 2–1 decision, overturning the trial court’s decision, even though it was undisputed that the defendant committed the 150 violations of the Clean Water Act. Your decision, as I understand it, was based upon your conclusion that the environmental group did not have standing to sue under the Clean Water Act, because even though members of the environmental group had stopped using the river due to the pollution, they did not prove any injury to the environment. The decision, if broadly applied, would have gutted the citizen lawsuit provision of the Clean Water Act. Now, 3 years later in Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw, the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, rejected this reasoning, and held that a citizen only needed to show that he or she was harmed by

533
the Clean Water Act violation, and did not need to prove a broader injury to the environment.
So you see where the concern comes with respect to overthrowing something on a technicality that can have enormous implications. Do you agree with the Supreme Court’s decision in Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw?
Judge ALITO. Well, it’s a precedent of the Court, and I have respect for it, and as you mentioned—and it’s governed by stare decisis, and as you mentioned, it was decided after the decision of my court in the Magnesium Electron case. And I haven’t gone back and thought about the question of whether Laidlaw creates doubt about the soundness of the decision in Magnesium Electron. If it does, then it does, and if the issue were to come up again before the Third Circuit, for example, and I sat on the issue, then I would follow Supreme Court precedent if I concluded that it was in conflict with the decision of the prior court of appeals decision.
We have—our jurisdiction, under the Constitution, is limited to cases and controversies, and the Supreme Court has said that means you have to have a plaintiff who has suffered injury in fact. And although there was a disagreement on the panel about the procedure we should use going forward, everybody on the panel agreed—Judge Roth and I who were in the majority, and Judge Lewis who dissented on a procedural point that I’ll get to—that the plaintiffs in that case had not even alleged personal injury. They alleged that they enjoyed the Delaware River in a variety of ways. As I recall, they walked along the canal path, they ate fish from the river, they drank water from the river, but there was no evidence that the discharges into a creek some distance upstream from the river had had any effect whatsoever on the river, and therefore, there was nothing to support a claim that they were personally injured by the discharges of this plant.
Now, there would presumably be other people who could take legal action against the plant for its violations of the law, and nobody would condone that, but our obligation under Article III is to confine ourselves to cases within our constitutional jurisdiction.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Of course you are going to have two cases challenging the application of the Clean Water Act to nonnavigable waters under the Commerce Clause, and as you probably know, we have lost 90 percent of the wetlands in the United States. This is a very big deal. I mean there are many of us that would hate to see wetlands be made virtually impossible because it is very difficult to prove when something becomes navigable, as opposed to nonnavigable, which is kind of the question that is before the Court. I only say that because if this march to restrict Congress continues, you could strike down the Endangered Species Act, you could strike down the Clean Water Act, you could strike down the Clean Air Act, and I think that would be catastrophic for the United States.
If I can, let me just switch to another topic. A year ago all of us became very concerned and involved and some horrified with the Terri Schiavo case, and as I recall the case, the local courts held that her life support could be turned off. The State Supreme Court held the same thing. And then there was an effort—and I think a Federal district court held it—to bring it up to the Supreme Court.

534
What do you believe the role of the Federal courts should be in the arena of end-of-life decisions?
Judge ALITO. Well, there’s a constitutional issue, certainly, at the bottom of that and there are issues of jurisdiction. There are statutory issues and Congress specifies the jurisdiction of the lower courts and so Congress can give us a role in decisions of this nature or Congress can keep the Federal courts out of it and leave it to the State courts where, for the most part, issues in this area have been adjudicated. But if there is a Federal constitutional right involved, then someone may have jurisdiction—then, of course, the Federal courts have traditionally been a forum for the adjudication of Federal constitutional rights.
The underlying statutory—I’m sorry, the constitutional issue is the one that the Supreme Court addressed in the Cruzan case and in the case of Washington v. Glucksburg, and this is obviously one of the most sensitive issues that comes up in our legal system and involves something that a lot of people have had to face and a lot more people are going to have to face decisions involving the end of life, and with the advances in medical technology, this is going to be a very tough issue for an awful lot of people.
In Cruzan, the Court proceeded on—they said, we assume that there is a constitutional right to refuse medical treatment that a person doesn’t want, and there certainly has long been a common law right to refuse medical treatment that a person doesn’t want. If somebody gives you medical treatment and you say, ‘‘I don’t want it,’’ and they perform an operation on you or do something like that, that’s a battery under the common law and you can be sued, and the Supreme Court assumed that that was a fundamental right under due process but said that there wasn’t a violation of the right under the circumstances in Cruzan, where the State of Missouri had imposed certain restrictions—regulations that had to be complied with before a person who was comatose could be taken off life support.
And then in Washington v. Glucksburg, they addressed the issue of whether there was a constitutional right to assisted suicide and they concluded that there was not, that there were—and they applied the standard to be applied under the Due Process Clause or its substantive component, whether a right is firmly rooted in the traditions of our country and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, but there were some concurring opinions that recognized that these were issues that were on the cutting edge of medical technology, let me put it that way, or they were issues on which more empirical evidence might become relevant in the future.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. I notice I just have 40 seconds left. Will we have another round, Mr. Chairman?

case after case that you have been asked about, you have gone as far as you legitimately should go to express your understanding of the law and what is important there.
I know your entire record has been examined extensively. You think about it, the FBI does a background check. They found out every place you lived and talked to your neighbors and checked your criminal history. The Department of Justice has a big inquiry that they do before they submit your nomination to the President, or the President submits your nomination to the Senate. The American Bar Association has interviewed 300 of your colleagues before they made their recommendation that you are well qualified in a unanimous vote. The Senate has its questionnaire. Outside groups look at it and create studies and data. They read everything you have written to find things that they might be unhappy with. So I think, all in all, you are coming through this with very little mud upon you, for which I congratulate you. I think it is something that you can be proud of. Most of us on this side of the aisle would not like to have our record scrutinized in the way yours has been.
I know some of us have made mistakes in our statements already in the hearing, we have to admit. I will admit that I was one of them. I first said that you were ranked No. 4 in being the most independent judge out of 900 judges in the country. As I see the numbers more clearly, you were No. 4 out of 98 appellate judges examined in that system, but that still shows that you are an independent, nonideological judge, willing to—one of the factors they used was whether or not you always agreed with nominees of your party, and so I think that speaks well for your record and that is why you have gained such a broad respect from your colleagues.
I just wanted to briefly mention some of these studies that go into your background. People have looked at it, incredibly, to the most minute detail. You were asked earlier about saying that you only rule one out of eight times for immigrants seeking asylum, but looking at the asylum cases nationwide, most of those are the government’s position is affirmed. It has already been decided by a lower court or administrative body. You are simply reviewing their decision.
But in immigrant asylum cases nationwide, the court of appeals generally ruled for the asylum-seeker 11 percent of the time. During your record on the bench, you ruled for asylum-seekers 18 percent of the time. In your published opinions, the average court of appeals judge in America ruled for immigrants 8 percent of the time. In your published opinions, you ruled for them 19 percent of the time.
I think this not only shows that the charges against you there are not well placed, it shows just how carefully your record is being examined by people as you move through the system.
Another example, civil rights. I think your critics have cherrypicked from some of your 4,800 cases that you have ruled on. In your opinions on civil rights, your panel was unanimous 90 percent of the time, and when you sat on a panel where both the other judges were Democratic appointees, your decision was unanimous 100 percent of the time. So I think that speaks well for your overall record on civil rights. It certainly would indicate that you are not hostile to a legitimate civil rights complaint.

You were asked about one environmental case by Senator Feinstein, and you ruled on that case based on standing. That is an important issue in the legal system, don’t you agree?
Judge ALITO. It is— Senator SESSIONS. It is a well recognized principle. Judge ALITO. It is a constitutional principle. Senator SESSIONS. It does not have to do with whether you were for or against the environmental issue in question, but simply whether the person bringing the suit was a legitimate person to bring that suit. Judge ALITO. That’s right, and it doesn’t have anything to do with Congress’s power to regulate the environment under the Commerce Clause. That’s a separate question. Congress—it’s totally separate. One has to do with the scope of congressional power. The other has to do with who can bring the suit. Senator SESSIONS. And with regard to environmental cases, you have rendered, according to one of these studies, you have authored six environmental opinions. You sided with the environmental regulatory body in five of those six opinions. Indeed, Professor Cass Sunstein, who has served as an advisor to the Democratic members of this Committee on changing the ground rules of confirmation, which was really a precursor to the commencement of a filibuster, Professor Cass Sunstein said this about you. Quote, ‘‘This is a judge who, if the text is pro-environment, he is very likely to follow it. This is not someone who, like some judges, has a kind of probusiness orientation in his approach to the law.’’ I think that is also a statement that you can take pride in. I would offer for the record, Mr. Chairman, another article by Stuart Taylor of the National Journal, Monday, December 12, in which he, in a very effective way, dismisses much of the complaints that have been made against Judge Alito— Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, that will be made part of the record. Senator SESSIONS. He says the systematic—this is his quote. ‘‘The systematic slanting, conscious or unconscious, of this and many other news reports have helped fuel a disingenuous campaign by liberal groups and Senators to caricature Alito as a conservative ideologue. In fact, this is a judge who, while surely too conservative for the taste of liberal ideologues, is widely admired by liberals, moderates, and conservatives who know him well as a fair-minded, committed to apolitical judging and wedded to no ideological agenda other than restraint in the exercise of judicial power,’’ close quote. I would offer that for the record. Also, with regard to your challenges on Vanguard, on matters that have impacted your integrity, I would like to quote from the American Bar Association’s interview questionnaires that they did on you among those who know you well. This is what they put in their conclusion. ‘‘Conclusion: We accept his explanation and do not believe these matters reflect adversely on him,’’ talking about those conflict allegations. They go on to say, ‘‘To the contrary, consistent and virtually unanimous comments from those interviewed include he has utmost integrity, he is a straight-shooter, very honest and calls them as he sees them.’’ These are quotes from different lawyers and judges. ‘‘His reputation is impeccable. You could find no

one with better integrity. His integrity and character are of the highest caliber. He is completely forthright and honest. His integrity is absolutely unquestionable. He is a man of great integrity.’’ And then they conclude, ‘‘On the basis of our interviews with Judge Alito and with well over 300 judges and lawyers and members of the legal community nationwide, all of whom know Judge Alito professionally, the Standing Committee concluded that Judge Alito is an individual of excellent integrity.’’ So congratulations on that finding.
Judge Alito, many important decisions of the Supreme Court in recent years touch on the deepest values of the American people. They deal with things like Kelo and the property that they own, matters of faith and morality, decency and pornography. Do you have a sense of where the American people are with regard to these issues? Can you indicate to us that you have any appreciation for the legitimacy of some of those concerns?
Judge ALITO. Well, I do, Senator, and I— Senator SESSIONS. Regardless of the technical laws it involves, but just that fundamental policy. Judge ALITO. I think I have an appreciation of people’s concerns. Certainly with respect to Kelo, which is a recent decision and I can’t comment on how I would rule on any matter concerning that, and it involves the power to take property for public use through eminent domain, I certainly understand that what occurred in that case, which, as I understand it, was the taking of the homes of people of modest means for the purpose of building a large commercial facility that would be—that was thought by the city to be beneficial to the economic welfare of the city, but this is an enormous blow to the people whose homes are being taken. People live in homes and they have a sentimental attachment to them. They have memories that are attached to the homes. They can remember what happened in particular rooms. The neighborhood means something to them, the neighbors mean something to them. The things in the home mean something to them. And taking their home away and giving them money in return, even if they get fair market value for the home, is still an enormous loss for people. So I certainly can appreciate what they feel in that respect. Senator SESSIONS. Well, let’s talk about that a little bit. Because this is a matter of real power and it is a matter that the Congress gets drawn into sometimes whether we want to be drawn into it or not. We have discussed Roe v. Wade, people remain concerned about that. The polling numbers continue to drift against that decision. We talk about the district court opinion I believe Senator Brownback raised, a Federal court, on marriage, on redefining the traditional statutory definition on marriage contained in States and in State constitutions around the country. In Kelo, it is pretty clear to me that the Court just changed the meaning of the words. The Constitution said you could take property for public use; the Court felt that was too restrictive, basically, and a majority just changed it to say you could take property for a public purpose, which could include some private redevelopment on the area, in their minds. See, that is not founded in the Constitution. That is an overreach, in my opinion. On the Pledge of Allegiance case, the Newdow case, the Ninth Circuit, which includes approximately 20

538
percent of the people in the United States, ruled that the Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court sort of sidestepped the fundamental issue and said that there was not standing on behalf of Mr. Newdow, and sent that back to a lower court. He now got him some plaintiffs that apparently have standing. He has taken it to the district court in California, and he has won that case. They have concluded that the Ninth Circuit law remains in effect so that 20 percent of the population of the United States, really, are not able, if you follow that opinion, to render the Pledge of Allegiance. Yet we have chaplains and In God We Trust in the Senate chamber and those kind of issues.
So I don’t believe that that is founded in the Constitution. I think the American people do not. And they are asking some real questions of us. So I guess I won’t try to get you drawn into those.
But I want to do this. The doctrine of judicial review, Marbury v. Madison. You already indicated Hamilton didn’t favor that. But the Court found it. But it is not expressly stated in the Constitution, is it?
Judge ALITO. No, it’s not. Senator SESSIONS. And it definitely shifts the balance of power between the branches because the Court now has the power to, by a stroke of its pen, five of its nine members, to strike down any law they say violates the Constitution. That is true, is it not? Judge ALITO. Well, they decide constitutional questions, and the doctrine has been established since Marbury v. Madison, that’s right. Senator SESSIONS. Well, but there are explicit powers given to the Congress. And Senator Coburn raised some of those. Article III, Section 2 has these words: ‘‘In all the other Cases before mentioned,’’—this is the Constitution’s grant of power to the courts— ‘‘the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.’’ Now, those words are in the Constitution, are they not? Judge ALITO. Yes, they are. Senator SESSIONS. And as you said, if the words are expected to have some meaning, you would give them some meaning, at least, would you not? Judge ALITO. I think that’s undisputed, that they have a meaning. Senator SESSIONS. So Congress has some power here. We have not exercised that power, certainly in recent years. In Ex Parte McCardle, the Supreme Court in 1869 agreed that, though the judicial power is conferred by the Constitution, it is conferred under such exceptions as Congress shall make. Then there is the Impeachment power—the Senator mentioned that. And then the establishment of lower courts. Article III, Section 1 says, ‘‘The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as Congress may from time to time establish.’’ That indicates that Congress can establish or disestablish courts, does it not? Judge ALITO. I think it’s undisputed that the so-called inferior courts—and I don’t particularly like the term as a judge of the

539
court of appeals—but the so-called inferior courts are totally the creation of Congress.
Senator SESSIONS. Now I would just ask you to comment on this thought. Chief Justice Roberts, in his hearings—and I asked him some questions similar to this—indicated that he was concerned about activism by the Court, overreaching by the Court, and he felt that this overreaching had the—created a danger that it could undermine respect for law in our country. Do you share that view?
Judge ALITO. I agree that overreaching by the courts can undermine respect for law. Our authority is based on the belief that what we are doing is different from what Congress is doing. Because otherwise, why would people tolerate our functioning? Nobody elects us. And we have a system of Government that is fundamentally democratic. It’s based on the sovereignty of the people. So how do you explain an unelected branch of Government making decisions?
So all of our authority is based on the idea, which was expressed in Marbury v. Madison, that the Constitution is law. It’s not conceptually different from statutory law. And our job is to interpret the Constitution—it has a meaning—and apply it to the situations that come up.
Senator SESSIONS. Well, right now there is a strong feeling that I share that the Court on some very important issues that people care deeply about is exceeding its authority. They are calling on me and members of—and those of us in Congress to do something about it. I get a lot of letters saying withdraw jurisdiction, why aren’t you supporting legislation to do that? And Congress, I think, has shown restraint.
But I hope that when you become a member of this august body, the Supreme Court—and I believe you will—that you will take those concerns with you and share with the members of the Court that their views on policy issues are of no greater value than mine, frankly—at least in my opinion they are not—and that the Congress has been showing some restraint here. But we really want the Court to be more modest and to draw back from some of its intervention in policy issues that are causing much angst around the country.
If you want to comment on that. Otherwise, Mr. Chairman, I would yield my time.
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I think your policy views are much more legitimate than the policy views of the judiciary because Members of Congress are elected for the purpose of formulating and implementing public policy. And members of the judiciary are appointed for the purpose of interpreting and applying the law.
Senator SESSIONS. Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. We will now stand in recess until 4:20. [Recess 4:04 p.m. to 4:20 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume. We will turn to Senator Feingold for 20 minutes. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon, Judge. I hope, if nothing else, you associate me with breaks in the proceedings, because it seems to happen every time my questions are up.

Judge, yesterday I asked you about your preparation for these hearings over the past few months with a variety of practice sessions. You confirmed that you had had these sessions and that a great variety of subjects came up in them, and that is fine. I know this is not an easy process, and I would certainly expect you to prepare in this way.
What I want to ask now, though, is simply if you can provide a list of all the people who participated in any of those practice sessions, and I would request that the folks here sitting behind you in back of the Department of Justice help you put that list together this evening and get it to us tomorrow morning so that we have time to ask about it during tomorrow’s session, if necessary. Can you do that for me, Judge?
Judge ALITO. I certainly have no objection to that. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you very much. Now I want to get into a subject that really requires some attention here and hasn’t had much attention given the important role that it plays in the job of a Supreme Court Justice, and that is the issue of capital punishment or the death penalty. Judge Alito, the idea that defendants are entitled to effective legal representation is a fundamental part of our criminal justice system. In fact, of course, it is enshrined in the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee that the accused have ‘‘the assistance of counsel for his defense.’’ Nowhere is this guarantee obviously more important than in cases where the defendant’s life is on the line. In a death penalty case you decided in 2004 called Rompilla v. Horn, you rejected the defendant’s argument that his attorneys had failed to do an adequate investigation to prepare for his sentencing hearing. As a result, key mitigating evidence about his horrible childhood was never presented to the sentencing jury, which ultimately sentenced him to death. As you know, the Supreme Court reversed your decision, ruling that the defense attorney’s failure to even review evidence they knew the prosecution was going to introduce at sentencing violated the Sixth Amendment. This case was one of several Supreme Court cases in recent years to express particular concern—particular concern about the adequacy of indigent representation and the fairness of the capital sentencing process. In fact, in several recent decisions, including Rompilla, the Court has overturned death sentences because defense attorneys did not do adequate investigations to turn up potential mitigating evidence and because jury instructions did not clearly allow jurors to consider any and all possible mitigating evidence. And Justice O’Connor, whom you have been nominated to replace, has, of course, often been the author or the deciding vote in these cases. Judge, what are your views on these issues? Is the Court’s recent emphasis on the importance of fully developing and considering mitigating evidence in capital sentencing proceedings headed in the right direction? Judge ALITO. It is vitally important that all criminal defendants receive effective representation, and I could not agree with you more strongly that this is of the utmost importance in death penalty cases where so much is at stake.

541
In the Rompilla case that you mentioned, we had to apply the standard of review that is set out in the habeas corpus statute as revised by Congress. And where there has been a determination on the merits by the State courts on an issue like whether a defendant received effective representation within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment and where the State courts have applied the correct legal standard, we are not allowed to disturb their decision unless what they did was unreasonable.
Senator FEINGOLD. Well, let me ask you then, because you are obviously pointing out the fact that you approached the Rompilla case as an appellate court judge bound by prior Supreme Court precedent, and yet you found that no constitutional violation had occurred. And I believe when we discussed this case in my office, you indicated you still think your decision was correct.
So the question now is: Would your approach have been any different as a Supreme Court Justice? What about your decision on the outcome of the case?
Judge ALITO. Well, my decision, I spoke directly to the issue in the Rompilla case as I saw it when it came before me. And my evaluation of the performance of the attorneys in that case was fully set out in the opinion that I wrote. They were—one of them was a very experienced criminal defense attorney. He was the head of the public defender’s office, and there was no dispute whatsoever that this was an attorney of competence and experience and great dedication to the defendant in this case, and that attorney was assisted by another attorney in the office, and together they were extremely dedicated to this case.
Now, a number of judges took a look at this. All of the Pennsylvania judiciary, with the possible exception of one justice—I can’t remember clearly whether there was one justice who disagreed— thought that there had been effective representation provided in this case.
Senator FEINGOLD. This really isn’t about the difference between being on the court of appeals and the Supreme Court. You apparently, based on what you know, would have ruled the same way had you been on the Supreme Court.
Judge ALITO. Well, my evaluation of the facts of the case would be the same. Now, if a case came—
Senator FEINGOLD. In other words, that there was not a violation of the Sixth Amendment.
Judge ALITO. Well, I should add, however, that if a case came up in the future, the Supreme Court’s decision in that case is a precedent that I would have to deal with. And they—
Senator FEINGOLD. Fair enough. Judge ALITO [continuing]. Expressed a view as to how the standard applies to the facts of the case. It was a 5–4 decision. But it would be a precedent that I would follow. Senator FEINGOLD. Well, now let’s go back to my original question, which is, Do you think the Supreme Court has been heading in the right direction in these cases? Judge ALITO. Well, I think that the Supreme Court is correct in viewing this as a very important part of the criminal justice system, and in particular, a very important part of the representation of clients in Eighth Amendment cases.

542
Senator FEINGOLD. Isn’t the Court doing more than that? The Court is moving in the direction of giving greater recognition and ruling on the inadequacy of counsel in this case.
Judge ALITO. And I think it’s entirely appropriate that there be a searching review in every case as to whether a defendant in any criminal case, but in particular, of course, in a capital case, has received the representation that the defendant is entitled to under the Sixth Amendment.
Senator FEINGOLD. Do you think your replacing Justice O’Connor will change the direction of the Court in this regard?
Judge ALITO. I would approach these cases under the law that the Supreme Court has established in this area, with the recognition that I have attempted to explain of how important I believe this right is in all cases and in death cases in particular. When the Supreme Court reviews a case that has come up through the Federal system, in a habeas proceeding, then the Supreme Court, just like my court, should apply the standards that are set out in the habeas corpus statute.
Senator FEINGOLD. Let’s go to a different one. Wiggins v. Smith is a Supreme Court case decided in 2003 also addressing inadequate mitigation investigation. In that case, Justice O’Connor, writing for the majority, found trial counsel ineffective for failing to conduct an adequate investigation into possible mitigating evidence that could be presented at sentencing. Had the attorney done adequate investigation, he would have found abundant evidence of childhood physical and sexual abuse as well as diminished mental capacity. Do you think that case was right decided?
Judge ALITO. Well, I discussed Wiggins in Rompilla, and I thought that it was distinguishable. Wiggins, as described, as I recall it, was a case where the attorney had reason—the attorney simply didn’t conduct an investigation without any sound strategic reason for not investigating a particular matter.
Senator FEINGOLD. So you have no sense that that was wrongly decided?
Judge ALITO. I have no sense that that was wrong. I thought it was different from the Rompilla case.
Senator FEINGOLD. According to two independent studies, your record in death penalty cases has been more anti-capital defendant even than most Republican-appointed judges. In fact, in every disputed capital case that you heard, that is, cases in which a panel of three judges did not all agree, you would have ruled against the defendant. How do you explain this seeming tendency to favor the Government in capital cases?
Judge ALITO. I have only sat on a handful of capital cases, and in some of them I voted to uphold the death penalty, and in a number of them I voted to strike down the death penalty. In Carpenter v. Vaughn, I voted to strike down the death penalty. In the most recent death penalty case I sat on, the Bronshtein case, I voted to strike down the death penalty because of the procedure that was followed at the penalty phase in that case. In the Cruz case, I was part of a panel that vacated a decision of the district court rejecting the claim of a habeas petitioner. There have been other cases where I voted to uphold the death penalty.

543
Senator FEINGOLD. Justice Stevens recently gave a speech at the American Bar Association in which he raised a number of serious concerns about the administration of the death penalty. He pointed to aspects of capital proceedings that he believes unfairly tilt the balance in favor of the prosecution both at the trial and sentencing stages. Specifically, he raised concerns about the jury selection process, arguing that jurors are questioned so extensively about the death penalty that they might assume their role is primarily to decide this sentence for a presumptively guilty defendant.
He also argued that a representation of indigent defendants remains an issue that has not been adequately addressed, and he noted that elected State judges may have a ‘‘subtle bias’’ in favor of death because they have to face re-election.
Now, I know all of us on this Committee have the greatest respect for State court judges, but we all can understand the pressures of a re-election campaign. So what are your views on the potential of these three issues—the jury selection, the inadequate representation, and an elected judiciary—to skew a capital prosecution against the defendant? And do you share these concerns that Justice Stevens outlined?
Judge ALITO. I certainly share a concern that there should be a fair procedure for the selection of jurors. That certainly is a concern. The issue of the election of judges at the State level or the appointment of judges at the State level is a matter for State legislatures to decide, and within my circuit, we have three States. In New Jersey and in Delaware, the State judiciary is appointed; in Pennsylvania, the State judiciary is elected. And I’ve had the opportunity to view the work of all three of the Supreme Courts in those States, and I think they all are of a very high quality. I think the elected judges in Pennsylvania do a conscientious effort to carry out their responsibilities, and I think—I have a high regard for the judiciary in all of those States.
So based on the experience of—on my experience, I think you can have highly competent and certainly conscientious State judges who are appointed and the same sort of judges who are elected. And, of course, we do have habeas corpus and it is an important— it’s important to make sure that constitutional rights are respected, and the scope of the review that we conduct under habeas is up to Congress. Congress reformulated the standards in the AEDPA, in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, limiting our review, and it’s our obligation to conduct the kind of review that Congress has indicated we should be conducting.
Senator FEINGOLD. Well, Judge, it sounds like you perhaps have a lesser level of concern about some of these matters than Justice Stevens. The only thing I would note is that one of the most striking things about the history of Justices that have gone to the Court sometimes who are pro-death penalty, an amazing number have come to the conclusion that this is the one area where, once they get there, they realize that these problems are much more severe than they might have thought before they became Supreme Court Justices, and I, should you be confirmed, look forward to how you react to these issues after you’ve become a Supreme Court Justice, should you do so.

In the past few years, the Supreme Court has limited the application of the death penalty based on the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. In Atkins v. Virginia, the Court ruled that mentally retarded inmates cannot be executed, and in Roper v. Simmons, it held that individuals who were minors when they committed capital crimes cannot be executed as punishment for their actions.
Do you agree with these decisions? Judge ALITO. Those decisions applied the standard that the Supreme Court formulated sometime earlier in determining whether the imposition of the death penalty on particular categories of defendants would violate the Eighth Amendment, and they looked to evolving standards of decency. And that is a line of precedent in the Supreme Court, and those are precedents of the Supreme Court, and they’re entitled to the respect of stare decisis. Senator FEINGOLD. Can you just tell me what your general approach to the Eighth Amendment would be in the context of the death penalty? Judge ALITO. My approach would be to work within the body of precedent that we have. As I mentioned earlier, the Supreme Court has devoted a lot of attention to this issue since 1976 when it held that the death penalty is permissible, provided that adequate procedures are implemented by the States so that the decision about who receives the death penalty and who does not is not arbitrary and capricious, so that there is a rationality to the selection process. And the rules in this area are quite complex, but I would work within the body of precedent that is available. Senator FEINGOLD. Let me go to a topic that we have talked about before. We had a good discussion of the recusal issue in the Vanguard case yesterday, and I hadn’t intended to ask more about it. But your discussions with Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch today make further questioning a little bit necessary. Senator Hatch noted that the Committee’s questionnaire asked about financial conflicts of interest during the period of your initial service as a judge. Now, the reason for wording the question like that, of course, is that nominees have no way of knowing when they are up for confirmation whether they will have the same investments 5, 10, 25 years later. The Committee obviously can’t ask for a comprehensive list of possible future financial conflicts. So, for example, if you have stock in Microsoft and you list that as a financial conflict on your questionnaire, you still have to recuse yourself from a Microsoft case 15 years later if you still have the stock. Isn’t that right? Judge ALITO. If you’re required to recuse yourself if you have stock in Microsoft, even one share, you must recuse yourself. Senator FEINGOLD. You still have to recuse yourself even if it is 15 years later, right? Judge ALITO. Certainly that’s true. Senator FEINGOLD. So the question in the Senate questionnaire about financial investments is not time-limited based on the question being about initial service on the court, is it? Judge ALITO. Well, I want to be clear on my answer respecting this as it bears on the Monga case, the Vanguard case, because that’s what we’re discussing.

545
The wording of the Senate questionnaire was not the reason for the way I settled the case, and I’ve tried—
Senator FEINGOLD. I just want to know if you have any question in your mind why the question is phrased that way on the questionnaire.
Judge ALITO. Reading the question, it does seem to me that ‘‘initial period of service’’ is a temporal limitation.
Senator FEINGOLD. I want to be sure we don’t leave the impression from these hearings that people don’t have an obligation to recuse themselves from a financial conflict just because of the passage of time. You have already indicated if that financial conflict continues, that is an indefinite and permanent restriction until that financial holding is gone. Isn’t that—
Judge ALITO. Absolutely, and that’s under the Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(C)(3) I think it is. If you have a financial interest, you must recuse yourself, and that’s, of course, a continuing obligation.
Senator FEINGOLD. It is not temporal? Judge ALITO. The obligation to comply with the code of conduct for Federal judges applies to every Federal judge for as long as they serve. Senator FEINGOLD. And that is why I have to say that I am a bit frustrated that people are trying to obscure what I think was pretty clear testimony by you yesterday by bringing up this period of initial service issue. In response to Senator Kennedy, you made it clear again that your failure to recuse in the Vanguard case had nothing to do with the suggestion that your promise was time-limited. But I want to get this on the record again, and hopefully this will lay any confusion to rest. This idea that your promise to the Committee was somehow limited to your initial service on the court, that was not the reason you failed to recuse yourself from the case in 2002, was it? Judge ALITO. It was not the reason in 2002. I do think reading the question, it has a temporal limitation. If that wasn’t the intent, I think people could read it—certainly when you say ‘‘initial period of service,’’ people will read that to mean— Senator FEINGOLD. This has nothing to do with why you didn’t recuse yourself. Judge ALITO. It did not have to do with what I did in the Monga case. Senator FEINGOLD. And it is not as if you noticed that Vanguard was a party, remembered your promise to the Committee, and then made a specific decision not to recuse because the promise had expired? Judge ALITO. No, it was not that at all. Senator FEINGOLD. And you finally added Vanguard to your standing recusal list in December 2003 and it is on your list today. Isn’t that right? Judge ALITO. It is on my list today. Senator FEINGOLD. Do you plan to recuse yourself from Vanguard cases that come before the Supreme Court if you are confirmed for as long as you keep your Vanguard mutual funds? Judge ALITO. Well, if I am confirmed, I will very strictly comply with the ethical obligations that apply to Supreme Court Justices.

Supreme Court recusals are a bit different from recusals in the court of appeals, and so the obligation to sit when you are not recused is one that has to be considered very seriously by somebody on the Supreme Court or, I would think, on a State supreme court, for example.
Senator FEINGOLD. Is there any question, if you still have holdings in Vanguard and a case comes before the Supreme Court that you should recuse yourself?
Judge ALITO. Well, under the Code of Judicial Conduct, I don’t believe that I am required to recuse myself in Vanguard cases. And I would strictly comply with the ethical obligations that apply to a Supreme Court Justice.
Senator FEINGOLD. You are not going to make a promise here that you are not going to rule on Vanguard cases while you have holdings in Vanguard when you are on the Supreme Court?
Judge ALITO. Well, what I want to say about recusals on the Supreme Court is that the decisionmaking process on the Supreme Court, or any court with a fixed membership, a fixed number of jurists who sit on each case, recusal in that situation creates—affects the decisionmaking process because instead of having 9 Justices, you have 8, you have the potential for a tie.
On the court of appeals, that is a much less significant consideration because we always sit in panels of three, we have many judges on our court and many cases, so if I don’t sit on a case involving Vanguard, it just means somebody else will sit on the case involving Vanguard, it will still be decided by a three-judge panel.
Senator FEINGOLD. I would add on that point that that may be true, but it is also true that the Supreme Court is the last stop, and if somebody does not recuse himself, there is really no remedy, and that is why it is so important that somebody would recuse himself.
Judge ALITO. It is very important for somebody on the Supreme Court to fulfill strictly the obligation not to sit when the person should not sit, but it’s also important for—given the matters that I just discussed—for a Justice to sit if the Justice is not required to recuse.
Senator FEINGOLD. Judge, my time is up. Mr. Chairman, we do not yet have the communication from Judge Alito to the clerk on December 10th, 2003 that caused Vanguard to be added to his standing recusal list, and whether that was an e-mail or a form that Judge Alito filled out or something else, we have requested it, so I am just asking for the assistance of the Chairman in getting that document so we can complete the record. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Feingold, we will take a look at it and see what the facts are. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feingold. Senator Graham? Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, maybe we could continue with the Vanguard issues just for a moment, and I know you have been asked every conceivable combination of questions, but Senator Feingold is very sincere about ethics in Government. He practices what he preaches, and he

has been one of the leaders trying to make this place operate better. My impression of you is that you are a good model for judges in terms of ethical conduct based on what everybody says who knows you. I do not claim to be a close associate of yours, but the ABA has looked at this and said that it did not reflect poorly on you. Three hundred lawyers and judges who know you have said that you are just really sort of what we want in a judge, and maybe that is not enough, but that is a pretty good start. I do not think you could get 300 people to say that about me or some of us, but.
The question I have, the criminal prosecutor or lawyer in me has this question to ask: why would you make a conscious decision not to recuse yourself? Why would Judge Alito sit down in the corner of a room and say, ‘‘I think I’ve got a conflict, but I’m just going to let it go and hear the case anyway?’’ I am baffled as to why you would make a conscious decision in this situation not to recuse yourself. Do you have an explanation?
Judge ALITO. There’s no reason why I would make such a conscious decision. I had nothing whatsoever to gain by participating in this case, and nobody has suggested that I did. This case involved some thousands of dollars. Vanguard manages billions of dollars of funds. The idea that the outcome of this case could have some effect on the mutual funds that I hold is beyond preposterous, and I don’t understand anybody to have suggested anything like that.
Senator GRAHAM. I have been asking myself that question quietly, what is in it for this guy? Why would he bring all of this grief upon himself consciously? Is it to intentionally break a promise to the Senate so you would go through hell for 3 days? I do not think so. So I am going to accept your word, like the ABA, and I am going to move on, and I do not know if anybody else will.
Now, your days at Princeton, the more I know about Princeton, it is an interesting place.
[Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. What is an eating society? Judge ALITO. It’s a—the eating clubs are privately owned facilities where upperclassmen join for the purpose of taking their meals. The first 2 years, when I was there—the situation is now a bit more diversified as far as eating is concerned—but when I was there, and traditionally, the freshmen and sophomores ate in university dining halls, and then as juniors and seniors they had to find other places to eat, and these were private facilities. Senator GRAHAM. What is a selective eating society? Judge ALITO. It’s one where you apply to be a member like a fraternity, and you go through a process that is somewhat similar to that, and they select you if they like you. Senator GRAHAM. Were you a member of a selective eating society? Judge ALITO. No, I was not. Senator GRAHAM. Did people not like you, or— [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM [continuing]. You just did not apply? Judge ALITO. I didn’t apply. Senator GRAHAM. Let me tell you who did apply. Donald Rumsfeld was a member of a selective eating society at Princeton, and

that is an interesting comment I thought. Woodrow Wilson, Jim Leach, good friend of mine over in the House. Mitch Daniels, the Governor of Indiana, was a member of a nonselective eating society. Senator Claiborne Pell was a member of nonselective eating societies. And other Princeton alumni who are Members of Congress could not verify their participation or lack thereof in eating clubs, including Senator Sarbanes, Bond, Frist and Representative Marshall, and I promise you, I will get to the bottom of that before this is all done.
[Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. This organization that was mentioned very prominently earlier in the day, did you ever write an article for this organization? Judge ALITO. No, I did not. Senator GRAHAM. Some quotes were shown from people who did write for this organization that you disavowed. Do you remember that exchange? Judge ALITO. I disavow them. I deplore them. I—they represent things that I have always stood against, and I can’t express too strongly. Senator GRAHAM. If you do not mind, the suspicious nature that I have is that you may be saying that because you want to get on the Supreme Court, that you are disavowing this now because it does not look good. Really, what I would look at to believe you or not—I am going to be very honest with you—is how have you lived your life? Are you really a closet bigot? Judge ALITO. I’m not any kind of a bigot. I’m not— Senator GRAHAM. No, sir, you are not. And you know why I believe that? Not because you just said it, but that is a good enough reason because you seem to be a decent, honorable man. I have reams of quotes from people who have worked with you, AfricanAmerican judges—I have lost my quotes, I do not know where they are—but glowing quotes about who you are, the way you have lived your life, law clerks, men and women, black and white, your colleagues who say that ‘‘Sam Alito, whether I agree with him or not, is a really good man.’’ And do you know why I believe you when you say that you disavow those quotes? Because of the way you have lived your life and the way you and your wife are raising your children. Let me tell you this, guilt by association is going to drive good men and women away from wanting to sit where you are sitting. And we are going to go through this ourselves as Congressmen and Senators. People are going to take the fact that we got a campaign donation from somebody who is found out to be a little different than we thought they were, and our political opponents are going to say, ‘‘Aha, I got you.’’ And we are going to say, ‘‘Wait a minute. I didn’t know that. I didn’t take the money for that reason.’’ You know what? I am going to believe these Senators and Congressmen for the most part because that is the way we do our business. We meet people here every day. We have photos taken with people, and sometimes you wish you did not have your photo taken. But that does not mean that you are a bad person because of that association. Judge Alito, I am sorry that you have had to go through this. I am sorry that your family has had to sit here and listen to this.

Let’s talk about another time not so long ago, and another judge, and some of her writings, and see if the Senate is changing for the better or for the worse. Justice Ginsburg, who I need to go have a cup of coffee with because I constantly bring her up, and I do not dislike the lady, I admire her. But let’s put it bluntly, under today’s environment from a conservative’s point of view, she would have a very hard time, because Justice Ginsburg was the General Counsel for the ACLU from 1973 to 1980, and if you want me to tar somebody by their association, I can put up some pretty wild cases from my point of view where she was involved. But you know what? I respect her because her job as an attorney for the ACLU is to represent the most unpopular causes. As far as I can tell, during her time with the ACLU, she was honest, she was ethical, and she fought for the most unpopular causes, and for that, I respect her.
But you put some things down on an application about your view of the law in Roe v. Wade, and it is taking an unbelievable effort on your part, I think, to convince people that when I was a lawyer I did this, when I applied for a job I was doing this, and as a judge I will do this.
Here is what Justice Ginsburg said in an article she wrote titled ‘‘Some Thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relationship to Roe v. Wade.’’ ‘‘The conflict, however, is not simply one between a fetus’s interest and a woman’s interest, narrowly conceived. Nor is the overriding issue State versus private control of a woman’s body for a span of 9 months. Also in the balance is a woman’s autonomous charge of her full life’s course, her ability to stand in relation to man, society and the State as an independent self-sustaining equal citizen.’’
She wrote further, ‘‘As long as the Government paid for childbirth, the argument proceeded, public funding could not be denied for abortion, often a safer and always a far less expensive course short and long term. By paying for childbirth but not abortion, the Government increased spending and intruded upon or steered a choice. Roe had ranked as a woman’s fundamental right. The public funding of abortion decisions appear’’—denying a requirement of public funding appear ‘‘incongruous following so soon after the intrepid 1973 ruling. The Court did not adequately explain why the fundamental choice principle and trimester approach embraced in Roe did not bar the sovereign, at least at the previability stage of pregnancy, from taking sides and being required to provide funding for the abortions of poor women.’’
If that writing does not suggest an allegiance to Roe, if that writing does not suggest from her point of view as the author of that article, not only is Roe an important constitutional right, the Government ought to pay for abortions in certain circumstances. If she were here today, and a Democrat President had nominated her, and we take on the role that our colleagues are playing against you, not only would she not have gotten 96 votes, I think she would have been for a very rough experience. And what has changed?
Justice Ginsburg openly expressed a legal theory about Roe v. Wade. My question to you, if I am arguing a case that would alter Roe v. Wade, would I have the ability, because of her prior writings, to ask her to recuse herself based on those writings alone?

Judge ALITO. I don’t think you would, Senator. I think it’s established that prior writings of a member of the judiciary do not require the recusal of that member of the judiciary.
Senator GRAHAM. I think you are absolutely right, Judge. Let me tell you what she said at the hearing when it was her time to sit where you are sitting. ‘‘You asked me about my thinking on equal protection versus individual autonomy. My answer is that both are implicated. The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision that she must make for herself. When Government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.’’
A sentiment that I think our pro-choice colleagues share, a sentiment that I disagree with because I think the decision does affect humanity, and that is the unborn child. I do not question her religion. I do not question her patriotism. She gave an answer that was very honest and was very direct, and pro-life Republicans and pro-life Democrats never thought about disqualifying her. She did not go through what you went through. Pro-life Republicans and pro-life Democrats set her comment aside and judged her based on her whole record and believed she was worthy to sit on the Supreme Court, and she got 96 votes.
And what you have said in your writings about the other side of the issue pales in comparison to what she said before she came to this body.
I don’t know how many votes you are going to get. You are going to get confirmed, and it is not going to be 96. Judge Roberts got 78, and I am afraid to say that you are probably going to get less.
To my colleagues, I know abortion is important. It is important to me, it is important to you. I know it is an important central concept in our jurisprudence. But we can’t build a judiciary around that one issue. We can’t make judges pledge allegiance to one case. We can’t expect them to do things that would destroy their independence. You can vote yes, you vote no. You can use any reason you would like. I just beg my colleagues, let us not go down a road that the country can’t sustain and the judiciary will not be able to tolerate.
People set aside her writing, set aside her candid statement and gave her the benefit of the doubt that she would apply the law when her time came. She replaced Justice White. We knew that that vote was going to change. I don’t think any Republican had any doubt that if there was a Roe v. Wade issue, she would vote differently than Justice White, but you never know.
The one thing I can tell the public about you and John Roberts is that you are first-round NFL draft picks, but I don’t know what you are going to do ten or 20 years from now because I think you are men of great integrity, and I may be very well disappointed in some of your legal reasoning, but I will never be disappointed in you if you do your job as you see it fit.
The last thing I am going to read—do you know Cathy Fleming? Judge ALITO. I do. She was an attorney, a supervisor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in New Jersey. Senator GRAHAM. Did you ask her to write a letter on your behalf?

Judge ALITO. I did not, no. Senator GRAHAM. ‘‘Judge Alito did not ask me to write this letter. I volunteered.’’ [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. I am glad you said that, by the way. [Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM. ‘‘I am a lifelong Democrat. I am the presidentelect of the National Women’s Bar Association. I chair the corporate integrity and the white collar crime group at a national law firm. I do not speak on behalf of either my law firm or the Women’s Bar Association. I speak for myself only. But by providing my credentials as an outspoken women’s rights advocate and liberalminded criminal defense attorney, I hope you will appreciate the significance of my unqualified and enthusiastic recommendation of Sam Alito for the Supreme Court. Sam possesses the best qualities for judges. He is thoughtful. He is brilliant. He is measured. He is serious. And he is conscious of the awesome responsibility imposed by his position. I cannot think of a better quality for a Supreme Court Justice. It is my fervent hope that politics will not prevent this extraordinary capable candidate from serving as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.’’ I share her hope. Thank you. I yield back my time. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Graham. Senator Schumer? Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Judge Alito. First, I want to go over some of the things you said yesterday. Judge Alito, you testified yesterday that you would keep an open mind, isn’t that right? Judge ALITO. I did and I do. Senator SCHUMER. Now, are you aware of any nominee in the history of the Republic who has come before the Senate and testified he would keep a closed mind? Judge ALITO. I am not aware of that, but I can only speak for myself. I will keep an open mind on all issues. Senator SCHUMER. You also testified yesterday that no one, not even the President, is above the law, right? Judge ALITO. That’s certainly true. Senator SCHUMER. Yes. And are you aware of any nominee in the history of this Republic of whatever political philosophy, judicial philosophy, or denomination who has come before the Senate— party denomination—and testified that, actually, there are a few people who are above the law? Judge ALITO. I am not aware of a nominee like that, Senator. Senator SCHUMER. And you also testified that the Court should have respect for the Congress, isn’t that right? Judge ALITO. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. Do you know of any nominees who came before the Senate and said, ‘‘The heck with you guys. I don’t have any respect for the Congress.’’ Judge ALITO. Senator, I can only speak for myself, and those are true expressions of what I think. Senator SCHUMER. I know that, but all I want to say is—and I don’t doubt your sincerity in saying them, but this morning’s news-

papers were filled with headlines to the effect you would keep an open mind. I don’t find that really to be news, nor do I find it very helpful in figuring out what kind of Justice you would be.
My friends on the other side of the aisle have repeatedly said you have answered over 200 questions. Now it is probably 300. But a response is not an answer, and you have responded to more than 300 questions, but in all due respect, you haven’t answered enough of them. So again, I think we ought to make clear that at least to many of us here, we haven’t gotten the answers to questions, yes or no, on some important issues.
With that, I would like to return to Roe, something that we discussed yesterday at some length. You did say yesterday that you would keep an open mind. You said, first, you would look at stare decisis and then you would keep an open mind after going through stare decisis. But when I asked you questions about your prior statements to see if you would keep an open mind so I could make a determination, so the American people could make a determination, you really didn’t answer the question.
Now, we have heard pledges about having an open mind before. I want to read you one. It is another hearing, someone who sat in your chair. ‘‘I have no agenda, Senator. I have tried here as well as in my other endeavors as a judge to remain impartial, to remain open-minded, and I am open-minded on this particular issue.’’ I will bet you can guess who that nominee was, Clarence Thomas on the issue of the Constitution and the right to choose, the very issue I have asked you about, when he sat in that chair 15 years ago.
So someone pledging an open mind doesn’t tell us very much, because I think there were a lot of people on this Committee who were surprised—I wasn’t there—were surprised by how Justice Thomas ruled based on his testimony. He didn’t tell them enough.
Now, yesterday, as you know, I asked you whether you believe today that the Constitution protects the right to an abortion, given that in 1985 you flatly said that it doesn’t, and you didn’t answer that question. Then I asked you whether the Constitution protects the right to free speech, and you said yes. Then I asked, how could you answer one and not the other, and your answer as to why you could discuss one and not the other was essentially that the words ‘‘free speech’’ appear in the Constitution, but that, and this is your words, ‘‘the issue of abortion has to do with the interpretation of certain provisions in the Constitution, the 14th Amendment.’’
Now, Judge Alito, the words ‘‘one person/one vote’’ are not in the Constitution. You know that. And yet you said yesterday, and I think you repeated today to Senator Kohl and maybe Senator Feinstein, as well, but what you said yesterday was, quote, ‘‘I think that one person/one vote is very well settled now in the constitutional law of our country.’’ So you were able to answer on the basis of something as to whether it is settled, not being in the—the words are not in the Constitution.
But you were queried by a few of my colleagues and you had a different explanation. Now, you said you can answer on the other issues because it is settled law. It is not going to come before the Court. So let us go over settled law a little bit.
In case after case, you have been telling us—you have been comfortable telling us that certain cases are settled, and yet you won’t

553
use that word with respect to Roe. You have done it in a host of other cases and issues. I will read a few. ‘‘So I think that one person/one vote is very well settled now in the constitutional law of our history,’’ in response to Senator Kohl. ‘‘The status of independent agencies, I think, is settled in the case law.’’ That was in response to Senator Leahy. ‘‘But I do think that most of those Commerce Clause cases in the years proceeding Lopez, the ones that come to mind, I think, are well-settled precedents,’’ in reference to Senator Feinstein. ‘‘I think the scope of immunity that the attorney has is now settled by Mitchell v. Forsythe and that’s the law.’’
So can you answer the question? Is Roe settled or not? It is less of a concern which way you answer. I would just like you to answer the question. You can say, Roe is not settled. Roe can absolutely be reexamined. I think a lot of people think that is the answer you want to give, but it is controversial and you may not want to give it because it is controversial, even though some of these other issues will come before the Court. Commerce Clause cases will come before the Court. Certain types of one man/one vote cases will come before the Court. Certain types of administrative agencies will come before the Court.
So why is it only when it comes to Roe you can’t tell us whether it is settled, whether it is not settled, or how it is settled, and you can pick any formulation you want. Other judges have commented on Roe being settled. Lindsey Graham pointed out—he is not here, but Ruth Bader Ginsburg talked about her view and she still got a lot of votes on the other side of the aisle. The same might happen to you.
So the question, Judge Alito— [Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. The question, Judge Alito, is why won’t you talk to us about Roe in terms of whether it is settled or not when you will about so many other issues, even issues that would come before the Court? Judge ALITO. The line that I have tried to draw, and I’ve tried to be as forthcoming as I can with the Committee. I’ve tried to provide as many answers as I could, and obviously, I’m speaking here extemporaneously in response to questions. The line that I have tried to draw is between issues that I don’t think realistically will come before the Court, and on those, I feel more freedom to respond. One person/one vote is an example of that— Senator SCHUMER. What about Commerce—sorry to interrupt, but we have limited time. What about Commerce Clause? Raich came to the court a couple of years ago. Raich has roots all the way back in Wickard v. Filburn. You talked about Commerce Clause cases being settled. Judge ALITO. Well, it depends on which Commerce Clause cases you’re talking about. Certainly, the initial Commerce Clause cases that moved away from the pre-New Deal understanding of the Commerce Clause have been on the books for a long time. Maybe I have been more forthcoming than I should have been in some areas, and if that’s the case in providing these extemporaneous answers, I can be faulted for that. But the line that I have to draw, and I think every nominee, including Justice Ginsburg, has drawn, is to say that when it comes to something that realistically could

come before the Court, they can’t answer about how they would decide that question. That would be a disservice to the judicial process.
Senator SCHUMER. I understand your view. I just think there are some inconsistencies there. I would argue you ought to err on the side of being more forthcoming. This is the last chance we and the American people will have to make a decision before a lifetime appointment.
But I want to move on to another issue also related to Roe. Now, you did say that in 1985, you believed that the Constitution did not protect the right to an abortion, and at that time, you were a mature legal mind. You were 35. You were already a Federal prosecutor. You were serving in the Solicitor General’s Office. You had a pretty good understanding of the Constitution. You had argued cases related to Roe before the Supreme Court, I think, 12 times by 1985. So you were a well-seasoned, mature, established legal mind at that time, is that fair to say?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, most of what you said is certainly correct, but I had not argued any case involving Roe before the Supreme Court.
Senator SCHUMER. I see. You had argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court?
Judge ALITO. Yes, that’s correct. Senator SCHUMER. Sorry. Now, let me ask you this. When you wrote that statement, you did not, as we discussed yesterday, when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you had no exceptions. So that would mean, at least in 1985, your view then, there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children, right? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, it was a general statement. It didn’t go into—it didn’t— Senator SCHUMER. But it had no exceptions. You could make that— Judge ALITO. It was one sentence and it certainly didn’t represent—there was no attempt— Senator SCHUMER. You didn’t write any exception for that situation, correct? It just said, the Constitution does not protect. It was without exception. And yesterday, you didn’t argue with me when I mentioned that, without exception. Judge ALITO. I don’t recall you using the word, ‘‘without exception.’’ Senator SCHUMER. I think I did. Judge ALITO. Senator, it’s one—well, I’m not disputing that— Senator SCHUMER. OK. So if you believe— Judge ALITO. Could I just answer that question? Senator SCHUMER. Yes, please. Judge ALITO. It’s one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject. Senator SCHUMER. No, I understand that, but it was a very strong statement. It didn’t talk about any exceptions at all, and the way I read that statement, even if a woman was raped by her father, she would have no constitutional protection to have an abor-

tion and terminate that pregnancy. If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion, that would follow, wouldn’t it?
Judge ALITO. I think the statement speaks for itself, and it’s one sentence and it’s not an effort to set out a comprehensive—
Senator SCHUMER. Well, knowing these examples, do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad, unqualified statement without exception that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, no ands, ifs, or buts is my words, but—
Judge ALITO. What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburgh case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburgh case—
Senator SCHUMER. Right, but you said in the previous sentence of that statement that you personally held those views.
Judge ALITO. That’s correct, but what I was talking about there was the Thornburgh case and nothing more than the Thornburgh case.
Senator SCHUMER. I understand, but you haven’t rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause—
Judge ALITO. What you’ve pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decisionmaking process would have to be gone through. You’d have to know—
Senator SCHUMER. You didn’t think that through in 1985? Judge ALITO. I was not involved in— Senator SCHUMER. When you wrote the statement. When you wrote that statement. Judge ALITO. And when I wrote this statement, what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburgh case, which was to write the memo that the Committee is aware of, which did not argue that Roe should be overruled. It did not argue that the Government should argue that Roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar— Senator SCHUMER. I understand what you wrote, but you also— we can bring the statement up here, but I don’t want to go over the thing of yesterday. I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement, even from 1985, that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. There is not an exception of health to the mother, not an exception of rape or incest, not an exception of any of these others. I didn’t see any of those in your job application. But I want to conclude on one— Judge ALITO. Senator, it was one— Senator SCHUMER. Go ahead, please. Judge ALITO. It was one sentence, and I think what you’re saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account. Senator SCHUMER. In all due respect, sir, I think it highlights the importance of and obligation to discuss it, particularly in light of a strong statement before, but we will have to differ on that. I want to go back to the CAP issue in conclusion, because some of the statements just don’t add up and I just want to try to figure

this out a little better. You graduated from Princeton in 1972. I am just going to state, to save us a little time, a series of facts here. You filled out the application to apply for the job in the Reagan administration in 1985, where you mention membership in that group. Now, is it fair to say you joined sometime around 1972?
Judge ALITO. I think that’s very unlikely. Senator SCHUMER. Unlikely? Judge ALITO. Very unlikely. Senator SCHUMER. When do you—you have no idea when you joined? Judge ALITO. I don’t, but if I had done anything substantial in relation to this, including renewing membership or being a member over a lengthy period of time, I feel confident that I would remember that. Senator SCHUMER. OK. So you don’t remember renewing membership, writing out a check at a certain time, getting a magazine, this Prospect magazine, once a month, once a quarter, once a year? You have no recollection of any of that? Judge ALITO. I don’t. Senator SCHUMER. OK. Well, here is what the—and let me just ask you one other question. I take it in 1985 you were a member of a whole lot of different groups. I mean, you were a member of the Bar Association. You might have been your neighborhood guy, I respect that, maybe a neighborhood association in New Jersey where you lived, maybe other Princeton alumni organizations. In your 1990 application, there are a bunch of other organizations you list as being members of. So you were a member of a whole lot of groups. Judge ALITO. I was a member of some other groups, not a whole lot— Senator SCHUMER. Yes, OK, a bunch. More than two? Judge ALITO. Some other groups, yes. Senator SCHUMER. OK. Here is what I don’t understand. I think here is what a lot of people don’t understand. You are a member of other groups. You hardly have any recollection of this organization. And yet, somehow in 1985, you put it on your application. Why did you? Why did you list that particular organization on your application when you have such vague recollection of it? Why didn’t you put the National Bar Association—I mean, the American Bar Association or one of the other groups that you were a member of? It wasn’t a long list where you were trying to list—you somehow plucked this group, which you now say you have almost no recollection about, and put it on the application, and this group, as we have heard, is controversial. Just try to give us some understanding of your state of mind in 1985, why that group, with its tawdry history even public then, although you said, in all fairness, you didn’t know about it, but why that group? Why was it plucked out and put on the application? Judge ALITO. Well, I deplore all of those statements that were shown on the chart. Senator SCHUMER. Understood. Judge ALITO. I would never associate myself with those statements—

Senator SCHUMER. What made you pick that group? I understand. I am not trying to—
Judge ALITO. I think you have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out. I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration, and my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position. I mentioned some very minor political contributions. I didn’t mention contributions to charitable organizations, and that’s not because the contributions to charitable organizations were unimportant. It’s just that—
Senator SCHUMER. Can you reach back, because it is an important issue now—it has become one—and try to figure out your state of mind then and what made you pick this organization. What did you—I mean, I see why you picked the Federalist Society. That is obvious. Why did you pick this one?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, since I don’t remember this organization, I can’t answer your question specifically, but I think that the answer to the question lies in the nature of the form that I was filling out and the things that I put. I think the illustration of the political contributions goes right to the point. Why did I mention small political contributions and not charitable contributions?
Senator SCHUMER. Can I ask you— Judge ALITO. It wasn’t that the charitable contributions were less important. It was that they were not as relevant to obtaining a political position. Senator SCHUMER. Why didn’t you put it on your application in 1990? It wasn’t there. Judge ALITO. I didn’t remember it. Senator SCHUMER. But you remembered it from 1972, or whenever you joined, to 1985, formed in 1972. Why I think you probably joined earlier is because of what you said about ROTC, which is a much bigger issue in its early history than its later history. And you remember that. You remember it up until 1985, and then by 1990, you had forgotten it. Let me just say, I am glad—this is by way of explanation. That is why Senator Kennedy made his request. I am glad, Senator Specter, that you have acceded to it. I think there are unanswered questions here that we really have an obligation to answer, and maybe the documents we get will give us some of those answers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge ALITO. Senator, I have— Senator SCHUMER. Please. Judge ALITO. I have told the Committee everything that I can about this organization, and the most important thing I want to tell the Committee is that I have no association with those comments that were made, even if they were made in letters to the editor or in articles that simply represented the views of the authors of those articles. They are not my views now. They never were my views. They represent things that I deplore. I have always deplored any form of racial discrimination or bigotry. I was never opposed to the admission of women to Princeton. After I had been there for a few months, I realized the difference between the non-coeducational atmosphere that was there and the coeducational atmos-

phere that I had had throughout my prior schooling. When it came time for me to join an eating facility, I chose one that was one of the most coeducational facilities on the campus.
Senator SCHUMER. I just can’t figure out why you put this group on here.
Chairman SPECTER. Senator Schumer, your time is up, Senator Schumer.
Senator Cornyn? Senator CORNYN. Judge Alito, let me tell you how desperate your opponents are to defeat your nomination. Late last Wednesday—or, excuse me, last Thursday, a name of a witness was listed relative to this whole issue of Concerned Alumni of Princeton that included the name of a man named Stephen Dujak. Is that name familiar to you? Judge ALITO. Not other than from seeing the witness list. Senator CORNYN. Well, by the end of the day on Friday, his name was gone from the witness list of those witnesses intended to be called by the other party. As it turned out, it was revealed that in April of 2003, that he had authored an op-ed piece for the Los Angeles Times entitled, ‘‘Animals Suffer a Perpetual Holocaust,’’ and in that article, he wrote this. He said, ‘‘Like the victims of the Holocaust, animals are rounded up, trucked hundreds of miles to the kill floor, and slaughtered. Comparisons to the Holocaust are not only appropriate but inescapable, because whether we wish to admit it or not, cows, chickens, pigs, and turkeys are capable of feeling loneliness, fear, pain, joy, and affection as we are. To those who defend the modern-day Holocaust on animals by saying that animals are slaughtered for food to give us sustenance, I ask if the victims of the Holocaust had been eaten, would that have justified the abuse and murder? Did the fact that lamp shades, soaps, and other useful products were made from their bodies excuse the Holocaust? No. Pain is pain.’’ Judge Alito, I read that to point out to you the desperation of your opponents. This was to be a principal witness who was going to come in and say why your membership in Concerned Alumni of Princeton was a terrible thing. But the fact is that I think they have stumbled by their overreaching by demonstrating the desperation that they feel and how few ways they have to criticize your testimony, your career, your integrity, and who you are as a person based upon the facts and I think it speaks volumes. It is clear to me, at least, that part of the reasonings or the rationale given for a ‘‘no’’ vote against you by some on this Committee and perhaps on the floor of the Senate will be that you have not been responsive to questions. We have a chart here that I think is instructive. This is as of 3 p.m. on day two. We couldn’t get any more current than that. But as this indicates, so far in this hearing, 441 questions have been asked and 431 have been answered, or 98 percent. Justice Ginsburg, and we have heard a lot about her and what she would answer and would not answer and what her philosophy was, her beliefs, before she was confirmed by the Senate with only three votes against, she had 384 questions asked and she answered 307 of those for an 80 percent answer rate. You know, listening to the back and forth about whether you have been responsive to questions reminds me of a saying that I

heard recently: ‘‘I can answer the question, but I can’t understand it for you.’’
In other words, I think you have done, to the best of your ability and to the limits of your ethical responsibility, tried to be responsive to the questions here. Obviously, no one can make that decision but the Senators who will ultimately vote on that. But certainly the public and the world, people all across this great country who may be listening to this hearing and will be judging for themselves both the fairness of the proceeding and your responsiveness to the questions, I believe that they will conclude that not only have you been responsive but that you have been very forthcoming in answering the questions that have been asked of you, but that, like Justice Ginsburg and others before her, you believe that it is important to maintain the independence of the judiciary, that you are not willing to make the judiciary subservient to the Senate or the Congress in order to get a vote for confirmation. And I applaud you for that.
You know, yesterday I made a mistake. I know Senator Sessions confessed a mistake and, as it turned out, I went over and talked to Senator Biden because I had quoted him and it turned out I didn’t quite quote him accurately. But I told him we have corrected the record to make sure it reflected his words, because it is important to me to make sure that we are accurate and we are clear.
But yesterday I made a mistake and referred to you as Judge Scalito. And I was embarrassed by that, and I asked your—begged your pardon for that. For those that may not be in on the joke, the idea is, the argument by some is somehow you are a clone of Judge Scalia. Well, I have found for myself everything we have heard, everything I have come to learn about you is that you are a clone of no one, that you are an individual who is particularly gifted and talented and experienced and someone who has been, notwithstanding the abuse that you suffer during the confirmation process, willing to offer yourself for public service in a very important role, and that is as a member of the United States Supreme Court.
But yesterday my colleague from New York put up some quotes. Now, it was late in the day and I think most of the press had gone—and maybe that is a good thing. People had gotten tired, but you had to still sit here and listen to the questions and respond to those. But he put up a quote, which was relatively innocuous on its face, and it asked about things like do you believe that continuity in the law is important. And you said yes and it seems unarguable to me. But then he said, well, that was a quote from Clarence Thomas. And I suppose that was going to attribute to you all of the baggage that those on the left feel that Justice Thomas carries and all of the views that he has espoused and all of his performance on the bench.
Later, he asked whether you agreed with another quote, and here again it was a sort of black-letter law, good-government quote. And you agreed that, yes, you agreed with that quote. And he said, Ah-ha, Judge Bork said that. Meaning somehow that you were carrying whatever baggage people on the left feel that Judge Bork carries and you somehow embrace or subscribe to everything he believes.

I want to give you an opportunity, Judge Alito, to tell us whether you feel like you are a clone of Judge Scalia, Judge Thomas, Judge Bork, or whether you believe that you are your own man, you come to your own conclusions based on careful study and your experience in the law. Would you comment on that for me, please?
Judge ALITO. Yes, Senator. I am who I am and I’m my own person. And I’m not like any other Justice on the Supreme Court now or anybody else who served on the Supreme Court in the past. I don’t think any jurist is a duplicate of any other jurist. I think that the Committee and anybody who’s interested in the sort of judge I am can get a very clear picture of that by looking at my record on the court of appeals. And I’ve been on the court of appeals for 15 years and have sat on over 4,000 cases. And most of the cases that come to the court of appeals never go any further. We’re the last stop in 99 percent of the cases, probably higher than that. And we know that when we’re deciding those cases.
And I think if anybody reads the opinions that I’ve written and the opinions that I’ve joined, they can see exactly the sort of jurist that I am. They will find some opinions I’m sure that they will disagree with. But if they look at the whole set of opinions that I’ve written or joined, they can get a very clear picture of me. I’m not like anybody else. I don’t claim to have the abilities of some of the distinguished members of the Supreme Court now or in the past. I have my—whatever abilities that I have. But they are my own.
Senator CORNYN. Let me tell you what Cass Sunstein has said about you. You may be familiar with the op-ed piece that was written in the Akron Beacon Journal on November 3, 2005. This is— of course, you know Professor Sunstein from the University of Chicago, a brilliant and liberal legal scholar. But he concludes in this op-ed—and this is how he describes you based upon his review of your life’s work as a judge.
He said, ‘‘Alito sits on a liberal court’’—and this is an analysis of your dissents. ‘‘Alito sits on a liberal court, so his dissents can be from relatively liberal rulings. None of Alito’s opinions is reckless or irresponsible or especially far-reaching. His disagreement is unfailingly respectful. His dissents are lawyerly rather than bombastic. He does not berate his colleagues. Alito does not place political ideology at the forefront. He doesn’t claim an ambitious or controversial theory of interpretation. He avoids abstraction. He’s not endorsed the view associated with Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas that the Constitution should be interpreted to fit with the original understanding of those who ratified it. Several of his opinions insist on careful attention to governing legal text, but that approach is perfectly legitimate, to say the least.’’
Judge Alito, I think it is important for people listening to understand that you are indeed your own man and that you do the very best job that you can with the skills and the talents that God has given you, and that you are willing to serve, and we ought to applaud you for that. And it is really, to me, demeaning to suggest some sort of guilt by association or that you must be a clone of some other judge or someone who outside groups hold up to disrespect and ridicule.
So I hope that, as I say, those listening, both in the Senate and outside, will make up their mind about you based upon the evi-

dence that we have heard and that is available and not based on those sort of specious comparisons.
Now, let me ask—you know, believing as I do that you have been responsive, and expecting as I do that those who vote against you will claim that you have been nonresponsive notwithstanding the chart I showed you and your willingness to respond to the questions, you know, Senator Schumer—who is an enormously talented and very bright lawyer in his own right—was pressing you on whether Roe v. Wade is settled. And, I’ve really tried to analyze for myself, when is it that judges and nominees are willing to go out on a limb, so to speak, and say, yes, that’s settled law or to talk more expansively about an issue; and when is it that they feel less comfortable, less free, more constrained by their ethical obligations or their desire to preserve the independence of the judiciary?
And what I have concluded—and I would like to get your reaction to this—is the more settled, to use the word Senator Schumer has, the more accepted in the society, in our culture, the more free nominees feel to talk about it; but the more a nominee feels like this is an issue that not only is going to come back, it is going to come back soon—as a matter of fact, it may be on the Court’s docket now—the less free, the more bound by your ethical obligations you feel, the more you feel it is important to preserve your independence as a judge.
And we have mentioned a couple of them—Brown v. Board of Education, which expresses a commitment to equal justice under the law that all Americans embrace, virtually speaking. You have felt free to express a view on that case, have you not, sir?
Judge ALITO. I have. The line I’ve tried to draw is whether something realistically could come up in litigation before the court of appeals or before the Supreme Court. And I—
Senator CORNYN. Does that mean that you don’t expect Brown v. Board of Education to be attacked, or someone to come before the Court and ask that it be overruled?
Judge ALITO. I don’t. There’s no realistic possibility of that, so I felt freer to talk about something like that.
Senator CORNYN. But you do believe, and I think with good cause, that there will be continuous attempts to address the abortion issue because of its divisive nature and because Americans are so divided on that issue, or at least some aspect of the issue. To what extent, for example, can the Congress pass laws which ban the barbaric practice of partial birth abortion, to what extent can Congress or the States pass laws that provide for minors to seek— requiring them to seek parental—or provide their parents notice, with an appropriate judicial bypass for those who are abused or neglected or abandoned by their parents? That is an issue that is at the forefront of America’s consciousness and really, I think, sort of the subtext under which a lot of the wars over judicial nominations are fought. Would you agree with that, more or less?
Judge ALITO. It’s an issue that is in litigation now, and I think you can look at the course of litigation over the past 20 years and you can see a number of cases—and of course this has been highlighted—in which the Supreme Court has been asked to overrule Roe and it has repeatedly refused to do that. But there’s nothing—

562
there’s no comparable pattern, for example, with respect to Brown v. Board of Education or one person, one vote.
Senator CORNYN. Well, in the closing two and a half minutes that I have, I mentioned the Cass Sunstein op-ed, which, from my reading, even though I am sure you and Professor Sunstein don’t see eye-to-eye on all legal issues, he seems to be highly complimentary of you, is the way I interpreted those two paragraphs I read out of the op-ed piece.
Now, a national newspaper, the Washington Post, on January 1st—that is the Washington Post, not National Review—did an analysis of your voting record on the Third Circuit. They found that in virtually every type of case, whether labor, employment—your record was no different than the average Republican-appointed judge. And to me, that is sort of the—said another way, that means that you are within the conservative mainstream in terms of your judicial philosophy.
Now, I know that you and other legal scholars have some trouble with this approach by political scientists to try to survey your opinions and categorize them and say, well, this is who you are, because you don’t decide cases that way, do you? You decide individual cases based upon the legal arguments, the merits, and the facts. Isn’t that correct, sir?
Judge ALITO. That’s right, and it would be a bad thing if judges started keeping these scorecards and said, oh, I’ve ruled a certain number of times in favor of one side; when the next case comes up, I’d better rule on the other side. That’s exactly what we don’t want judges to do.
Senator CORNYN. You anticipated my next question, and that would be if somehow it disqualifies you because of how political scientists have somehow ranked your sympathy with certain types of cases, how often you have ruled in favor of one type of litigant and another—as opposed to an individual case-by-case decisionmaking process contemplated by the Constitution—I doubt it will be long before prospective nominees to the Federal judiciary will be keeping that kind of chart. And when litigants come into court, they are going to be tempted to look at that and say, well, I’ve ruled for too many plaintiffs, I’d better rule for a defendant this time. Or, no, I’ve shown too much sympathy for civil rights plaintiffs, I’d better rule for the government this time. Which would totally skew your responsibility as a Federal judge, in my view.
Judge Alito, my time has run out. Thank you for your response to my questions.
Judge ALITO. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. We will take now another break for 15 minutes. I have had requests from two Senators on the Democratic side for a third round. We have three more Senators to question on the 20-minute round— Senator LEAHY. We have several more than the two. Chairman SPECTER. Well, Senator Leahy, that is what I would like to ascertain so that we can figure out the schedule for the balance of the evening. We have 1 hour more for three Senators at 20 minutes; I want to figure out what we are going to do the rest of the evening. I want to figure out when we are going to bring on

the outside witnesses who are available tomorrow. So if there are other requests, I would like to have them.
But now we will stand in recess until 5:55. [Recess 5:40 p.m. to 5:55 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will proceed now to the last three Senators who have not had a second round of 20 minutes—Senator Durbin, Senator Brownback and Senator Coburn. As I had mentioned before, I have had requests from two Senators for a third round. Senator Leahy advises that there are others and I would like the specifications. Senator Biden is prepared to proceed—has requested 20 minutes and is prepared to proceed. Senator Feinstein has requested 10 minutes and she has a doctor’s appointment, so she won’t be able to be here this evening, and we will accommodate her on that. But I would like to know who else wants time so we can plan what we are going to do for the balance of the evening and hereafter. I have had requests on my side of the aisle as to whether we are having a Friday session and I have had a request as to whether we are having a Saturday session. And I told both of those requestors to stand by. And I do piecework, so I am here for the duration. Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I have been told that each one of the people on this side want another round. I know I want to look at the transcript this evening and I will have a few more questions. Obviously, you can do what you want. Judge Alito has shown that he has the stamina of Hercules. I am not sure that all the rest of us do. Senator Coats is hanging in there, but he is able to bail out now and then. I would suggest you finish with the Senators who are here tonight. That would get us out of here around seven or a little later; come back in the morning. This is very similar to what we did with Chief Justice Roberts. Come back in the morning, and I have a feeling that whatever rounds it takes, we would probably wrap it up in relatively expeditious order. But then we wouldn’t be looking like we are trying to ram this through. It is a lifetime appointment, after all. We get it done. I think most of the outside witnesses have been told that they were going to testify on Friday, anyway, in all likelihood. That is my suggestion. Chairman SPECTER. Well, that is not true. There are people who can’t be here on Friday among the outside witnesses who were looking at Thursday. Senator LEAHY. Well, who knows? We will probably be wrapped up in time so that we can leave here sometime Thursday. Chairman SPECTER. Well, Senator Leahy— Senator LEAHY. It is up to you. Chairman SPECTER [continuing]. The only way we will know what is going to happen—I want to know who wants more time so I can see what is going to go on tomorrow, if we are going to go beyond Senator Feinstein tomorrow. We had this exact same situation with Chief Justice Roberts and we worked on into Wednesday evening and then we got an understanding as to what we were going to do on Thursday.

Senator LEAHY. Well, we are into Wednesday evening now already, so I mean we have done—
Chairman SPECTER. Well, why don’t we proceed with our few witnesses so as not to spend any more time, and if I could have the advice from you—
Senator LEAHY. Sure. Chairman SPECTER.—Senator Leahy, and from Senator Kennedy. Senator Durbin has 20 minutes. He probably has more time than he needs. Senator LEAHY. I have yet to find a situation in this Committee, Mr. Chairman, when you and I haven’t been able to work things out because you have always been eminently fair. Chairman SPECTER. OK. Well, to put all the cards on the table, the only compelling force, if there such a thing as a compelling force for Senators, is to figure out how to avoid working this evening by telling me what you want to do tomorrow. That is a fairly simple formula. Senator LEAHY. Who was the Leader, Mr. Chairman, who once said moving the Senate around was like transporting bull frogs in a wheel barrow? Chairman SPECTER. Senator Baker, who is author of the ‘‘herding cats.’’ Senator Durbin, you are recognized for 20 minutes. Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much. And, Judge Alito, if I am not mistaken, this is how we started the day. I think we are now into about eight-and-a-half hours, which means we are both on overtime by any measurable workplace standard in America. Thank you for your endurance, and to your family as well. I know it is a stressful and tough situation. Let me say at the outset I asked you a question earlier today about settled law and John Roberts’s statement before the Committee. I have spoken to one of your corner men over here, Ed Gillespie, and he and I have a difference of opinion about what it says in the record. I commend to my colleagues the record itself, September 13, 2005, page 145, and I stand by my earlier statement. Enough said about that. I want to ask you about two substantive issues. We are not going to go to Princeton or any other place. The unitary Executive: the reason it is important is that there are some people even on the Supreme Court who believe the unitary Executive theory—and I don’t know if it is always associated with the Federalist Society, but sometimes associated with the Federalist Society and their members—but the unitary Executive theory gives a President extraordinary power. And under that theory, some argue that a President, particularly in a wartime situation, can ignore and violate laws as Commander in Chief—critically important and timely as we debate eavesdropping and the like. You have made it clear that when you spoke to the Federalist Society in 2000, you were not talking about scope of the President’s power, but you were talking instead as to whether or not he would have control over the executive branch. I hope I am characterizing your statement correctly. Judge ALITO. That is exactly correct, and I think in the speech I said there is a debate about the scope of what is meant by the
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00576 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.002 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

565
Executive power, but there isn’t any debate that the President has the power to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and that was the scope of the power that I was discussing.
Senator DURBIN. So my question to you is this: What about those who do argue the unitary Executive scope theory? Do you agree with their analysis, do you disagree? Would you be joining Justice Thomas, in particular, in his dissent in Hamdi—in arguing that in this situation a President has more power than the law expressly gives him?
Judge ALITO. I don’t think that the unitary Executive has anything to do with that. Let me just say that at the outset. I think that—and if other people use that term to mean the scope of Executive power, that certainly isn’t the way that I understand—
Senator DURBIN. That is not your point of view? Judge ALITO. That is not my point of view. Senator DURBIN. You don’t accept that point of view? Judge ALITO. No. I think— Senator DURBIN. If an argument is made that that is how they are going to expand the power of the President, as you testify today, that is not your position or your feeling? Say it in your own words. Judge ALITO. It is not my—the unitary—when I talk about the unitary Executive, I am talking about the President’s control over the Executive branch, no matter how big or how small, no matter how much power it has or how little power it has. To me, the issue of the scope of Executive power is an entirely different question and it goes to what can you read into simply the term ‘‘Executive.’’ That is part of it and, of course, there are some other powers that are given to the President in Article II, the commander in chief power, for example. And there can be a debate, of course, about the scope of that power, but that doesn’t have to do with the unitary Executive. Senator DURBIN. So when Hamdi draws that line and Justice O’Connor makes that statement about no blank check for a President in times of war when it comes to the rights of American citizens, and there is a dissent from Justice Thomas, who argues unitary Executive, scope of powers, more power to the President, you are coming down on the majority side and not on the Thomas side of that argument. Is that fair to say? Judge ALITO. Well, I am not coming down—I don’t recall that Justice Thomas uses the term ‘‘unitary Executive’’ in his dissent. It doesn’t stick out in my mind that he did. If he did, he is using it there in a sense that is different from the sense in which I was using the term. Senator DURBIN. Fair enough. Let me move to another area. I hate to return to that infamous 1985 memo, but there is one element of it we have really not asked you about, and that is your reference to the Establishment Clause. So instead of going into that memo, let me just try to explore with you for a moment your feelings about religion in our diverse society and under the Constitution. You have heard some questions from the other side about it from Senator Brownback, Senator Cornyn and others, and I would like to try to get into this a little bit.

There seems to be a debate within the Court between two standards for judging conduct as to whether it is constitutional in relation to freedom of exercise of religion, as well as establishment. And the two theories, if I can describe them quickly, are the Lemon theory which has three tests that the Burger Court came out with in 1971 and the new coercion theory.
Are you familiar with both of those theories? Judge ALITO. I am, and there is actually a third theory, the endorsement test. Senator DURBIN. Where do you come down? Do you subscribe to any one of those as an accurate analysis of what the Founding Fathers meant under the Establishment Clause? Judge ALITO. I don’t think the Court has settled on any single theory that it applies in every case. There are cases in which it finds the Lemon theory, the Lemon test, which now has two parts, whether the statute has—whether whatever is at issue has a secular purpose and whether the primary effect is to advance or inhibit religion. There are instances in which it applies that. It tends to apply that in cases involving funding. There is the endorsement test, and it applies that in certain cases. Typically, it applies those in cases involving things like the displaying of symbols that may have religious—that have religious significance. So it itself has not found a single test that it applies in all of these cases. Senator DURBIN. Well, where are you? If the Court is divided, and it appears it is, where do you come down? I mean, do you— please tell me. Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t have a—I do not myself have a grand, unified theory of the Establishment Clause. As a lower court judge, of course, my job has been to apply those precedents, and this is an area in which I think the Court has been—you can just see by the number of cases that it has decided it has been attempting to find the best way of expressing its view of what the Establishment Clause requires. I certainly agree that it embodies a very important principle and one that has been instrumental in allowing us to live together successfully as probably the most religiously diverse country in the world, and maybe in the history of the world. And it’s a very important principle, but I myself do not have a grand, unified theory of this. Senator DURBIN. Let me ask you a few starting points. The question was asked of John Roberts about his personal religious and moral belief. And I would ask you in the most open-ended fashion. We all come to our roles in life with life experience and with values. When you are calculating and making a decision, if you were on the Supreme Court, tell me what role your personal religious or moral beliefs will play in that decision process. Judge ALITO. Well, my personal religious beliefs are important to me in my private life. They are an important part of the way I was raised and they have been important to Martha and me in raising our children. But my obligation as a judge is to interpret and apply the Constitution and the laws of the United States, and not my personal religious beliefs or any personal moral beliefs that I have, and there is nothing about my religious beliefs that interferes with

567
my doing that. I have a particular role to play as a judge and that does not involve imposing any religious views that I have or moral views that I have on the rest of the country.
Senator DURBIN. That is virtually the same answer given by Justice Roberts and I think from my point of view that is the right answer. It is the same challenge many of us face on this side of the table with decisions that we face.
Now, I asked Judge Roberts the following: Does the Free Exercise Clause, in addition to the Establishment Clause, protect the right of a person to be respected in America if they have no religious beliefs, the non-believers?
Judge ALITO. Yes, it does. It is freedom to worship and not worship, as you choose, and compelling somebody to worship would be a clear violation of the religion clauses of the First Amendment.
Senator DURBIN. Let me go to a specific case, the Black Horse Pike Regional Board of Education case, in which you were involved. And it is an interesting case and I hope this fact pattern that I describe to you is correct.
The school board policy allowed the seniors at this school to vote on having a graduation prayer, and the decision, it was suggested, was whether that was coercing students who didn’t agree with that religious prayer or had no religious belief.
What is your feeling, or what was your feeling at that time when it came to that decision?
Judge ALITO. Well, that was the case that followed Lee v. Weisman and preceded the Santa Fe case, which dealt with a prayer before a football game. Lee v. Weisman involved a situation in which the principal—and that was the most directly relevant and a rather recent precedent at the time of the Black Horse Pike case.
In Lee v. Weisman, the principal of a middle school, as I recall, decided that there would be an invocation at the middle school graduation, and selected a member of the clergy, a local rabbi, to deliver the prayer and specified the nature of the prayer that would be appropriate for the circumstances. And the Supreme Court held that that was a violation of the Establishment Clause.
The case that we considered in the Black Horse Pike case involved a situation in which the high school left it up to the students through an election to decide whether there would be a prayer at the high school graduation and left it up to them to select the person who would conduct the prayer, the student who would lead them in the prayer, if that was—if they decided by a vote to do that.
And so our job at that point was to decide whether this fell on one side or the other of a line that I referred to earlier which Justice O’Connor very helpfully—the distinction that she drew between government religious speech, which is not allowed, and private religious speech which is protected. The government itself cannot speak on religious matters, but the government also can’t discriminate against private religious speech. And we had here a situation—
Senator DURBIN. That goes back to the Oliva case where the student comes up with the drawing of Jesus, and that is a voluntary, personal and private expression, as you have described it.

568
Judge ALITO. That is correct, and the Supreme Court has recognized this in any number of cases. In the Rosenberger case and the Good News Club case and the Lamb’s Chapel case, they have drawn this distinction.
So here we had a situation involving an election by the students to pick somebody to lead them in prayer, and which side of the line did it fall on? Well, it wasn’t individual student speech, but it was collective student speech by way of an election. And that was what we had to decide, which side of this line it fell on. And Judge Mansmann, who wrote the opinion that I joined in that case, explained why we thought it fell on the side of the line of individual student speech.
Senator DURBIN. Let me ask you about that. Let me explore for a second. You are dealing with a school board policy. A school board is a government agency. They have set up the policy, so it is not coming entirely from a voluntary personal situation, like the Oliva case. And you know that the majority is going to rule in the decision on whether there will be a prayer and what the substance of the prayer will be.
How, then, could you respect the rights of the minority, including people with different religious beliefs and non-believers, if you leave it up to a majority vote?
Judge ALITO. Well, that is why—that factor is why it was a case that didn’t—there could be debate about which side of this line it fell on. Now, I think there also was a disclaimer that was distributed at the time of the graduation explaining to anybody who was in attendance that the prayer was not endorsed—if there was a prayer, it wasn’t endorsed by the school board, and that this was a decision of the students.
There are factors there that fall on one side of the line. There are factors there that point to the case being put on one side of that line, factors that point to putting the case on the other side of the line. And Judge Mansmann’s opinion explained why she thought, and I agree, that it would fall on the private student speech side of the line. But it was a question that was debatable.
And then the Sante Fe case came along later. It didn’t involved exactly the same situation, but it involved a related situation, and that is now the Supreme Court’s expression of its opinion in the form of a precedent on the application to—the application of this test that I have been talking about, a situation like this.
Senator DURBIN. As you have described it, this is not an easy call. There are circumstances on both sides, and yet in your dissent you use the phrase referring to the majority as ‘‘hostility toward religion.’’ It seems to me that you could make a case that I am not hostile toward religion, but trying to be sensitive to the rights of all to believe or not to believe in America and come down on the opposite side of the case.
Were you overstating your position in using that phrase ‘‘hostility toward religion’’ in describing the majority?
Judge ALITO. That was—it was Judge Mansmann’s opinion, in which I joined, and I don’t remember the phrase ‘‘hostility to religion.’’ Obviously, it must be in there. I certainly don’t think that she meant to suggest that those who were objecting to this were proceeding in bad faith, or even that they were hostile to religion.

I think what she—I can’t speak for her and I don’t recall the specific language, but looking at it now, the way I would put it was that she probably thought that this was not giving as much room for private religious speech as should be given.
Senator DURBIN. I couldn’t tell you what in the heck I ever wrote in law school about anything, but in the second year in law school you wrote a paper, I take it, some research, which you had to tell us about here relative to the issue of religion, and then in the 1985 memo raised the question about the Warren Court on the Establishment Clause.
What was it that the Warren Court decided on the Establishment Clause that troubled you, if you remember?
Judge ALITO. Well, I actually think that the student note from the Yale Law Journal is an illustration of the sort of thing that has interested me and troubled me about the jurisprudence in this area for a long time.
In the law school note, I talked about two—what are called the release time cases. It was the McCollum case and Zorach v. Clausen, both of which were decided just before Chief Justice Warren took his seat. And they involved situations that were quite similar. There was a distinction between the two programs, but they were quite similar and the Court reached contrary conclusions.
And unfortunately this has been a repeating—a recurring pattern in the Establishment Clause jurisprudence, cases that turn on extremely fine distinctions. The Supreme Court held in Board of Education v. Allen, if I am remembering the correct case, at the end of the Warren Court that it was permissible for a school board to supply secular books to schools that are related to a religious— that are religiously oriented. And then later in another case—I think it was Wolman—they said but you can’t—but that doesn’t apply to other instructional material, other secular instructional material.
And this has been the thing about the Establishment Clause that has bothered me, the absence of just what your initial question was pointing to, some sort of theory that draws distinctions that don’t turn on these very fine lines.
Senator DURBIN. Tell me about the Establishment Clause in a more contemporary context if you can. You talked about the case of the Warren Court in providing secular books to religious schools, which I find no problem with. I think that is acceptable from my point of view, for whatever that is worth.
But what about the concept and theory of financial support from a government agency to a school that is a religious school where the money is used for the purpose of teaching religion or proselytizing?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think the Court’s precedents have been very clear on that that the money—that a government body cannot supply money to a school for the purpose of conducting religious education. And I don’t recall any—I don’t recall a suggestion in dissenting opinions—maybe there is one that I am not recalling here that says that that would be permissible.
Senator DURBIN. I am running out of time, but it would go back to my first question. I think under the coercion test, there is some argument among some on the Court and others that not applying

Lemon but using this new coercion test may give them more leeway when it comes to this kind of financial support and vouchers, but I don’t want to presume that.
And I thank you for your responses to these questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Durbin. Senator Brownback. Senator BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We started off this morning and we will end today. I want to thank you for all the questions you have answered. You have answered the questions that I have had, and I have heard much of the rest of the discussion. I think we have covered many of these points so many multiple times. We have just overdone it on some of these. So, Mr. Chairman, I am satisfied with the questions that he has answered. I will be supporting your nomination in front of the Committee and on the floor. I think you are an outstanding nominee, and I have appreciated your thoughts that you have put forward here. I think if approved—and I hope you are, and I think you will be approved by the full Senate—you are going to serve as an outstanding Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. And I will be supporting you here in the Committee and on the floor, and with that, Mr. Chairman, I would yield back my time. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Brownback, thank you. Thank you for 19 minutes and 6 seconds. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Coburn? Senator COBURN. Well, Mr. Chairman, I will give you some time back, but it won’t be quite that much. Thank you. I have a couple of charts I want to show just to clarify the record. I want to again make sure everybody knows that in 1985, there is a quote in the Princeton Packet, the campaign to eliminate the Army ROTC program and what was perceived as the decline of Princeton athletics, it was also known that this CAP program was soliciting through mail membership and support. There also was a disclaimer in this that I want to make sure is in the record as well, and it says, ‘‘The appearance of an article in Prospect does not necessarily represent an endorsement of the author’s belief by the Concerned Alumni of Princeton. CAP has never taken a formal stand on coeducation at Princeton or elsewhere.’’ And I liken that to—I am a member of the American Medical Association, but I will tell you, I don’t agree with everything that is written in JAMA. As a matter of fact, I take great, great umbrage at some of the things that are written there and some of the ideas that are put forward that aren’t done well, that go counter to good medicine, but that doesn’t mean I endorse—because I am a member of the American Medical Association, because I am a member of JAMA, it doesn’t mean that I endorse everything that that organization or that magazine might put out. And so I think Senator Graham had it right. You know, this idea of association with anything means that you take it all, whether, in fact, that is the truth or not, and that is not good work on this Committee, and it is not truthful, and it is not intellectually honest.

I want to spend just a few minutes going back. You had mentioned earlier about one of the things the Court didn’t do is they can’t take necessarily all the technology or all the science and how it applies to things, and that things, in fact, might change. And I mentioned earlier this morning in our questions about the Stenberg case and the Doe v. Bolton and this concept of health, and that one of the things as a practicing physician who has delivered 4,000 babies, who also had a grandmother who came into this world as a result of rape—so I have a special view on the consequences of rape—this concept of health, I am interested in your thought on it, because one of the things I think about it is the health of the woman when? At the time or later? Because of what we do know about the consequences of Roe v. Wade and the actual act of abortion and the impact that that has on a woman’s health.
For example, you are twice as likely to commit suicide if you have had an abortion. Now a study, a longitudinal study shows that. Twice as likely to have alcohol or drug dependency if you have had an abortion. About 60 percent more likely to have a preterm delivery.
So as the Court looks at that and also looks at the fact—this health question, then also looks at health and then also looks at viability—when I was in medical school it was unusual for a preterm infant at 28, 29, 30 weeks to survive. And we routinely see infants at 24 weeks that survive. As a matter of fact, I have a nephew 24-, 25-week delivery. The only deficit he has is he is blind in one eye. He weighed 1 pound 2 ounces when he was born.
And so technology means something, and so the fact that we are not going to commit to give a blanket answer—and I am convinced that the only way you will get certain votes off this Committee and out of the Senate is if you were to write a blood oath that there is nothing that could interrupt any type of abortion on demand at any time.
So my question to you is: How is it that the courts should—any court should take into consideration these questions about technology and science and how they impact the law? And the other thing I would add to that—and I mentioned it in my opening statement—is we consider somebody alive when they have a heartbeat and brain wave. And we consider them dead when they don’t have those things. And how is it that the court can’t look at that science and say we have a heartbeat and a brain wave, we know when viability is now outside of the womb, should those factors play in the decision of the court, or just we just blanket stare decisis and say Roe and Casey, it is all settled, and we are not going to look at the science? Should that play a role?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I guess I would answer that by saying that you would have to—you would look at the factors that are relevant under the stare decisis analysis and ask the role of the sort of data that you have outlined, ask how that would be involved in the factors that go into the stare decisis analysis. And then if you get past that to the second step, of course, you would ask the same question whether—what bearing that information has on the resolution of the question at that step.
Just speaking in general, not talking about abortion at all, in general, in deciding any legal issue, I think courts should be recep-

572
tive to any information that has a bearing on the decisions that they are making. There is no such thing in general as bad knowledge, and I think that is relevant to the decisionmaking process that judges go through. They should be receptive to information that is relevant, that the parties want to bring to their attention, and then decide how it figures in the application of the legal standards that they are applying in the particular case.
Senator COBURN. Let me ask you another question, and I want you to be careful how you answer this because I think at some time this probably will come before you, and I am not trying to get you pinned down. If I am driving a car today and I hit a pregnant woman who has a 36-, 37-week fetus, and the woman survives and the fetus dies, I can be held accountable for the death of that fetus. And by law, we value that as a life—unborn but a life.
If I am the pregnant woman and say I want to terminate that fetus at 37 weeks, there is nothing in this country today that keeps me from doing that, even though on one side of the law we say it is a life.
How did we get there to where it is not a life or it is a life? Tell me, somebody logically explain that to the American people that how if I kill it, it was a life, but if I choose to take it voluntarily, it is not a life. Can anybody logically explain how we got there and what the consequences going down the road are going to be for us as a Nation when we have laws that send two completely different signals about the same individual?
Judge ALITO. Well, let me try to just explain my understanding of where the law rests on those two questions. The first is a question of tort law, or maybe it is a question of—well, it is a question of tort law, and decisions are made by State legislatures. Maybe in some instances it comes about through the development of common law through the State courts regarding the scope of State tort law and protection—a tort can be created that applies in the situation of the auto accident you mentioned or a legislature may choose to structure the tort law differently. But that has been a decision that has been left for the State legislatures to decide, and they have taken a variety of approaches in doing that, I believe.
The second, of course, is the issue of Roe and the cases that follow after it, and those are based on an interpretation of the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, and they are not the result of decisions—of legislative decisions made at the State level or at the Federal level.
Senator COBURN. Can you rationalize any way the logical explanation of how that could be, though? I mean, if you had somebody that wasn’t from this world and they came in and they said, oh, yeah, if you kill it, it was alive, but if you choose to—if you accidentally kill it, it was alive, if you choose to kill, it wasn’t? Can you come to—I mean, I am having trouble getting my mind around that concept that there is any logic there. I just wondered if you were.
Judge ALITO. Well, the answer is that the tort situation has been left for its development under State law, and States have taken a variety of approaches expressing the values that the legislature believes should be embodied in the tort law. And in the abortion context, of course, States have laws regulating abortion, and they’re free to enact whatever statutes they want on this subject as long

as they comply with the Constitution. But we have decisions of the Supreme Court that establish constitutional requirements in the area. I think that’s the explanation. The decisions are made by different bodies.
Senator COBURN. Just one other comment. For the American public to know there are 1.3 million abortions in the U.S. each year. This is from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. And it is very interesting for us to know the purpose that people—why people have an abortion, why women choose to terminate their unborn children: 21 percent say they can’t afford a baby; 21 percent say they don’t want the responsibility; 16 percent say the baby could change their lives; 12 percent have problems with the relationship or want to avoid single parenthood; 11 percent are not mature enough or don’t want to have more children; 3 percent have a possible fetal health problem, of which two-thirds are Down syndrome or spina bifida; 1 percent resulted from rape or incest; 1 percent, the husband or the partner doesn’t want them to have a baby; and 1 percent is they didn’t want anybody else to know somebody had sex with them. And of that, 48 percent of the women who have an abortion in this country have already had one previously. So, in fact, our country, through the auspices of an activist court, in my opinion, has moved to use abortion not as a health issue, but as a convenience issue. And we have done great damage because we have a schizophrenic policy.
My hope, Judge, is that science and technology and recognition of life on some parameter ought to be applied, and my hope is, as they get to the court, that we have common sense. And it doesn’t have to be my way. You know, it could be Senator Schumer’s or Senator Durbin’s view. You know, the fact is there is a legitimate disagreement about rape and incest and medical malformations and all these other things, but we need in this country to have the confidence in the Supreme Court restored, and I think it has taken a hit just like this institution has taken a hit, because it is making decisions that are not based on fact and good law. It is making decisions like we have made decisions, based on expediency. And my hope is, is that you will be confirmed. I think you have great character and great integrity, and integrity I think is the No. 1 issue, not your legal mind, your heart and your soul, and how you view honesty and straightforwardness, and that the result will be that we will see some leadership that will put science and fact, and combine it with the law, and restore the confidence in the Supreme Court.
I asked Judge Roberts, I asked, ‘‘Why do you think we have lost it, some of the confidence of the Court?’’ And he said, ‘‘Because we’ve gotten into areas of policy and not law.’’ And I tend to agree with him, and it is my hope that you would agree with that as well.
I yield back the balance of my time. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. We are trying to figure out what the schedule is going to be for the balance of the evening, and for the balance of the week. We now have Senator Biden, who has requested 20 minutes, and Senator Feinstein 10, and Senator Durbin 10, all of which will be done tomorrow. Anybody who wants a fourth round? I want to do the

third rounds tonight so that we can move ahead promptly tomorrow.
Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I think that if we want to do this we should remember the judge and his family have been sitting here all day. He has been answering questions. He has shown more equanimity than most of us would. You sat here through the whole thing. I sat here through most of it, but Senators can come and go. He cannot. He has had to sit through all of it. His family has had to sit through all of it, and that has to be a strain. I do not think most teenage sons would show that much attention on these things.
I would suggest that we would probably have far better questions if we can go back and go over the transcript. I know what I want to do, I want to go over some of it—I am not going to have an awful lot of questions, but I would like to go back to three or four places from my notes that I have some questions. I want to read the transcript so when I ask the question, in fairness to the judge, it is about what is specifically in the transcript.
This is the same thing we did with Chief Justice Roberts. We came back on that last day, as I recall, and I think we wrapped up around 1, 1:30 in the afternoon.
Chairman SPECTER. No. We wrapped up about 11 o’clock, a little before.
Senator LEAHY. Oh, did we? Chairman SPECTER. A little before 11. Senator LEAHY. When you are having so much fun time goes by so quickly. Chairman SPECTER. We do not have word from Senator Kohl or Senator Feingold. Suppose we put the maximum of 25 minutes on the next round for tomorrow, and suppose we start at 9 o’clock? That means the only people that have to be here are Senator Leahy and myself at 9. Senator LEAHY. I will be here at 9. I am here usually a lot earlier than that. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Schumer just on the auctioneer said yes? Senator LEAHY. That is OK. I will go along with it. And understand though, and I would assume—you have always been fair— if we run into some extraordinary problem, somebody may need a few more minutes. Chairman SPECTER. Anybody who satisfies your extraordinary problem test will get more time. Make it your test. Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, so ordered. Judge Alito, you have shown remarkable stamina, and you have shown, in my opinion, remarkable patience. I think it is unwise for any Senator, including the Chairman, to do too much commenting about anybody else’s questioning, but you have been patient. And people may not like your answers, but they are your answers. We have precedent for that. Nobody has even said they are misleading. They have said they just do not like them. But you have been consistent, and very patient in stating your position, even though you have been called upon to state it repetitively, and repetitively, and repetitively. So I think it is well within the ambit of fairness to say

575 that you have been patient, and you have shown real stamina, as has Mrs. Alito, and as has your loyal family.
So that we will proceed at 9 o’clock tomorrow, and we will have 20 minutes for Senator Biden, 10 minutes for Senator Feinstein, 10 minutes for Senator Durbin, and my expectation is we will not have a great deal of time for Senator Kohl.

NOMINATION OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
THURSDAY, JANUARY 12, 2006
U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, D.C. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9 a.m., in room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, DeWine, Sessions, Graham, Cornyn, Brownback, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, and Durbin. Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume on the confirmation proceedings for Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court of the United States. Good morning, Judge. Saw your family in the hallway as we were coming down. Everybody appears to be bright and rested and ready. Judge ALITO. Thank you, Senator. Chairman SPECTER. The Committee staff, accompanied by representatives of Senator Kennedy, went through the Rusher files yesterday, finishing up their work, I am advised, at about 2 a.m. this morning, and provided me with a memorandum that the Committee staff reviewed more than four boxes of documents from the personal files of William Rusher concerning CAP. Judge Alito’s name never appeared in any document. His name was not mentioned in any of the letters to or from the founder, William Rusher. His name was not mentioned in any of the letters to or from CAP’s long-term executive director, T. Harding Jones. His name does not appear anywhere in the dozens of letters to CAP or from CAP. The files contained canceled checks for subscriptions to CAP’s magazine, Prospect, but none from Judge Alito. The files contained dozens of articles including investigative expos written at the height of the organization’s prominence, but Samuel Alito’s name is nowhere to be found in any of them. The Rusher files contained lists of the board of directors, the advisory board, and the contributors to both CAP and Prospect Magazine, but none of these lists contains Samuel Alito’s name. The files contain minutes and attendance records from CAP meetings in 1983 and 1984, just before Samuel Alito listed the organization on his job application, but Samuel Alito did not attend any of those

meetings, at least according to those records. He was not even mentioned in the minutes. The files contained dozens of issues of CAP’s magazines, but none of the articles was written by, quoted or mentioned Samuel Alito. CAP founder, William Rusher, said, ‘‘I have no recollection of Samuel Alito at all. He certainly was not very heavily involved in CAP if at all.’’
Before turning to Senator Leahy for his allotted time, I would yield to him if he has any opening comments he chooses to make.
Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, as we know, this will be the last opportunity for the American people to learn what Judge Samuel Alito thinks about the fundamental constitutional rights, whether he is going to serve to protect their liberty, their privacy from Government intrusion. I think it is even more critical today because of the efforts to expand Presidential—
Chairman SPECTER. Excuse me, Senator. Do you want to start on your 25—
Senator LEAHY. Oh. I thought you were asking me— Chairman SPECTER. Opening comments, sure, yes. We are not going to start your time clock until you tell us. Senator LEAHY. Just a short opening comment. Chairman SPECTER. Fine. Senator LEAHY. I know the judge probably feels like he has been here and doing nothing but being on a hot seat, but we are talking about a lifetime appointment, and it is the most powerful court in the land. It is at a time when we see this effort to expand Presidential powers such as illegal wiretaps on Americans, the President using a signing statement to create exemptions from laws prohibiting torture. These are all important things. The Supreme Court is our ultimate guardian, has to be our ultimate guardian, and we need to know whether Samuel Alito is willing to be that kind of guardian. I am still troubled by some of the questions. Mr. Chairman, I know you are going to be asking questions, and I will wait to ask mine after that, of course. Chairman SPECTER. I am going to reserve my time at this juncture, and turn to Senator Leahy for time up to 25 minutes. Senator LEAHY. Thank you. In his confirmation hearing last September, we went through hours and hours, days and days for Judge Roberts, now Chief Justice. I asked him if the Constitution permits the execution of an innocent person. He said if they have been falsely convicted and they are innocent, they should not be in prison, let alone executed. I think we all agree with that. But I pushed further because my question was whether the Constitution permits the execution of an innocent person, if you know that they are innocent. He said, ‘‘I would think not.’’ Judge, do you agree with Chief Justice Roberts? Judge ALITO. I agree that it is one of the most fundamental rights protected by our Constitution, that no one may be convicted of an offense unless they are proven to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and further than that, the Supreme Court’s decisions since 1976 dealing with the Eighth Amendment, have attempted to create a whole set of procedural safeguards to make sure that the death penalty is not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously, and this

whole framework is designed to prevent exactly that, to prevent the conviction of an innocent person, and to prevent the imposition of capital punishment on someone who is innocent, or on someone who is guilty of the offense but it not deserving to have that penalty imposed on the person.
Senator LEAHY. Judge, as we know, we saw the cases in Illinois of people a few days away from execution, they have been sentenced to death; they have been convicted; they had their trial, gone to trial; jury came back; apparently appropriate procedure followed on sentencing; they are now sentenced to death. A few days before somebody comes forward at the very last minute because of DNA evidence and says, ‘‘Whoops, we’ve got the wrong person.’’ And then they are let loose. We are finding it in Virginia, and now in other cases it appears that there is a possibility a number of innocent people were executed.
What if you had a case, they have gone through the whole thing, they have been convicted; the judge has followed all of the appropriate sentencing; the jury came back—did everything following the law. And now they are up for execution. Evidence comes up, say DNA evidence, or a confession of somebody else. Would it be unconstitutional then to execute that person?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, it is unconstitutional to execute someone who has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Now, depending—
Senator LEAHY. They may have been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. What I am saying is that a lot of these people were on death row and then had to be commuted at the last moment, when a few days before the execution they found, whoops, we have the wrong guy.
Judge ALITO. Well, that’s the ultimate tragedy that could possibly occur in our criminal justice system, and we should do everything we can to prevent that from ever occurring, and I have not had a case during my time on the court of appeals—I’ve had only a handful of capital punishment cases where there was a suggestion that that was a possibility.
If the evidence develops at the last minute, then I think—and if this is a—it would depend to some degree on—the procedures would depend on—would be different depending on whether the person had been convicted in State court or in Federal court. The first procedural step in either instance would be to file a petition with the trial court. It would be—if it were in State court, it would be a State collateral relief petition, and those are handled differently depending on the State. And then a file of—I’m sorry. You could go to the State court or you could file a second habeas petition, attempt to file a second habeas petition in Federal court, and follow the procedures that are set out in habeas corpus statute.
Senator LEAHY. I understand all of the steps. Like you, I was a prosecutor, even though we do not have the death sentence in Vermont, we do have real life imprisonment, and I remember those. But you agree though with Chief Justice Roberts that the Constitution does not countenance the execution of an innocent person?
Judge ALITO. The Constitution is designed to prevent that.

Senator LEAHY. The reason I ask this, this is something that was originally raised, as I recall, in the Judiciary Committee by Chairman Specter, the Rule of Four. Are you familiar with that procedure on the Supreme Court? In other words, it takes five Justices to stay an execution, but four to hear one of these cases, so usually if there has been four that have agreed it should be stayed, somebody will make the fifth just as a matter of courtesy. That has not been followed that much recently. Chairman Specter has called it a bizarre and unacceptable outcome to not provide the fifth vote. He once introduced legislation to codify the Rule of Four.
If you were one of the Justices and you are there—and these things always seem to happen, everybody is scattered all over the place—four of your fellow justices have said that they would hold. What would you do? They voted to stay the execution. They are asking you to be the fifth vote.
Judge ALITO. I had not heard of this rule until the hearings for Chief Justice Roberts, but it seems to me to be a very sensible procedure because I think we all want to avoid the tragedy of having an innocent person executed or having anyone executed whose constitutional rights have been violated.
Senator LEAHY. I raise it, as I did with then-Judge Roberts here, because some things you will remember from this hearing, some things you will probably try to forget from this hearing, both you and your family, but I hope this one, at least this idea stays in your mind.
About a decade ago in Washington v. Glucksberg, the Supreme Court declined to find that terminally ill patients had a generalized constitutional right to a physician’s aid in dying, preferring the matter be left to the States. The Court noted: ‘‘Throughout the Nation, Americans are engaged in an earnest and profound debate about the morality, legality and practicality of physician-assisted suicide.’’ Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, ‘‘The Court’s holding permits the debate to continue as it should in a democratic society.’’ I remember reading that. I found it very practical, aside from the legal things, a very practical response.
Last spring, we witnessed a fierce legal battle over the medical treatment of Terri Schiavo. She was in a persistent vegetative state for more than a decade, and ultimately after she died, the autopsy showed that. But we found politicians rushing to the cameras, engaged in extraordinary measures to override what the State courts determined be her own wishes, State courts who had heard countless cases on this. Suddenly this became the thing politicians all over the place rushing for it. The power of the Federal Government was wielded by some to determine, in my view, deeply personal choices. The President even came back to Washington in the middle of one of his vacations to sign special legislation on this. Do you agree with the idea advanced in the Cruzan case that the wishes of an unconscious patient, to the degree they can be known, should govern decisions regarding life-sustaining therapies?
Let us assume that the wishes are clearly known. Should they be followed?
Judge ALITO. Well, the Cruzan case proceeded assumed for the sake of argument, which is something that judges often do, that there is a constitutional right to say—that each of us has a con-
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00592 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

581
stitutional right to say, ‘‘I don’t want medical treatment.’’ And the Cruzan decision recognized that this was a right that everybody had at common law. At common law, if someone is subjected to a medical procedure that the person doesn’t want, that’s a battery and it’s a tort, and the person can sue for it. It is illegal. The Court did not—
Senator LEAHY. One of those cases where we got something from that foreign law, in this case English common law; is that correct?
Judge ALITO. Well, that’s correct, and I think that our whole legal system is an outgrowth of English common law.
Senator LEAHY. That popped in to my mind because I was thinking of some of the people talking about paying attention to foreign law. Most of our law is based on foreign law. But go ahead, common law.
Judge ALITO. Most of our common law is an outgrowth of English common law, and I think it helps to understand that background often in analyzing issues that come up.
Senator LEAHY. But you agree with Cruzan? I am thinking if somebody has a ‘‘do not resuscitate’’ order, do you agree with that?
Judge ALITO. That’s a fundamental principle of common law, and Cruzan assumed for the sake of argument that that would be a fundamental constitutional right, but that is a right that people have had under our legal system for a long time, to make that decision for themselves.
Senator LEAHY. My wife is a nurse and she was working on the medical-surgical floor, and she would mention about people with these DNR, do not resuscitate. Would you agree that a patient would have a right—for example, if you have a living will, you have a right to designate somebody who can speak for you in a case of terrible injury or unconsciousness, speak for you on a do not resuscitate, or do not use heroic measures and all the rest, do you agree with that?
Judge ALITO. Yes, Senator. That’s, I think, an extension of the traditional right that I was talking about that existed under common law, and it’s been developed by State legislatures, and in some instances by State courts, to deal with the living will situation and with advances in—which I think is in large measure a response to advances in medical technology which create new issues in this area.
Senator LEAHY. We have three separate and co-equal branches of Government, as the Constitution says. We have these checks and balances, and most of us feel that the Congress is going to carry out that check and balance. They have to carry out real oversight and make sure the Government is accountable to the American people. If you do not do that, corruption and incompetence sets in. We have given a lot of powers to our Government in the fight against terrorism and others, and the check and balances to make sure there is oversight. Do you believe in the general principle of the Congress having major oversight powers?
Judge ALITO. I don’t think there’s any question about that. Senator LEAHY. Let me go to this, and I was thinking of this as we were talking about the Schiavo case. I do not want you to have to get involved in what many found was kind of a sorry exercise when people are already suffering enough, a sorry exercise by the

Congress, so I will not talk about the House committees’ unbelievable subpoena to Terri Schiavo. But let me ask you this: could the Judiciary Committee issue a subpoena for a defendant on death row in a State prison, if we believed he was about to be executed and thought he was innocent?
Judge ALITO. Could the subpoena—could this Committee issue a subpoena—
Senator LEAHY. And enforce it? Judge ALITO. To have the defendant come and testify before the Committee? Senator LEAHY. Yes. Say it is an hour before execution, for example, to make it even a tougher case. Judge ALITO. It’s not a question that I ever thought of. Sitting here I can’t think of an objection to it, but I would have to—I would have to hear whatever arguments there were to be made. Senator LEAHY. This may seem to be bouncing around here a little bit. I am trying to go over again in my own mind, after looking at the transcript last night, some of the things we were saying. You were in a discussion with a number of Senators about views of the court, or how the American people view courts, and how basically in a democracy courts have to have the respect of people if they are going to be able to carry out their orders. Brown is probably one of the key examples there where the Chief Justice worked 21⁄2 years until he got a unanimous Court decision. Justice O’Connor gave a speech decrying the present climate of antipathy between the judiciary and some Members of Congress, and I have spoken with her and others—and the late Chief Justice—about this. She expressed concern about efforts to limit Federal court jurisdiction in areas that some Members of Congress think the Federal courts should not be involved. We have seen a number of efforts to strip the Federal courts of jurisdiction when some Members of Congress felt they disagreed with them. Now, I thought some of these issues were settled by Marbury when Chief Justice Marshall said, ‘‘It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.’’ Now, the court-stripping bills are not without precedent. Recent efforts have failed. I recall one where three Senators finally talked it down until it ran out of time. I was one of the three. Senator Lowell Weicker of Connecticut was one of the other three. On the way out, the third one put his arm around us and said, ‘‘I think we are the only true conservatives in this Senate.’’ We both said, ‘‘Thank you, Barry Goldwater. We appreciate you joining us in this.’’ I took it as a great compliment. Now, imagine that in the early 1950s Congress enacted a law that purported to strip all Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction to hear cases and appeals involving the segregation of public schools. Would such a law have been constitutional? Judge ALITO. Well, there’s a debate among scholars about the extent of the authority of Congress to structure the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and there are those who say that Congress has the authority to eliminate appellate jurisdiction by topic, and there are those who say that if—and they rely on the language of Article III. And there are those who say that to take away juris-

583
diction over a category of cases such as that would be a violation of another constitutional provision, in that instance a violation perhaps of the Equal Protection Clause.
And there is this debate that it has not—that it is not something—
Senator LEAHY. Have you taken part in that debate? Judge ALITO. Pardon me? Senator LEAHY. Have you taken a position in that debate? Judge ALITO. I have not taken part in that, and I have read— Senator LEAHY. Would you like to? Judge ALITO. Not at this time. [Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. I don’t know why that surprises me. Judge ALITO. The case law is not definitive on this question. According to the scholars, Ex Parte McCardle is a case that can be interpreted in a number of different ways. Senator LEAHY. You know, we had many in the Congress at that time, had they thought that Brown v. Board of Education was about to come down the way it did, probably would have made efforts to strip the authority of the Supreme Court to hear it. And I am afraid that as we find some of these efforts where the courts become a very convenient whipping boy to people looking for votes or whatever, that that might happen again. And I would suggest you think long and hard on it. Let me ask you this, and it probably invites more effort to find out. On more than one occasion, the House of Representatives has included a provision in an appropriations bill—and we all agree that the Congress has the power of the purse—but in an appropriations bill saying that none of the funds can be spent enforcing a particular court decision, pick something that they feel is unpopular at the moment, so they say no money can be spent to enforce it. Let us say the Court has ruled basically on a constitutional issue saying this shall be enforced; the Congress says, no, we won’t allow money to be spent. Does that violate the Constitution? Judge ALITO. Well, that’s also a provocative constitutional question. I can’t recall an instance where that has been done with respect to a constitutional decision. Perhaps it has been. I do recall back during the 1980s that it was done with respect to an issue of antitrust. And I would assume that if there wasn’t—well, obviously if there isn’t a constitutional question raised by that limitation on the expenditure of funds, and if you’re talking about a non-constitutional question, maybe there is no constitutional issue raised, there wouldn’t be an obstacle to Congress’s doing that. With respect to a constitutional question, that’s a provocative constitutional issue that—I don’t know the answer to it, and I cannot think of precedent on that point. I don’t believe there is any. Senator LEAHY. Let’s take a nonconstitutional—I want to make sure I understand your answer. Decisions come down of whatever nature. You mentioned antitrust. Whatever it is comes down from the Court, and it is going to require some enforcement. And the Congress says, no, we are not going to put the money in there. Can the Congress do that?

584
Judge ALITO. Well, I’d have to know the facts of the case and hear the arguments on both sides of it. Unless there was a constitutional objection, then that falls within one of the most important powers of the Congress, the expenditure of funds Congress exercises. The Framers wanted Congress to have the control of the purse because Congress is the branch that is closest to the people. And I would think that—and Congress obviously has great latitude in this area.
I don’t know what constitutional objections would be raised to doing that with respect to a nonconstitutional question, but I’d have to understand exactly what was—
Senator LEAHY. Well, it is something to keep in mind because it may happen. You know, if we can grandstand, if Congress can grandstand the way it did on the Schiavo case, you have to wonder what else may come down.
One of the advantages or disadvantages of being here for a long time, I have actually been here for the hearings on every member of the Supreme Court, including that of former Chief Justice Rehnquist. And Senator Specter and I have served here together a long time. And I went back to one of his questions. He asked then-Justice Rehnquist whether Congress can strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over First Amendment cases involving freedom of speech, press, or religion. And I think the Chairman remembers this. He can be a rather tenacious questioner, as I know from some of my weekend phone calls from him. But he kept pushing thenJustice Rehnquist until he finally got an answer. In the end, thenJustice Rehnquist gave his view. He said the Congress could not remove the Court’s jurisdiction over First Amendment cases.
So let me ask the same question that Senator Specter asked in 1986. Does Congress have the authority to say the Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction over First Amendment issues of freedom of speech, press, and religion?
Judge ALITO. Well, I would give the same answer to that that I gave to the more general question you asked a few minutes ago about taking away the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction over a topic of cases. It’s not a question that I have obviously had to deal with in my capacity as a judge or something that I have written about or studied in any sort of a focused way. My understanding of the writing on the question is that there’s a division of thought among leading constitutional scholars on the issue, and there are some who argue that Congress has plenary authority to define the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and there are others who argue that if Congress takes away the authority of the Supreme Court to hear a particular type of case, that there could be a violation of another constitutional provisions, and in that instance it would be the First Amendment. And as a matter of constitutional law, I don’t feel I can go further than that. I have—
Senator LEAHY. But, Judge, this is somewhat similar to the initial answers given by then-Justice Rehnquist. But he ultimately came down and said in that hearing that Congress could not remove the Court’s jurisdiction over First Amendment cases.

585
Are you telling me that—and I just wanted to make sure I fully understand your answer—you are not willing to go to the extent then-Justice Rehnquist did at his hearing?
Judge ALITO. I gave a speech a while ago addressing this question from a practical standpoint or touching on it from a practical standpoint, and I said that I thought that doing something like this would be an awkward and undesirable way of proceeding because it would lead to a lack of uniformity in decisions. If jurisdiction is taken away from the Supreme Court but jurisdiction remains in the courts of appeals, then conflicts in the circuit would develop— conflicts in the circuits would develop and you’d have conflicting decisions potentially in different parts—governing in different parts of the country and no way to resolve the issue. And if the jurisdiction was taken away from the Federal courts in general, then you would potentially have conflicting State court decisions. So the First Amendment, or whatever constitutional provision was at issue, would mean something different potentially in Vermont than it did in New Hampshire or in some other State.
So there are undesirable practical consequences of proceeding in that way. I’m—
Senator LEAHY. Your answer would be the same, I assume, if I was asking the question about the Fourth or the Fifth or the Sixth Amendment, basically the same?
Judge ALITO. It would be, Senator. I have just not studied this issue in enough depth to be able to give an answer. I would have to study it in depth and probably hear it in the context of a case. What I do know is that there is a division of authority among leading constitutional scholars, and I would not want to hazard an answer to the question here without going into the question with a lot—studying the question in considerably greater depth than I have.
Senator LEAHY. This will be my last, and I appreciate the courtesy of the Chairman, who, I might say, has run this hearing with total fairness, as he always does. I may have some followup questions in writing, but this will be last chance to ask you anything.
Under your theory of the unitary Executive, are citizen suit provisions, such as those in our environmental laws, allowing citizens to act basically as private attorneys general and sue polluters, are they constitutional?
Judge ALITO. I don’t see a connection between the unitary Executive theory and that issue, and I think Congress has the authority to create a private cause of action for anyone that Congress chooses to create such a cause of action for, subject only to whatever limitations are imposed by the Constitution. But we often grapple with the issue of whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action for a particular class of plaintiffs. That’s a difficult issue that comes up with some frequency in Federal litigation. But where Congress speaks directly to the question and says that people with—and defined the category of cases, the category of plaintiffs who can bring a suit, a citizen suit, or whatever it is, then that’s definitive, of course, subject only to whatever limitations the Constitution imposes.
Senator LEAHY. Judge, that is an answer—the substance of what you said is something obviously I would like, but I am still troubled

by it because in November 2000, right after the Presidential election, you came and spoke to a meeting of the Annual Federalist Society Lawyers Convention about the powers of the President. And when you discussed your theory of the unitary Executive, you criticized the Supreme Court’s upholding the independent counsel statute, among other things. Is your answer today different than what you were saying then?
Judge ALITO. What I said in that speech was that the Congress— I’m sorry, the Constitution confers the Executive power on the President, and when we are dealing with something that is within the President’s Executive power, without getting into the scope of Executive power, and there I was focusing on the President’s duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. That’s explicitly set out in the Constitution, so there can’t be any debate about whether or not the President has that power.
When we’re dealing with something that is within the scope of the President’s Executive power, the President should have the authority to control the executive branch, and the latest expression of the Supreme Court on that issue at the time was the Morrison decision, and the Morrison decision formulated the governing standard in what I would call functional terms. And it said that Congress has the ability to—has the authority to place restrictions on the President’s ability to remove inferior executive officers, provided that in doing so Congress does not take away the President’s authority to control the executive branch. And I was talking about the importance of maintaining the principle that the President is the head of the executive branch and should control the executive branch.
Senator LEAHY. But you did at that time criticize the Supreme Court’s upholding the independent counsel statute, did you not?
Judge ALITO. I said that it was inconsistent with what you could call the pure theory of the unitary Executive. But at the time, of course, Morrison had been decided, and it was a resounding 8–1 decision, and it is a very important precedent of the Court.
Senator LEAHY. If you had been there, it might have been 7–2? Is that what you are suggesting?
Judge ALITO. Well, if it comes up before me, if I am confirmed, then Morrison is a strong expression of the view of the Supreme Court on the question, and an 8–1 precedent on an issue that was important and controversial at the time when it came up before the Court, and it was very clear and, as I said, a resounding decision by the Supreme Court on the question.
Senator LEAHY. Well, I do not want to intrude on other Senators’ time, and I may do a followup question with you. Thank you for your answers. We have obviously agreed on some things and disagreed on others. I appreciate you taking the time to answer.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your time. Chairman SPECTER. I am going to use just a little of my reserved time to comment on what Senator Leahy raised about the issue with Chief Justice Rehnquist on his statement that you could not take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States on First Amendment issues. That was as interesting a dialog as I have had in my tenure here, and I have had a few, and it arose in a curious context.

I had asked the Chief Justice about the question and he refused to answer. And overnight, the staff had found an article written by a young Arizona lawyer named William H. Rehnquist in 1958, which was published in the Harvard Law Record, not the Harvard Law Review but the Harvard Law Record. And in that article, lawyer Rehnquist said that the Senate Judiciary Committee was derelict in its duty in questioning Justice Whittaker at his confirmation hearing in not asking pointed questions about due process or equal protection.
When my turn came, I came back to then-Justice Rehnquist and said, how about it? Are you that William H. Rehnquist. He admitted he was, didn’t have much choice. And I said, well, how about this article? And he emphatically said, ‘‘I was wrong.’’
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. But that provided— Senator HATCH. He was under oath. Chairman SPECTER. That provided an opening, and I proceeded to continue the line of questioning. Finally, he allowed as to how Congress couldn’t take away the Court’s power over the First Amendment. It seems to me patently clear that Congress cannot take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on constitutional issues. It cannot do it. That is the principal function of the Supreme Court of the United States, is to interpret the Constitution. And if the Congress could take away that authority, the Court’s authority would be vacuous. But then, as you might expect, I asked him about the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure, and Fifth Amendment, privilege against self-incrimination, went right down the line. He refused to answer every question. And I said, well, why will you answer questions on the First Amendment and not on the rest of them? He wouldn’t answer that, either. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Chief Justice Rehnquist was confirmed 65 to 33, which confirmed an observation which I have made from time to time, Judge Alito, that nominees answer just about as many questions as they think they have to to be confirmed. He may turn out to be a notable exception, but I think that is a valid generalization. It also confirmed my experience that nominees remember these proceedings and nominees are influenced by these proceedings in very subtle ways. We don’t extract promises, but when Senator Leahy very adroitly asks you about the rule of four on granting cert, four Justices say the cert is granted but it takes five to stay an execution in a capital case, how ridiculous can you be? Senator Leahy wondered if you would remember that. Well, I predict you will, if confirmed, remember that. In fact, I predict you will remember it even if you are not confirmed. But to this day, Justices’ comments to me about questions they had here—every time I see Justice Souter, he says he still hasn’t made up his mind on whether Korea was a war or not. And the other Justices—I won’t go into any more detail. I am going to reserve the balance of my 20 minutes and 54 seconds. Senator Hatch?

Senator HATCH. I will reserve my 25 minutes. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kennedy, you are recognized for 25 minutes. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Good morning. Judge ALITO. Good morning, Senator. Senator KENNEDY. Just to initially follow-up on the last area of questioning by Senator Leahy about a unitary Executive, I have asked you questions about this earlier in the week. My colleagues have. I am not going to get back into the speech that you gave at the Federalist Society. Well, I will mention just the one part of it that is of concern. ‘‘If the administrative agencies are in the Federal Government, which they certainly are, they have to be in one of those branches, legislative, executive, judicial, and the logical candidate is the executive branch. The President has the power and the duty to supervise the way in which the—-to which subordinate executive branch officials exercise the President’s power, carrying Federal law into execution.’’ So we asked you about that power and that authority and you responded, as I think you just repeated here, that the Humphrey’s case was the dominant case on this issue. Am I roughly correct? I am trying to get through some material. Is it— Judge ALITO. Yes. It was the leading case that was followed up by the Morrison case. Senator KENNEDY. Followed up by the Morrison case as the controlling case on these administrative agencies. But what you haven’t mentioned to date is your dissent from the Morrison case. We have been trying to gain your view about the unitary Executive. Most people believe we have an executive, legislative, and judicial branch—and now we have this unitary Executive which many people don’t really understand and it sounds a little bizarre. You have indicated support for it. You have commented back and forth about it. You have indicated the controlling cases that establish the administrative agencies. You refer to the Morrison case as guiding the authority. But then in your comments about Morrison, you then proceed to outline a legal strategy for getting around Morrison. This is what you said. ‘‘Perhaps the Morrison decision can be read in a way that heeds if not the constitutional text that I mention, at least the objective for setting up a unitary Executive. That could lead to a fairly strong degree of Presidential control over the workings of the administrative agencies in the area of policymaking.’’ Our question in this hearing is what is your view of the unitary Executive. You have responded to a number of our people, but we are interested in your view and your comments on the Morrison case, which you say is controlling, but we want to know your view and it includes these words—‘‘that could lead to a fairly strong degree of Presidential control over the workings of the administrative agencies in the area of policymaking.’’ Now, that would alter and change the balance between the Congress and the President in a very dramatic and significant way, would it not? Judge ALITO. I don’t think that it would, Senator. The administrative agencies—the term ‘‘administrative agencies’’ is a broad term and it includes the Federal Reserve—it includes agencies that

589
are not regarded as so-called independent agencies. It includes agencies that are within—that are squarely within the executive branch under anybody’s understanding of the term, agencies where they are headed by a Presidential appointee whose term of office is at the pleasure of the President, and that’s principally what I’m talking about there, the ability of the President to control the structure of the executive branch, not agencies—the term ‘‘administrative agencies’’ is not synonymous with agencies like the FTC, which was involved in the Humphrey’s Executor case, where the agency is headed by a commission and the commissioners are appointed by the President for a term of office and there are conditions placed on the removal of the commissioners.
Senator KENNEDY. The point, Judge, the answer you gave both to my colleagues Senator Leahy, Durbin, and to me, and the quote, ‘‘the concept of a unitary Executive does not have to do with the scope of Executive power’’ really was not accurate. You are admitting now that it has to do with the administrative agencies and this would have a dramatic and important reconsideration of the balance between the Executive and the Congress. I haven’t got the time to go through, but we are talking about the Federal Reserve, Consumer Product Safety, the Federal Trade Commission, a number of the agencies that would be directly considered and that have very, very important independent strategy.
Judge ALITO. Senator, as to the agencies that are headed by commissions, the members of which are appointed for terms, and there are limitations placed on removal, the precedents—the leading precedent is Humphrey’s Executor and that is reinforced, and I would say very dramatically reinforced, by the decision in Morrison, which did not involve such an agency. It involved an officer who was carrying out what I think everyone would agree is a core function of the executive branch, which is the enforcement of the law, taking care that the laws are faithfully executed, and yet—
Senator KENNEDY. But the point here is that you take exception to Morrison. You are very clear. We are interested in your views. We understand Humphrey’s and Morrison are the guiding laws, but we talked about stare decisis and other precedents. But you have a different view with regards to the role of the Executive now, an enhanced role, what they call the unitary Executive, and that has to do, as well, with the balance between the Executive and the Congress in a very important way in terms of these administrative agencies.
I haven’t got the time to go all the way through, but we did have some discussion about those agencies and how it would alter the balance of authority and power between the Congress and the Executive. That is very important. It is enormously interesting. We have had Professor Calabresi from Harvard University spell this out in great detail, and I know you have separated yourself a bit from his thinking, to the extent that he would go in terms of administrative agencies. The point is, there would be a different relationship if your view was the dominant view in the Supreme Court between the Executive and the Congress and that is really the point.
Judge ALITO. But Senator Kennedy, what I have tried to say is that I regard this as a line of precedent that is very well developed

and I have no quarrel with it and it culminates in Morrison, in which the Supreme Court said that even as to an inferior officer who is carrying out the core Executive function of taking care that the laws are faithfully executed, it is permissible for Congress to place restrictions on the ability of the President to remove such an officer, provided that in doing so, there is no interference with the President’s authority, and they found no interference with that authority there. That is an expression of the Supreme Court’s view on an issue where the claim for—where the claim that there should be no removal restrictions imposed is far stronger than it is with respect to an independent agency like the one involved in Humphrey’s Executor.
Senator KENNEDY. The point is that you differed with Morrison and outlined a different kind of a strategy. I want to move on.
I want to come back just briefly again to the Vanguard issue, where I continue to be troubled and puzzled by your answers to me and others. Now, just to get back to the starting point, in your sworn statement to the Committee when you were nominated to the circuit court in 1990, on page 15 of that statement, you wrote this about your recusal practices. ‘‘I do not believe that conflicts of interest relating to my financial interests are likely to arise. I would, however, disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard Companies.’’ So according to your sworn promise, you were going to recuse yourself from cases involving the Vanguard Companies, is that correct?
Judge ALITO. I said I would disqualify myself from any cases involving the Vanguard Companies.
Senator KENNEDY. All right. You also said you would recuse yourself from any case involving your sister’s firm—
Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator KENNEDY.—and cases in which you were involved in the U.S. Attorney’s Office, is that correct? Judge ALITO. Yes, that’s correct. Senator KENNEDY. And there has been some discussion as to whether that commitment covered only the initial period of your judgeship, and I am not going to go into that. I am not going into that. I just want to know about the steps you took to meet your commitment to the Committee even in the initial years. On Tuesday, you told Senator Feingold that you had no recollection of whether you put Vanguard on your recusal list when you were first appointed to the bench in 1990. Is that still right? Judge ALITO. That’s correct. I don’t have the initial list that was submitted to the clerk’s office and I think I clarified in response to Senator Feingold’s question that that is a list for—that is a list that is used by the clerk’s office to make the first cut on recusal issues, but it is not by any means the last word. Senator KENNEDY. OK. And in 1990, you owned $80,000 of Vanguard funds, is that right? And over the years, it grew to hundreds of thousands, is that correct? Judge ALITO. It grew, yes. Senator KENNEDY. So you were getting reports from Vanguard now either monthly or quarterly or annually, were you not, reporting—

591
Judge ALITO. Yes, I was. Senator KENNEDY. All during this period of time? Judge ALITO. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. Do you know whether Vanguard was on your recusal list in 1991? Judge ALITO. I don’t know what was on my—the list that was with the clerk’s office prior to the time when the system was computerized. I have seen recently, and I believe you have copies of the lists that were on the computer, and those lists do not include Vanguard. There is no question about that. Senator KENNEDY. We received your standing recusal list from the Third Circuit earlier this week. It is dated January 28, 1993, and Vanguard is not on it. You have your sister’s law firm on it. You have your cases from the U.S. Attorney’s Office on it, but not Vanguard, your largest investment. Here are the recusal lists for 1994, 1995, 1996, and Vanguard is not on any of them, either. Do you have any reason to disagree with the report from the Clerk of the Court? Judge ALITO. I don’t, Senator. I don’t know whether—I have no comment on the list. That’s the list that they had and I don’t know exactly how that list came about, but that’s the list they have. Senator KENNEDY. What does it say at the top of the 1/28/93 list under the date? As I understand, it says ‘‘no changes.’’ Judge ALITO. As of 1/28/93, no changes. That’s correct. Senator KENNEDY. So this was 1993, so there were no changes in that from 1992, and you have listed probably eight or nine different items on there, have you not? Judge ALITO. There are eight items listed. Senator KENNEDY. OK. So you have got eight items on there. Vanguard isn’t on it, and it says no changes from the previous year. So I assume that means the 1992 list was the same, so that you did not have Vanguard on the 1992 list, either. Do you remember whether you ever placed Vanguard on your recusal list at any time between the time you were sworn in and January 1993? Judge ALITO. As I said, I don’t have a copy of lists that predate this. In fact, I didn’t have a copy of these lists and I don’t know, obviously, I can’t recall what was on the earlier lists. Senator KENNEDY. Well, in 1994, you removed the U.S. Attorney’s Office from your recusal list, is that right? Judge ALITO. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. So you did revisit the recusal list at that time. Judge ALITO. I notified the clerk’s office to take the U.S. Attorney’s Office off the list. I actually think I have a copy of the letter that I sent there. I don’t believe that I looked at the list and crossed it off the list. I sent them a letter and I outlined—I say, it has now been 4 years. This was an instance—another instance of my going beyond what I had to do. I recused myself from everything from the office, not just things that were there while I was in office. But after the passage of 4 years, I thought that the cases that I had had any possible connection with had washed out and so I sent a letter, and I have a copy of the letter, saying, take it off this list but notify the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the public defender’s offices that they should notify the clerk’s office if any case

comes up in which they have any reason to believe that any aspect of the case was in the U.S. Attorney’s Office while I was there.
Senator KENNEDY. Well, I just mention, one of the things you had to do was put Vanguard on the list, was it not, because you gave the assurances to the Committee, sworn testimony, that you were going to recuse yourself. That was one of the things—
Judge ALITO. Senator, if it was not on the initial list, then that would be an oversight on my part. I said in answering the question to the Senate, I don’t believe conflicts of interest are likely to arise. They really rarely do arise with respect to mutual funds. That’s one of the main reasons why judges and other people who have to worry about conflicts invest in mutual funds, and no Vanguard case came before me—no case involving Vanguard came before me for 12 years.
Senator KENNEDY. The point is, judges—as I understand and is their responsibility—take the whole issue on recusal extremely seriously and review those lists very, very carefully. Given the assurances and the pledge and the promise under oath to the Committee. Now we find out that it is not on your list, and over the period of these last weeks, we have heard so many explanations, Judge. This is what confuses us.
We hear first of all that it is a computer glitch. Then we hear, well, it doesn’t really apply because it is an initial service list, so Vanguard really wasn’t in it because I didn’t make the decisions on it until after I had been in 12 years. I made the pledge to the Committee. I don’t know how good that pledge was, or how many years it was good, but that initial pledge—initial service meant I didn’t have to do it. And then we heard the excuse of, well, it was a pro se case, and we had different computers. That was what was mentioned in my office. It is a pro se case. We have different computers. There are different computers in the clerk’s office than exist in the law firms here in Washington from all over the country. I could never quite understand it because a pro se—obviously talking about individuals—you would think that that might even have a higher kind of a requirement.
But the facts are that you never put that Vanguard on your recusal list, and all of these papers were in your control. And that, I think, is a matter of concern to the—it should be to all of us.
Judge ALITO. Senator, could I just say a brief comment on that? Senator KENNEDY. Yes. Judge ALITO. I have tried to be as forthcoming in explaining what happened here as I possibly could be, and I am one of those judges that you described who take recusals very, very seriously. And I served for 15-and-a-half years. I sat on the merits on well over 4,000 cases. In addition to that, let me just mention the statistics for a recent year, and I think these are typical of my entire period of service. During the last calendar year, I received over 500 petitions for rehearing; most of those are in cases I didn’t sit on initially; over 400 motions. Most of those are in cases I didn’t hear on the merits, and many of those are just as important as appeals on the merits because they involve things like whether someone is going to be removed to a country where the person claims that they will be subjected to persecution, or they are applications by habeas petitioners

for permission to proceed with—to take an appeal in a habeas case. And if we don’t issue the certificate of appealability, that is the end of the matter for that petitioner, who may be serving a very lengthy sentence or a life sentence.
So we are talking about well over a thousand cases a year. Now—and this is over a course of 15 years. This Monga case is one case and I have said there was an oversight on my part in not focusing on my personal practice when the issue came before me. And when the recusal issue was brought to my attention, I did everything that I could to make sure that nobody could come away from this with the impression that Ms. Maharaj got anything other than an absolutely fair appeal.
But I have tried to explain the whole thing. I have not given conflicting answers, but I have been asked a number of different questions and there are a number of steps that were involved in what took place. The fact that it was a pro se case doesn’t—I mentioned that not because pro se cases are any less important than any other category of cases. They are very important, but it is the fact that our court uses a different system for pro se cases. We don’t have these clearance sheets, and that is when I have typically focused on the issue of recusal.
Senator KENNEDY. Well, I thank you, Judge. I think if we had in the beginning—we all make mistakes and I have certainly made more than my share. But if we had a statement on this, I think we could have cleared this all up in the very beginning if it was just said it was a mistake, it wasn’t on the list, it should have been on the list, as we are saying now. We would never have had to get all this or go through this.
But we have had a series of explanations—the light not going off when I looked over the Vanguard case, the computer glitches, the changes of the computers, I wasn’t told by my clerks. We had all of those statements, and so this was what troubled many of us on the Committee about getting straight answers on an issue which is of great importance.
Mr. Chairman, I will use the remainder of my time with a brief comment. I want to thank our Chairman for the fair and dignified way that he has conducted the hearing. I thank our ranking member, Senator Leahy, for his usual courtesies, as well. And I thank Judge Alito for your willingness to serve, and thanks to your family for being here and for the support they have given throughout these hearings.
These stakes are very high, and that was reflected in the variety of questions posed over the past 3 days. We started these hearings seeking answers. We have come with even more questions about Judge Alito’s commitment to fairness and equality for all.
Unitary Executive: We discussed Judge Alito’s expansive views on Presidential authority. He distanced himself from the theory of the so-called unitary Executive, one that promotes extremely expanded Executive power. He gave the Committee platitudes about Supreme Court precedent and the Constitution, but his comments before this Committee run away from his statements of the past, some as recently as 5 years ago, that embrace this very radical, and I believe bizarre theory.

Professor Stephen Calabresi, one of the originators of the unitary Executive theory, says that the impact on this Nation is vast and dramatic. It obliterates the independence of agencies that protect the public, such as the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Elections Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, and much more.
It makes no sense to describe the effects of this bizarre theory in any other terms. That is how its founders brazenly described it. Somehow, Judge Alito expects us to buy his unique and lonely portrayal of this radical theory as something less than it is.
On the Concerned Alumni of Princeton, much has been made of the wide interest in Judge Alito’s interest in this organization and its frankly bigoted views. I was pleased that Judge Alito distanced himself from its repulsive anti-woman, anti-black, anti-disability, anti-gay pronouncements—views that were especially pronounced at the time that Judge Alito believes he joined.
But we still do not have a clear answer to why Judge Alito joined this reprehensible group in the first place. We still do not know why he believed that membership in the group would enhance his job application in the Reagan Justice Department. We still don’t know why he chose this organization among so many others organizations that he likely belonged to, but somehow can’t remember why.
In Vanguard, some of our Republican colleagues find it shocking that we would even question Judge Alito about his failure to recuse himself from Vanguard cases. But the real shock is that Judge Alito failed to meet his sworn promise to this Committee more seriously. He says it was an oversight that he corrected 12 years after he made that promise.
But now we know from his own testimony and records that he apparently never put Vanguard on the recusal list, even immediately after his promise to this Committee. He has failed to give us any plausible explanation. The bottom line is that he just didn’t think his commitment to the Committee and to the U.S. Senate was important enough to honor.
On the 1985 job application, in my office Judge Alito tried to distance himself from the ideological views and legal opinions expressed in the 1985 job application to the Reagan Justice Department. He brushed it off as just a job application. Now, he has tried before the Committee to distance himself from the stunning statement that the White House and Congress somehow are superior to the Supreme Court, the keeper of our liberties.
He didn’t back away one inch from his view that a woman’s right to make her own reproductive decisions is not protected under the Constitution. He didn’t back away from his criticism of the principle of one person/one vote.
On the cases he decided, in case after case we see legal contortions and inconsistent reasoning to bend over backward to help the powerful. He may cite instances to think that he helped the little guy, but the record is clear that the average person has a hard time getting a fair shake in Judge Alito’s courtroom.
We are not expecting judges to produce particular results in their decisions, but we do expect fairness for understanding the realworld impact of their decisions. Frankly, it would be more com-

forting if Judge Alito gave individuals the same benefit of the doubt in his courtroom that he is asking from this Committee on Vanguard, CAP, the unitary Executive, and women’s privacy.
Now, the debate over the nomination continues. In the end, this debate really is about the path of progress and the kind of America we hope to become. America is noblest when it is just to all of its citizens in equal measure. America is freest when the rights and liberties of all are respected. America is strongest when all can share fairly in its prosperity. And we need a Court that will hold us true to these guiding principles today and into the future.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Hatch has stated his wish to reclaim at this point some of his reserved time. Senator Hatch. Senator HATCH. I don’t intend to be very long, but I really believe that bringing up Vanguard or the Princeton matter goes beyond the pale at this point in this hearing, and let me just make this case. Some of your critics, Judge, have focused a lot of attention on the actions over the Vanguard matter, and I think most people who think, think this is really a case of much ado about nothing. Certainly, no law required you to recuse yourself in that case. As a matter, the law, helped put together by one of the leading Democrat ethicists and professors of law, reads as follows: ‘‘financial interest means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a ‘financial interest’ in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund.’’ Now, you did not participate in the management of the fund, right? Judge ALITO. No, I certainly did not. Senator HATCH. OK. That is what the law says. So what is this big case that is being made? It must be that since you signed, among dozens of pages, the Committee form that says in the initial service you agreed to recuse yourself in the Vanguard matter, and then you made a mistake later, 12 years later, which you rectified—in other words, you lived up to your word in every sense of that term, whether or not you considered the initial service or not. But anybody who looks at it would have to say, my gosh, that doesn’t mean 12 years from now. But you even ignored that and said I recognize that I made a mistake. I recused myself even when I didn’t have to recuse myself and did everything I could to live up to my word, which you did. In other words, you lived up to your word. That is a fair interpretation, isn’t it? Judge ALITO. It is, Senator. I said in the—even if you read the answer as setting out a promise that would exist—that would be binding on me for the entire term of my judicial service, I did disqualify myself in the only Vanguard case that ever came before me.

Senator HATCH. And so to imply somehow or other that you were dishonest because you lived up to your word in the end, I think is a little bit beyond the pale.
The ABA reviewed this matter and found that you have an excellent record for integrity. You earned for the second time the highest American Bar Association rating of well qualified.
Now, I put in the record yesterday letters from several ethics professors who have examined this issue and found nothing improper. They agree that you lived up to your word and you didn’t have to, nor will you have to in the future. That is what that law says in 28 U.S. Code Section 455(d)(4)(i). That is what it says.
Now, I might add that included a letter from Professor Geoffrey Hazard. Back when Justice Breyer was up for confirmation and questions were raised about the propriety of him hearing a case in which some argued falsely, I think, that he had a financial interest, my friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, favorably cited a letter from Professor Hazard that was favorable to Justice Breyer. And by the way, I am not going to judge the two cases, but it was every bit as much a case as this weak thing that has been brought against you.
Now, you know, what is going on here is nothing but an attempt to make a big deal about nothing, a small thing, and I think it is being done with a bit of old bait-and-switch, if you ask my opinion. I might add that when Judge Breyer—what happened there in the case of Breyer is I reviewed, I investigated it, and when the facts showed that he did no wrong, as they show you have done no wrong, I came out of the blocks and defended him. And I am glad I did because he, like you, is an honest man. Neither Justice Breyer nor you have gone into public service to make money. That is pretty apparent.
Now, to have this like you have done something wrong because you made a mistake and then you rectified it—my gosh, how many times do we have to beat that old, dead horse?
With regard to other thing, I have my own opinion as to why that is repeatedly brought up, when you have adequately explained that you didn’t remember much about it, or anything at all. Now, we find that the Rusher memoranda contained no reference to you. He never heard of you before now. And it makes you wonder, why are they bringing that up? Well, I have got my opinions on that and I think my opinions are right.
The fact of the matter is you have been straightforward here. You have honestly answered the questions. You have answered more questions than almost any Supreme Court nominee in my 29 years in the Senate and I don’t think you have been fairly treated. And it makes everybody wonder, why would anybody want to do these jobs?
I know law review graduates who make more than the Chief Justice this year, new graduates from law school. So it is apparent you are going into this because you love your country, you want to serve it. And you have done it well for 15 years, and anybody who knows you knows that. And I know you. So I think it is just wrong to keep bringing these phony issues up. And you have to ask, well, why are they doing it because they are so phony?
That is all I care to say. I will reserve the balance of my time.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Your 18 minutes and 9 seconds will be reserved.
Senator HATCH. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Biden has asked for 20 minutes. We are going to be a little more flexible with this final round because I see light at the end of the tunnel, quite frankly. I see our conclusion of these hearings probably not tonight, but tomorrow, not too late. We have started all the sessions exactly on time and we have held to the time limits up until now, which I think we have to do if we want to do if we want ahead. If you once start to slip on when you start or the timing, it just gets out of hand, but at this juncture on a final round we have a little more flexibility. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. Senator Biden, you are recognized for up to 20 minutes, as you have requested, and if you go a little more, my gavel will stay put. Senator BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will try not to. Judge, I heard the Chairman. I happened to be doing something on Darfur and I was in the conference room and I heard the Chairman say that—which I agree, he and I have talked about this— nominees tend to answer as many questions as they think they have to in order to get confirmed. I would say that that has been the case with all nominees basically since Judge Bork. I would also add another, I think, truism that has developed is they tend to answer controversial questions in direct proportion to how much they think the public is likely to agree with them. It all goes to kind of a central point here, is what is the public entitled to know about what you think, or what anyone thinks, before they go on the Court. I realize there is this dynamic tension between your independence as a nominee, would you be an independent Justice, and answering questions. But having said that, let me go to an area that I hope you will engage me in and it goes to Executive power. I have had the dubious distinction because of my role in the Judiciary Committee and on the Foreign Relations Committee in the last three or four times forces have been used by a President to be the guy in charge of, at least on my side of the aisle, drafting or negotiating the drafting of the authority to use force, whether it was President Clinton, before that, President Bush, and even before that, the discussion back on Lebanon with President Reagan, et cetera. So it is something I have dealt with a lot. It doesn’t mean I am right about it, but I have thought a lot about it. Now, there is a school of thought that is emerging within the administration that is making not illegitimate an intellectually thought out claim that the power of the Executive in times of war exceed that of what I would argue a majority of the constitutional scholarship has suggested. The fellow, who is a very bright guy, who is referred to as the architect of the President’s memorandum on the ability of Presidents to conduct military operations against terrorists and nations supporting them is Professor Yoo. He has written a book called, ‘‘The Power of War and Peace,’’ and he makes some claims that are relatively new among the constitutional scholars in his book and he urges, and he had urged when he was at the administration, the President had these authorities.

For example, he says that the framing generation well understood that declarations of war were obsolete. He goes on to say, given this context, it is clear that Congress’s power to declare war does not constrain a President’s independent and plenary right and constitutional authority over the use of force. And he goes on and he argues, as you well know this argument, I mean, not from your court, just as an informed, intelligent man, there is a great debate now of whether the administration’s internal position is correct, and that is the President has the authority to go to war absent congressional authorization. It was a claim made by Bush I and then dropped. Bush I dropped that the only reason the ‘‘declare war’’ provision is in the Constitution is to give the President the authority to go to war if the President didn’t want to. That was the claim made. A similar claim is made here.
So I want to ask you a question. Do you think the President has the authority to invade Iran tomorrow without getting permission from the people, from the United States Congress, absent him being able to show there is an immediate threat to our national security?
Judge ALITO. Well, that is a question that I don’t think is settled by—the whole issue of the extent of the President’s authority to authorize the use of military force without congressional approval has been the subject of a lot of debate. The Constitution divides the powers relating to making war between the President and the Congress. It gives Congress the power to declare war, and obviously, that means something. It gives Congress the power of the purse, and obviously military operations can’t be carried out for any length of time without congressional appropriations. Congress is given the power to raise and support an army, to maintain a navy, to make the rules for governing the land and the naval forces. The President has the power of the Commander in Chief. I think there has been general agreement, and the Prize cases support the authority of the President to take military action on his own in the case of an emergency, when there is not time for Congress to react—
Senator BIDEN. Is that the deciding question, that the Congress does not have the time to act?
Judge ALITO. Well, the Prize cases, I think, go—are read to go as far as to say that in that limited circumstance, the President can act without congressional approval. A lot of scholars say that what is important as far as congressional approval is not the form, it is not whether it is a formal declaration of war or not, it is whether there is authorization in one form or another. The War Powers Resolution was obviously an expression of the view on the part of Congress—
Senator BIDEN. If I can interrupt, Judge, since I am not going to have much time, the War Powers Resolution is a legislative Act. I don’t want to get into that. I am talking about the war clause. The administration argues and Yoo argues that, quote, ‘‘I do not think the President is constitutionally required to get legislative authorization for launching military hostilities.’’ That is a pretty central question. That means the President, if that interpretation is taken, the President could invade—and maybe there is good reason to— invade Iraq—I mean, invade Syria tomorrow, or invade Iran tomor-

row without any consultation with the U.S. Congress. That is a pretty big deal. Up to now, Fisher and Hencken and most of the scholarship here has said, no, no, no, the President’s authority falls into the zone where he needs it for emergency purposes, where he doesn’t have time to consult with the Congress.
But you seem to be agreeing with the interpretation of the President—Professor Yoo that says, no, the President has the authority if he thinks it is necessary to move from a state of peace to a state of war without any congressional authorization. Am I—
Judge ALITO. I hope I am not giving you that impression, Senator—
Senator BIDEN. Oh, OK. Maybe you can clarify. Judge ALITO.—because I didn’t mean to. I didn’t mean to say that. I have not read Professor Yoo’s book or anything that he or anyone else has written setting out the theory that you described. I have been trying to describe what I understand the authorities to say in this area. Generally, when this issue has come up, or variations of this issue have come up in relation to a number of recent wars—there were a number of efforts to raise issues relating to this in relation to the war in Vietnam. There was an effort to raise it in relation to our military operations in the former Yugoslavia. In most of those instances, they didn’t—most of those instances were the cases were dismissed by the lower courts under the so-called political question doctrine— Senator BIDEN. As you and I know, that is a different issue. The political question doctrine is a different issue than whether or not you think that—I am asking you as a citizen whether you think that, as the administration is arguing—for example, it argues that the case is made, and I am quoting, that ‘‘the Constitution permits the President to violate international law when he is engaged in war.’’ It just states that, flatly, that is what the memorandum of the Justice Department states flatly. The President has that sole authority. He argues that the Congress could have that authority, as well, just violate international law. He goes on to argue, as does the memorandum argue, this is this administration’s position, so that is why it is relevant. It says that the President may use his Commander in Chief and Executive power to use military force to protect a nation subject only to the congressional appropriations. That means that the argument the administration is making is the only authority that Congress has is to cut off funds. Let us say we didn’t want the President to invade Iran. The administration argues, we could pass a resolution saying, ‘‘You have no authority to invade Iran.’’ and the President could say and the next day invade Iran. Our only recourse would be to cut off appropriations. But as you know, there is no way to cut off specific appropriations. You would have to cut off appropriations for the entire military, which means it is a totally useless tool for the Congress in today’s world. You can’t say, well, I am going to cut off only the money for the oil that allows the steaming of the ships to get from the East Coast to the Mediterranean Sea and/or to the Persian Gulf. So it is really kind of important whether or not you think the President does not need the authority of the U.S. Congress to wage

a war where there is not an imminent threat against the United States, and that is my question.
Judge ALITO. And Senator, if I am confirmed and if this comes before me, or perhaps it could come before me on the court of appeals, the first issue would be the political question doctrine that I have described. But if we were to get beyond that, what I can tell you is that I don’t have—I have not studied these authorities and it is not my practice to just express an opinion on a constitutional question, including particularly one that is as momentous as this. I set out my understanding of what the Congress—what the Constitution does in allocating powers relating to war between the Executive and Congress and what some of the leading authorities have said on this question. But beyond that—and I haven’t read Professor Yoo’s book or anything that he has written on this issue—I would have to study the question.
Senator BIDEN. Thank you. Let me move to something you have spoken about, stare decisis. I know it has been raised a number of times. That is basically following precedent. As a circuit court of appeals judge, in layman’s language, what does that mean, as a circuit court of appeals judge, what does it mean, you are required to adhere to stare decisis?
Judge ALITO. We are required to follow decisions of the Supreme Court, to start out with, because it’s a superior court. We are— when we sit as a panel, it is our practice, and I think it’s the practice of all the courts of appeals, that one panel can’t overrule a decision of another panel, so it means that when we sit en banc, it is a doctrine that counsels adherence to prior precedent.
Senator BIDEN. But you are allowed, like you did in ACLU v. Schundler, you concluded, which I think you had a right to do, that the precedent of your circuit was incorrect and you ruled the other way. I mean, I think you have the right to do that—
Judge ALITO. We can’t do that at the panel level. We can’t say a prior panel decision is incorrect.
Senator BIDEN. But you can when you sit en banc— Judge ALITO. Oh, when we sit en banc— Senator BIDEN.—when all the justices are there. Judge ALITO. That’s correct. Senator BIDEN. OK. Now, how about when a Supreme Court Justice, a Supreme Court Justice is not required, is he or she, to follow the precedent of the Supreme Court? Stare decisis doesn’t apply there, does it? It may be practice, but as a practical matter, most scholars say you are required as a Supreme Court Justice to adhere to precedent, is it? Judge ALITO. Well, stare decisis certainly applies. Stare decisis takes different forms. There is what some people call horizontal stare decisis, which means a lower court has to follow the higher court—I am sorry, vertical stare decisis. And then are various forms of horizontal stare decisis, which means a court either must or should follow its own prior precedents. And on the Supreme Court, of course, when we are talking about whether the Supreme Court is going to follow a prior Supreme Court precedent, that is horizontal. There, it isn’t an absolute requirement to follow a prior precedent— Senator BIDEN. It is not an absolute—

601
Judge ALITO. It is not an absolute requirement, but it is the presumption that the Court will follow its prior precedents—
Senator BIDEN. No, I understand that, but no one would argue that if you or any other Justice clearly broke from the precedent of a Supreme Court decision, that you are in any way violating your ethical responsibility as a judge. You are entitled to do that, not that you would, but you are entitled to do that and no one would question that as a matter of right, is that not correct?
Judge ALITO. Well, I think people would question it if you disregarded the factors that go into the stare decisis analysis. If you said, I don’t believe in—you know, I am not absolutely required to follow prior Supreme Court precedent and I regard every question as a completely open question—
Senator BIDEN. Well, I doubt—with all due respect, the way it would likely take the form is a Justice would say, ‘‘I disagree with the line of cases that say that.’’ you know, ‘‘a President needs congressional authority.’’ or that a—whatever the line of cases are. They are not likely to say, ‘‘I disregard stare decisis.’’ It is like what Scalia said in the abortion issue. He said, we should just look at this head-on. Roe v. Wade is wrongly decided. We should just say so. And he is entitled to do that, and if he had a majority—I am not suggesting what you would do on that—he is entitled to do that and that wouldn’t be a violation of any written or unwritten code that relates to a Supreme Court Justice’s conduct, would it?
Judge ALITO. Different Justices and different judges have different views about stare decisis, but my view is that you need a special justification for overruling a prior precedent and that reliance and reaffirmation are among the factors that are important. But I have also said it is not an inexorable command. In the area of constitutional law, there has to be the ability to revisit a case like Plessy v. Ferguson. I don’t think anybody would want a system of stare decisis that made that impossible.
Senator BIDEN. My time is almost gone. I have a few minutes left. I would like to try to get quickly to another area here, if I may, that you have been questioned on, this whole notion of unitary Executive and the questions referencing Morrison and the dissent of Scalia, et cetera.
As I reach and teach the dissent of Scalia, he—and I won’t take the time, in the interest of time, to read his exact language—he has a very scathing and intellectually justifiable, many would argue, criticism of the test employed by the majority in that case as to determine whether separation of powers has been breached. He argues there are very bright lines, that there can be no sharing of any of the power. If it is an Executive power, it is an Executive power and it is Executive power. He would argue that the alphabet agencies, the FDA, the FCC, the EPA, they are really not constitutionally permissible because the FDA makes a legislative judgment, it makes a judicial judgment, and it imposes fines and penalties, so therefore it does all three things and is sort of the bastard child.
But the majority of the Justices say that as long as the power one branch is using does not unduly trench upon the power of the other branch, or it does not substantially affect its ability to carry out its powers, then that is permissible. Which school of thought do you fall into?

Judge ALITO. Different issues are presented in different factual situations—
Senator BIDEN. That is why I didn’t give you a specific issue. Judge ALITO. Well, I think you need a specific issue in order to answer it. For example— Senator BIDEN. OK, the FDA. Is it constitutional, the Food and Drug Administration? Judge ALITO. I don’t know that there are—I don’t know whether there are statutory restrictions on the removal of the FDA Commissioner. Senator BIDEN. No, but there are. The FDA does exercise judicial power. It makes judgments. You, Drug Company A, violated the law— Judge ALITO. And I don’t know any constitutional objection to that. Senator BIDEN. Well, Scalia. Judge ALITO. I don’t know that he would have a constitutional objection to that. My understanding is that he would not have a constitutional objection to their doing that, but I could be mistaken, and I wouldn’t want to prejudge any constitutional question that might be presented to me. But I am not aware of a constitutional— if there isn’t any limitation on removal, then there obviously isn’t a removal issue there. As to the agencies where there are restrictions on the removal of commissioners who are appointed for a term, that issue was dealt with within Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener and in Morrison, and Morrison was eight-to-one and the other cases would be sort of a fortior from Morrison. Senator BIDEN. My time is up, and hopefully, someone will pursue this unitary Executive issue about private suits, because I think what you explained was a little inconsistent, or I don’t understand it, but I will let someone else do that. Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. Senator Grassley has asked that his time be reserved. Senator Grassley has other duties which he had to attend to. He was here earlier and will be back. He is also Chairman of the Finance Committee. Just a word. When Senators come and go, everybody has many committees and many constituents and many visitors and many callers. So when they are not here, you can conclude they are otherwise engaged, and Senator Grassley is now. But his time is reserved. Senator Kohl has asked for 20 minutes. Senator Kohl, we will set the clock at 20 minutes for you, and as I said earlier, we have some flexibility here. Senator KOHL. I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Judge Alito, elected officials make decisions on issues every day as we try to best represent the people of our States. And if our constituents do not think that the choices that we make reflect their opinions, then every few years they have an opportunity to vote for someone else. As you know, that is not the case with the courts. Once confirmed, Federal judges have lifetime tenure and are virtually unaccountable. And that lifetime tenure can result in a judge or in a court that is removed from the thoughts and opinions of most

Americans. As public opinion changes on an issue, the court may cease to reflect the views of the country.
If the courts take positions contrary to what most Americans think about an issue or decide a case, a very important case, in a way that is clearly out of the mainstream of American thought, what can be done about it? And do you think that the courts need to consider public opinion when deciding cases?
Judge ALITO. I think that the courts were structured the way they are so that they would not decide their cases based on public opinion. If the Framers had wanted the Federal courts to follow public opinion, then they would have made Federal judges elected officials, as they are in—as State judges are in many States. They gave them lifetime tenure because they thought there was a critical difference between deciding cases under the Constitution and the laws and responding to public opinion.
Now, they gave the courts limited authority because they wanted most of the decisions that affect people’s daily lives to be made by the branches of Government that are directly responsible to the people, so that the people can control their own destiny. The Framers’ theory was that sovereignty lay with the people and the Government was legitimate only insofar as it responded to the people. And that’s why Congress is structured the way it is; that’s why the Presidency is structured the way it is. But the courts were viewed—courts are not a democratic institution, and they were structured the way they are because they saw a difference between the judicial function and the other functions that are performed by the branches of the Federal Government.
Senator KOHL. Well, and yet the courts, particularly the Rehnquist Court has struck down more laws than any court in recent memory. In response to your comment about the legislatures as being involved in the daily lives of people, and the rate that they have been striking down laws during the Rehnquist Court was 6 times faster than during the first 200 years of our Republic. So how do we deal with the fact that while the legislature in your opinion is supposed to represent the daily lives of people, the courts, particularly the Supreme Court in recent years has been striking down the laws of the legislature more often than ever before?
Judge ALITO. Acts of Congress are presumptively constitutional, and I don’t think that’s just—that saying that is just words. I think that means something. Members of Congress take an oath to support the Constitution, and I think that the presumption of constitutionality means a lot. And I think that judgments that are reached by the legislative branch in the form of findings of fact, for example, are entitled to great respect because of the structure of our Government, the fact that the basic policy decisions are supposed to be made by the legislative branch and carried out by the executive branch, and also for the practical reason or the functional reason that Congress is in a better position to evaluate conditions in our country and conditions in our society and to make findings and to determine what’s appropriate to deal with the social and economic problems that we face.
So I would certainly approach the question of determining whether an Act of Congress is constitutional with a heavy pre-

sumption in favor of the constitutionality of what Congress has done.
Now, ultimately Marbury v. Madison decided the question that when a case or controversy comes before the Supreme Court and the constitutionality of an Act of Congress is challenged, it is the duty of the Court to decide the question. Unless we were going to back to 1819, then that’s the practice that the Federal courts have to follow. But they should always do that with an appreciation of their limited role and the role that the legislature is supposed to play.
Senator KOHL. All right. Well, as a followup to that, would you comment on term limits for Federal judges or age limits for Federal judges? As you know, if a judge so wishes, he or she can serve forever. Do you think that is a good thing in our society? Should judges be term-limited? Should judges at least be age-limited? Or should they serve just as long as they wish?
Judge ALITO. Well, those are issues that are decided by the Constitution. The Framers said that Federal judges have life tenure, so without amending the Constitution, I don’t think you could have judges serve for a term of years or impose an age limitation on Federal judges?
Senator KOHL. Well, what is your opinion? Judge ALITO. I’m not really sure. I understand the arguments in favor of doing both of those things, and State courts do that, and although I said yesterday I didn’t think we should look to foreign law in interpreting our Constitution, I don’t see a problem in looking to the practices of foreign countries in the way they organize their constitutional courts. And I believe that many of them do have term limitations on the length of service of a member of the highest court and other members of the judiciary. So there are arguments on both sides of the question. If you had a short term of years, you would have a judiciary that was like an elected judiciary, and you would have the advantages and the disadvantages of that kind of structure. But there are arguments on both sides of the question, and it is for other people to decide, not for a member of the judiciary. Senator KOHL. Right. We are asking you—you know, I appreciate that and I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but, again, this is the only time—today may be the last time that we ever have a chance as a Nation to talk to you. So you have thought on it. I mean, I can’t believe you don’t have a thought. You know, we are not going to amend the Constitution tomorrow based on your thought that you express today. But what is your thought? Do you think it is a good thing for judges to serve unaccountably forever, with no age limits, no term limit? Or do you think it might be the best thing for our society, for judges after a reasonably long period of time, if you so wish, or at a certain age, to phase themselves out? Judge ALITO. If I had been a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787—which is a little hard for me to imagine, but if I had been there, and knowing the way things work out, I guess I would narrow the range of possibilities down to—the range of options that I would consider down to either life tenure or a long term of years so that the judiciary would be insulated from being swayed by popular opinion during a particular period

as to the constitutional questions that come before them, and as between those I’m not sure which I would choose.
If the judiciary is going to exercise the power of judicial review in enforcing constitutional rights, then I would think that one of those two options would be the best. But I wasn’t in Philadelphia in 1787, so I had no say on that question.
Senator KOHL. Judge, at the end of its term last year, in a 5– 4 decision the Supreme Court ruled in Kelo v. City of New London that it was constitutional for local government to seize private property for private economic development. Many people are alarmed about the consequences of this ruling because, in the words of Justice O’Connor, under the logic of the Kelo case, ‘‘nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.’’
So what is your view of the Kelo decision, Judge Alito? Judge ALITO. Well, what I can say is that it’s a precedent of the Court, and it built on the Midkiff decision which had been handed down a number of years earlier. I know that it touches some very sensitive nerves. When someone’s home is being taken away using the power of eminent domain, that is a blow to a lot of people. Even if they’re going to get compensated at fair market value for their home, the home often means more to people than just dollars and cents. It’s a place that often involves a lot of emotion. They have emotional attachments to it. They’ve lived in it a long time. They’re familiar with the neighborhood. They want to be with the neighbors. They want to stay in the same area. They may have emotional attachments to things in the home. So it is a tremendous blow, and I suppose that when—I would imagine that when someone’s home is being taken away, a modest home, for the purpose of building a very expensive commercial structure, that is particularly galling. But Kelo was a decision of the Court, and I’ve discussed my view about stare decisis, and should that issue come up again, then obviously the stare decisis factors would have to be, you know, considered as the first—the stare decisis question would have to be the first question addressed, and the factors that I’ve discussed would have to be weighed. Senator KOHL. Well, your comment is on the one hand and on the other hand, and I do appreciate that. But I would ask you if you would venture an opinion more precisely. Specifically, do you agree in general with Justice O’Connor’s dissent? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I don’t think I can answer that beyond what I have said. If the issue were to come before me if I’m confirmed, then I would first have to consider whether there’s any reason for not following Kelo, which is a precedent of the Supreme Court and grew out of the earlier precedent that I discussed, that I mentioned. Now, I’m not suggesting which way I would decide that question of stare decisis, but that is the way our legal system works, that decisions are presumptively to be followed, and I would have to address that question. And if I got beyond it, I would have to go through the whole judicial process that is set up so that questions of constitutional law and other questions are decided in the best way, and reading the briefs, listening to the arguments, partici-

pating in the conference, and only that reaching a decision on the merits of it.
Senator KOHL. All right. As a followup, Judge Alito, if confirmed, you will be replacing Justice O’Connor, who is a Justice who will be remembered by history as one of the most influential justices of the 20th century. She is also, as you know, a much beloved person. How would you be different from her, Judge Alito? How do you think Justice O’Connor ought to be remembered, Judge Alito? And how are you like or not like Justice O’Connor as a judge?
Judge ALITO. She certainly will be remembered for many reasons, and I think with great admiration by—I think she is held in great admiration by the American people at this time, and I think that when people look back, they will have great admiration for her work. She obviously was a pioneering figure and was an inspiration for many people who want to pursue legal careers, and other careers.
She has been a very dedicated Justice and has been known for her meticulous devotion to the facts of the particular cases that come before her and her belief that each case needs to be decided on its complex facts, and that’s something that is an important part of our judicial process.
I would try to emulate her dedication and her integrity, and her dedication to the case-by-case process of adjudication, which is what I think the Supreme Court and the other Federal courts should carry out. I think that’s one—that is a central feature of best traditions of our judicial system.
Senator KOHL. She was seen as someone who in a general way was at the center of the Court. You never had an idea whether she might look a little left or a little right, but she was seen as the center of the Court, which, as you know, is central to your nomination. And you have said you have great respect for her. You have said you respect her as a Justice who did look at the facts, made judgments based on those facts, which I think is what you would say about yourself, an umpire calling balls and strikes pretty much as they see them.
Do you see yourself as a Justice, if you are confirmed, who in many ways will fill the same role as Justice O’Connor has filled?
Judge ALITO. I think that anybody who is appointed to any judicial position has to be himself or herself, and I don’t think that anybody can try to replace the person, can duplicate the approach of the person that that person is replacing. We all have to proceed in accordance with our own abilities and our own outlook, so I don’t think that—I think we all have to be who we are. But I think we can emulate the great jurists of the past, which is not to say that we can equal them, but we can look at what they’ve done and see the things that they’ve done very well, try to approach what they’ve done in various areas. And I think that I certainly would try to emulate Justice O’Connor in the ways that I’ve described. I wouldn’t flatter myself to say that I could equal her in any of those ways, but I would certainly try to emulate the way in which she has gone about the conscientious and dedicated and dignified way in which she’s gone about the performance of her judicial duties.
Senator KOHL. You may have answered this question already, but as I said, she was at the center of the Court, at least viewed

as a person at the center of the Court, and served a very useful purpose in that respect. Is it, in your opinion, like that you might turn out in a general way to be that kind of a Justice?
Judge ALITO. I can only answer that really by saying what I think I’ve said before, which is that I’d be the same sort of Justice on the Supreme Court that I’ve been a judge—as I’ve been a judge on the court of appeals. I am my own person with whatever abilities I have and whatever limitations I have, and I think if anybody looks at my record on the court of appeals, they can get an idea about the way I approach the work of being a judge, and that is what I would try to do on the Supreme Court. And I don’t think I can do anything other than that, and that’s what I think I should do, and that’s what I would do if I am confirmed.
Senator KOHL. Judge Alito, I thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kohl. We will take our break now and resume at 10 minutes after 11. [Recess 10:55 a.m. to 11:10 a.m.] Chairman SPECTER. Welcome back, Judge Alito. A thought just crossed my mind that this is the only time when you walk into a room that everybody does not stand up. Judge ALITO. That happens to me all the time at home, Senator. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. I am not saying when you come home, Judge Alito. The reception for a judge or a Senator or even the Chief Justice is very different at home than when he walks into a room and a bailiff shouts ‘‘All rise.’’ Just crossed my mind that we were not all standing up. As Chief Justice Roberts said, this is a discussion among equals, that is, until you are confirmed, if confirmed. Senator Kyl? Senator KYL. Mr. Chairman, I will reserve my questions for now, thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kyl is reserving his time. Senator Feinstein is about the join us, coming in, so we will await her arrival, which should be imminently. [Pause.] Chairman SPECTER. I think Senator Feinstein is going to be a few moments more, so let us turn to Senator Feingold. Senator FEINGOLD. Mr. Chairman, if that is your wish. I certainly defer to Senator Feinstein if she wants to reclaim her time when she comes, but I will get started if you want. Chairman SPECTER. Let us wait another minute or two for her. She is not in the back room and she is not in the corridor, but let us wait another minute or two for her. [Pause.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Feinstein, you have made another dramatic entrance. We were all assembled for the Committee action on Chief Justice Roberts when you were on the floor from your position on the Appropriations Committee, managing a bill and 17 of us were there. Senator FEINSTEIN. Not quite, but I thank you for the excuse. Chairman SPECTER. And you walked in with drama as today. You have asked for up to 10 minutes, Senator Feinstein. We will

set the clock at 10 minutes. I have indicated we have some flexibility. We see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Senator FEINSTEIN. I may take 20 if that is all right with you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. We will reset the clock at 20, Senator Feinstein.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Good morning, Judge Alito. Judge ALITO. Good morning. Senator FEINSTEIN. I want to begin a conversation, hopefully. Let me try to set the precedent for it because others have discussed this as well. You said, and I think everybody agrees, that nobody is above the law, and nobody is beneath the law, and you made comment about the balance of powers, that all branches of Government are equal. There are three of us on this Committee, Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine and myself, that also serve on the Intelligence Committee, and Intelligence has the duty to provide the oversight for the 15 different agencies that relate to America’s intelligence activities. So this question of Presidential authority at a time of crisis, not necessarily a full declaration of war, state to state, but a time of crisis becomes very prescient right now. And I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the President’s plenary authorities as Commander in Chief, plenary meaning unrestrained and unrestrainable, his plenary authorities to defend the United States, and whether it is true that no law passed by Congress binds him if he determines that it interferes with his Commander in Chief role. Now, we have explicit powers, as you have said, under the Constitution, and in section 8 we have the explicit power to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a Navy, to make rules for the Government, and regulation of the land and naval forces, and the National Security Administration, known as the NSA, is within the Department of Defense. It is headed by a general. So it would seem to me that there is an explicit power for the Congress to be able to pass the rules that govern the procedures of the National Security Administration. Now, again to the Jackson test. When the President’s power is the least is when the Congress has legislated, and this is where the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA, comes in. FISA is very explicit, and let me read a part of it to you. ‘‘Procedures in this chapter and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA, shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of such Act, and the interception of domestic wire and oral communications may be conducted.’’ It does provide—you used the word ‘‘general.’’ It does provide two exigent circumstances: one, following a declaration of war, the President has 15 days in which he can wiretap; the second exigent circumstance is an emergency provision that if he needs emergency authority, the Attorney General can authorize it, provided they go to the FISA Court within 72 hours. I was concerned—there are two questions in this one statement. The first question is: if we have explicit authority under the Constitution to pass a law, and we pass that law, is the President

609
bound by that law, or does his plenary authority supersede that law?
Judge ALITO. The President, like everybody else, is bound by statutes that are enacted by Congress unless the statutes are unconstitutional, because the Constitution takes precedence over a statute. But in general, of course, the President and everybody else, is bound by a statute. There’s no question about that whatsoever. And the President is explicitly given the obligation, under Article II, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. So he is given the responsibility of making sure that the laws are carried out.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me press you on unconstitutional, and a very few of us on this Committee are not lawyers. I am one of them, so let me just speak in common everyday terms. There are two resolutions that were passed, one authorizing the use of military force involving Iraq, and one involving use of terrorism. Never was there any indication that domestic wiretapping of Americans was involved in anything that was done. As a matter of fact, the former minority leader just wrote an Op-Ed piece, in which he said he was approached by the administration shortly before the second resolution was passed, and asked to add certain words that essentially—added the words ‘‘deter and preempt any future acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States.’’ and he refused to do it.
Mr. Chairman, if I could place this statement in to record. Since we are going to be having hearings on what has happened, I think this is an appropriate bit of legislative history. I would like to place it in the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. It will be made a part of the record without objection.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. So bottom line, two resolutions passed, no consideration by the Congress or any member that I know of, no legislative history to indicate that we included in these authorizations, authorization to wiretap Americans. The question then comes, I guess, does the plenary power of the President supersede this? Judge ALITO. I think there are two questions. Maybe there are more than two questions, but there are at least two questions. The first question, to my mind, is a question of statutory interpretation, what is the scope of the authorization of the use of military force? I don’t know whether that will turn out to be an easy question or whether it will turn out to be a difficult question, but it is a question of statutory interpretation like any other. Of course, there’s a great deal at stake, and maybe a lot more at stake than is involved in a lot of issues of statutory interpretation. But if I were required to decide that, I would approach it in essentially the same way I approach any other question of statutory interpretation, what does the word of the law—what does the law say? Are there terms in there that carry a special meaning because of the subject matter that’s being dealt with? And I think legislative history can be appropriately consulted. And I would have to decide that in the context of the whole process of deciding legal questions, as I said, like any other issue of statutory interpretation.

610
Once a decision was reached on the issue of statutory interpretation, it might be necessary to go further, depending on, I guess, the answer to that question.
I would also say in connection with this that we have a little bit of guidance as to the interpretation of the authorization of the use of military force in the Hamdi case, where the Court interpreted that enactment, and determined that the detention of an individual who was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan fell within the scope of that, and they relied there, I think, on customary practices in the conduct of warfare in determining what fell within the scope of the authorization.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me stop you right here, because now— that is right, because detention is a necessary following of an authorization of military force. So detention is logical. When you have a specific statute that covers all electronic surveillance, the question comes, is that statute nullified, and does it necessarily follow that the wiretapping of Americans without—and I am not saying there is not a reason to do this. What I am saying is that we set up a legal procedure by which you do it, and we set two exigent circumstances to excuse a President from having to do it, therefore, doesn’t that law prevail?
Judge ALITO. Well, as I said, I think the threshold question is interpreting the scope of that, and it might turn out to be an open and shut argument, it might turn out to be a very complicated argument. I wouldn’t presume to issue—to voice an opinion on the question here, in particular because I haven’t studied it in the depth that I would have to study it before reaching a judicial decision on the matter. Then depending on how that issue was resolved, it might be necessary to go on to the constitutional question, and I think you’ve exactly outlined where that would fall under Justice Jackson’s method of analyzing these questions. This would be in the category in which—well, if it was determined that there wasn’t statutory authorization, then—
Senator FEINSTEIN. There was. Judge ALITO. Well, if it was determined that there was— Senator FEINSTEIN. No statutory authorization to wiretap, right. Judge ALITO. If it was determined that there was statutory authorization, then I don’t know what the constitutional would— Senator FEINSTEIN. But if there was not? Judge ALITO. There would still potentially be—there might be a constitutional issue. Let me stop there. There would be a Fourth Amendment issue, obviously. If you went beyond—if you determined that there wasn’t statutory authorization, then as far as whether—then as far as the issue of Presidential power is concerned, you would be in Justice Jackson’s scheme in the category where the President—you would have to determine, if this is the argument that’s made, whether the President’s power, inherent powers, the powers given to the President under Article II, are sufficient, even taking away congressional authorization, the area where the President is asserting a power to do something in the face of explicit, an explicit congressional determination to the contrary. Senator FEINSTEIN. Now, in my lay mind, the way I interpret that—and correct me if I am wrong—is that you essentially have
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00622 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

611
a conflict, and that it has not been decided whether one trumps the other.
Judge ALITO. I think that’s close to the point that I was trying to make. The way Justice Jackson described it was that you have whatever Executive power the President has, minus what Congress has taken away by enacting the statute.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Even though you have a statutory prohibition, even a criminal prohibition?
Judge ALITO. Well, I’m not suggesting how the determination would come out. I think it’s—that it is implicit in the way Justice Jackson outlined this that Presidential—well, he said it expressly— Presidential power is at its lowest in this situation, where the President is claiming the authority to do something that Congress has prohibited.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Enough of that. Let me move on. In W.R. Grace v. the EPA, a chemical company released large amounts of ammonia into the local aquifer in Lansing, Michigan. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA ordered the chemical company to clean up the discharge to reduce the concentration of ammonia to a level that wouldn’t threaten the health of the community. The chemical company challenged this EPA decision. You cast, as I understand it, the decisive vote to overrule the EPA, permitting the company to leave more ammonia in the aquifer, despite the EPA’s determination that this level of ammonia would continue to endanger the water supply. In her dissent, Judge Mansmann urged deference to the EPA in matters of science, noting that, ‘‘The high degree of deference we are to accord the EPA is a cornerstone to the EPA’s power enshrined in the Safe Drinking Water Act to protect the public health, the environment and public water supplies from the pernicious effects of toxic wastes.’’ Do you agree with the dissent that a reviewing court must generally be at its most deferential when reviewing factual determinations within an agency’s special area of expertise? Judge ALITO. I do agree with that. I don’t think there is any question about that. Senator FEINSTEIN. Do you believe that where an agency is taking action to protect the health of citizens, additional deference should be given? Judge ALITO. I think that deference is owed to the expertise of administrative agencies. That is an important part of administrative law, and when you are dealing with an agency like the EPA, you would defer to their area of expertise. I think that is correct. Senator FEINSTEIN. Should the EPA be accorded the same deference as other governmental agencies? Judge ALITO. I don’t think—I don’t see why it should not. It is the expert on environmental questions and where the APA—I am sorry, the EPA—for example, if the EPA issues regulations interpreting a statutory provision and it is given broad authority under the environmental laws frequently to implement choices that are reflected in the legislation, then I think that it is entitled to a broad measure of deference under the Chevron decision. If it issues rules, then any reasonable interpretation of the rules—I am sorry—of the statute is entitled to deference from the courts.

612
Senator FEINSTEIN. OK. Let me go way back, and I recognize that time has gone by and I recognize you were in a different position, but these questions are really aimed to point out the importance of the Commerce Clause to us.
In 1986, Congress passed the Truth in Mileage Act to prevent odometer fraud. As deputy at the Office of Legal Counsel, you recommended that President Reagan veto the bill because you believed it violated the principles of federalism. In a draft statement for the President, you wrote ‘‘It is the States and not the Federal Government that are charged with protecting the health, safety and welfare of their citizens.’’ That is a quote. President Reagan did sign the Truth in Mileage Act.
Does it remain your opinion that it is the States, not the Federal Government, that are charged with protecting the health, safety and welfare of Americans?
Judge ALITO. Both the Federal Government and the States have responsibilities in those areas. Historically, the primary responsibility with respect to that, to those concerns, has been with the States. But with the expansion of Federal regulatory programs, the Federal Government has taken on broader and broader responsibilities in those areas and now has very substantial responsibilities in all of those areas under regulatory schemes that have been in place for a long time and I don’t believe are being challenged on constitutional grounds at this time.
If I could just say a word about that memo, which I read for the first time in 20 years recently, as I—it is a brief statement and as I read it, it is based—what it is primarily expressing is not an interpretation of the scope of the Federal Government’s—of Congress’s constitutional authority, but a recommendation based on the federalism policies of the Reagan administration.
The Reagan administration had a policy of implementing its view of federalism concerns through policymaking decisions. In other words, its policy was to go further in respecting what it viewed as the Federalist system—as our Federal system of Government and the Constitution required to go further as a policy matter. And as I read that brief statement, that is what was being expressed there.
Senator FEINSTEIN. So if I understand that, quickly, what you are saying is this was written as staff in an administration to follow a policy. But are you also saying as a judge this would not necessarily be a position that you would hold in any case?
Judge ALITO. Well, as a judge, I would have no authority and certainly would not try to implement any policy ideas about federalism. Congress can implement policy ideas about federalism. The Garcia case, in fact, is based on the view that the primary— and this is what the Supreme Court said there, that the primary way in which the federalism concerns that were expressed in National League of Cities was to be implemented in the future was through policy decisions made by Congress.
They said the States are represented in Congress through the membership in the Senate, and protection of the prerogatives of the States should be left to policy decisions made by Congress, or decisions made by Congress in implementing its view of how the system of federalism should work.

613
And an Executive—a President can take a similar approach. A President can say although the Constitution allows the authority of the Federal Government to go this far, as a policy matter I don’t want to go along with legislation that goes up to the limits of what the Constitution allows; as a policy matter, I want to stop short of that. And as I read this memo, that is what we were saying there.
Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Feinstein. Senator Grassley has stated his interest in reclaiming some of his reserved time. Senator Grassley. Senator GRASSLEY. A small part of it, number one, to make a point that I hope would put a lot of my colleagues who have raised questions about some theory you might have about this or that— whatever political science theories you might have about the executive branch of Government, I don’t worry about that, and I would hope my colleagues wouldn’t worry about that because you could have a hundred theories and they could be all crazy. But is it not right that you are a person that is bound by the Constitution to only hear cases and controversies that come before the Supreme Court? And so, you know, whatever comes before you, you are responsible for deciding it within the constitutional of case and controversy. And, second, it seems to me that you are a person that has got the judicial temperament, as you said so many times, that you are going to keep your own personal views out of it. And it seems to me that you are person that has indicated to us that you are going to look at a case within the four corners of the law and the facts that apply to that case, and nothing more. So any theories you might have about—what was it called, unitary Executive or something? What has that got to do with your deciding a case? Judge ALITO. Senator, you are exactly right. If cases involving this area of constitutional law come before me, I will look to the precedents of the Supreme Court. And that is what I think I have been trying to emphasize, and there are governing precedents in this area. There is Humphrey’s Executor and Wiener, and most recently Morrison, which was an eight-to-one decision. Senator GRASSLEY. Then the other thing I would take an opportunity to just tell you something and not want any response, but that is on the False Claims Act. This Act was originally passed in 1862 because Lincoln didn’t have enough people to prosecute fraud by military people against the Government. So he empowered individuals to do that under qui tam. And then in 1942, I think it was, the law was gutted by taking out the qui tam provisions, probably because of World War II and the necessity of getting the job of military construction done. And then in the 1980s, we found a heck of a lot of military fraudulent use of taxpayers’ money. We held a lot of hearings on that. It came that there wasn’t enough being done by the Justice Department to take care of it. We saw the Justice Department making a lot of global settlements; you know, some company that had done a massive amount
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00625 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

614
of wrong in many areas and maybe having the Justice Department settle one little dispute, but give a global settlement so that they would never be prosecuted for anything after that. It led us to beefing up the False Claims Act by putting the qui tam provisions in it.
And it was a terrible thing to get through Congress. I think 6 months after we voted it out of Committee, we had every Senator putting a hold on it, some bequest of somebody in the defense industry. And you would take care of that little problem and another put a hold on and another one put a hold on. Finally, the last person was a friend of mine that had a hold on it and I said why did you have a hold on it? Well, some of my friends said that is bad for the defense industry.
And I talked to him about it and he says, you know, you are absolutely right, and we got the last hold off and we got it passed and we got it signed by the President of the United States. And then over the last several years, we have had the defense industry going trying to gut it again. Then we had the Hospital Association trying to gut it because we were using medical care.
And it has brought $12 billion into the Federal Treasury, and I think it has even had the benefit of discouraging a lot of activity that would go on normally that save the taxpayers money without prosecution. But there are people in the Justice Department, professional people in the Justice Department, who don’t want some citizen looking over their head and doing their job for them, when they aren’t doing it.
A district judge in the mid-1980s, or maybe it was the late 1980s, in, I think, a General Electric case someplace in Ohio, when the Justice Department was trying to cut back the award that the relator was going to get, said to this Justice Department guy, don’t you get it? You wouldn’t even have a case if it wasn’t for this whistleblower coming forth to make their statement and to make their case.
And, you know, it grown into quite a thing now. The only thing I regret about it is there are a lot of lawyers, tort attorneys out there getting rich off of it. But there is also a lot coming into the Federal Treasury, and about 15 percent if what it would cost the Federal Government anyway to bring in this same amount of money if they prosecuted. But they won’t prosecute it and they don’t know about all of it, and you have got to rely on the whistleblowers to get the information out there.
And so when you are in your private meetings that you have after you get on the Supreme Court and you are talking about these things, I hope you will remember that this was meant to serve a worthy purpose, is serving a worthy purpose, and I would like to have you look at it in a very unbiased way.
[Laughter.] Senator GRASSLEY. I reserve the rest of my time. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Alito, Senator Grassley is going to follow that up with a strong letter. [Laughter.] Senator GRASSLEY. Well, the Chairman remembers we even had to subpoena William French Smith one time in this whole process. Senator LEAHY. Chuck, I think we know where you stand on this.

Senator GRASSLEY. OK. Chairman SPECTER. To use a little bit more of my time, Senator Grassley did more than subpoena Attorney General William French Smith. He started proceedings to hold him in contempt, and that was at about a time when Attorney General Smith was inviting some members of the Judiciary Committee to have lunch. And he was very dour during the entire lunch as far as his attitude toward me and I found out why at the end of the lunch. He wanted to know why I wanted to hold him in contempt. He had insulted Senator Grassley to the nth degree by confusing me with him. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Tell your Anita Hill story, Chuck. Senator GRASSLEY. Well, just to show you how they get mixed up, you know, he asked the questions of Anita Hill and I was sitting beside him very quietly, because only two Republicans were going to ask questions. And I went back to my constituency and everybody said to me, you were awful to Anita Hill, you just treated her awful, because they got me mixed up with him. Chairman SPECTER. Wait. I didn’t know you were— [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. I didn’t know you were going to tell that part of the— Senator GRASSLEY. I thought that is the only part we have talked about. Chairman SPECTER. Judge, we are just trying to use a little time over here to give you just a little respite from the— Senator LEAHY. Arlen, fortunately none of this is on television so nobody knows what we are saying here with these stories. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Feingold, you haven’t told me how much time you would like to have. Senator FEINGOLD. I think 25 minutes, with flexibility. Maybe I won’t have to use it all. Chairman SPECTER. So granted. Set the clock to 25 minutes and you are recognized, Senator Feingold. Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, Judge. It is nice to talk to you in the morning for once, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to ask a third round of questions. I do appreciate the latitude on the time, if it is necessary. First, Judge, I want to thank you for arranging to have put together the list of people who participated in your practice sessions. I want to say that I am still somewhat troubled by the idea that you were prepared for this hearing by some lawyers who are very much involved in promoting the purported legal justification for the NSA wiretapping program, and obviously this issue of Presidential power is so central to this hearing. In fact, my first questions will also be about this, as well. I note, for example, that one of the people that participated in these sessions was Benjamin Powell. He recently advised President Bush on intelligence matters and was just given a recess appointment as General Counsel to the National Intelligence Director. I also see the name of White House Counsel Harriet Miers on the

616
list, and she obviously is involved in the President’s position on this matter.
So I am just going to continue to think about this issue and I hope that you and the Department will, too. I think you would agree that at some point in a situation like this, an ethical issue could arise.
Let me go back, though, to what many Senators have asked you about, including most recently Senator Feinstein. I want to try again to clarify this issue, the constitutional authority of the President to violate a criminal statute. You have said repeatedly that the President is not above the law, but you have also been very careful to qualify this statement by saying that the President must always follow the Constitution and laws that are consistent with the Constitution, and that statement sounds good until you look at it real closely. After all, everyone agrees that the President must follow constitutional law. The question is whether Presidents can claim inherent powers under the Constitution that allow them in certain cases to violate a criminal law, and your formulation seems to leave open the possibility that the President can assert inherent authority to violate the criminal law and still be following, to use your words, the Constitution and laws that are consistent with the Constitution.
So I would like to ask you, assuming that you have already done phase one, step one, the statutory analysis, in your view, just because a law is constitutional as it is written, like a murder statute or FISA, that doesn’t actually answer the question of whether the President can violate it, does it?
Judge ALITO. I don’t think I would separate the constitutional questions into categories. I think it follows from the structure of our Constitution that the Constitution trumps the statute. That was the issue in Marbury v. Madison. It would be a rare instance in which it would be justifiable for the President or any member of the executive branch not to abide by a statute passed by Congress. It would be a very rare—
Senator FEINGOLD. But it is possible, based on your answer, that a statute that has been determined standing on its own to be constitutional could, in theory, run into some conflict with an inherent, as you would say, constitutional power of the President, which in theory, even under Justice Jackson’s test, could trump the seemingly constitutional criminal statute, is that correct?
Judge ALITO. Well, I’m not sure what standing on its own means there. Somebody gave an example in a law review article I remember reading of a statute that said that a particular named individual was to be immediately taken into custody by Federal law enforcement agents and taken immediately to a certain place to be executed. Would the President be bound to, under his responsibility to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, would the President be legally obligated to do that, even though it flies in the face of some of the most fundamental guarantees in the Constitution, and I think we would all say in a situation like that, no, the Constitution trumps the statutory enactment.
Senator FEINGOLD. But it is possible under your construct that an inherent constitutional power of the President could, under

some analysis or in some case, override what people believe to be a constitutional criminal statute—
Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t want to—I want to be very precise on this. What I have said, and I don’t think I can go further than to say this, is that that situation seems to be exactly what is—to fall exactly within that category that Justice Jackson outlined, where the President is claiming the authority to do something and the thing that he is claiming the authority to do is explicitly, has been explicitly disapproved by Congress. So his own taxonomy contemplates the possibility that says that there is this category and cases can fall in this category, and he seems to contemplate the possibility that that might be justified.
But I don’t want to even say that there could be such a case. I don’t know. I would have to be presented with the facts of the particular case and consider it in the way I would consider any legal question. I don’t think I can go beyond that.
Senator FEINGOLD. I understand that has been your position. I have heard the repeated references to Justice Jackson’s test. But all that test says in the end is that the President’s power is at the lowest ebb at that point, and I understand and obviously have enormous regard for Justice Jackson and that opinion in particular. But I think in this time it leaves me troubled.
I am concerned that if we are simply going to rely on that in the end without getting a better sense of where you might come down on these kind of matters, it really goes to the very heart of our system of government. And if somehow that—even if the President’s power is at a very low ebb at that point, I think it still leaves open the possibility of enough ambiguity and vagueness that could alter the basic balance between the Congress and the Presidential power in a way that could affect our very system of government.
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, this is a momentous constitutional issue and it is the kind of constitutional issue that generally is not resolved—well, let me say this, that it is often—it often comes up in a context that is not justiciable. But I think it would be irresponsible for me to say anything on the substance of the question here, and by not saying it, I don’t mean to suggest in any way how I would come out on the question. I don’t mean to suggest that there could be a case where it would be justified or not, particularly on an issue of this magnitude. I think anybody in my position can say no more than this is the framework that the Supreme Court precedents have provided for us, and when the issue comes up, if it comes up, if it comes before me, if it is justiciable, I will analyze it thoroughly, and that’s all I can say.
Senator FEINGOLD. And I respect your constraints in this regard, and frankly, this isn’t so much about you or your appointment. This is about the possibility you have raised that this may not be justiciable, which is going to be a very serious problem for our system of government. If the U.S. Supreme Court cannot help us resolve these issues because of justiciability issues, at a time of crisis like this in terms of the fight against terrorism, I think it raises one of the most important issues in the history of our country’s constitutional debate. I don’t think you disagree with that, but it really troubles me that the Supreme Court could possibly not help us resolve this.

Judge ALITO. And I don’t want to suggest that it is or it’s not justiciable. We would look to the Baker v. Carr factors, and that is something else that would be very irresponsible for me to express an opinion on in this forum and I want to make it perfectly clear that I’m not doing that.
Senator FEINGOLD. Do you think it could ever be constitutional to admit evidence obtained by torture against an individual who is being charged with a crime?
Judge ALITO. Well, the Fifth Amendment prohibits compelled self-incrimination and it’s long been established that evidence that is obtained through torture is inadmissible in our courts. That’s the governing principle.
Senator FEINGOLD. So I take that answer to mean it could not be constitutional to admit evidence obtained by torture against individuals being charged with a crime?
Judge ALITO. In all the contexts that I’m familiar with, that would be the answer.
Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you for that answer. I want to followup on one question that Senator Leahy asked this morning about the constitutionality of executing an innocent person. You said that the Constitution, of course, is designed to prevent that. We all agree on that. But let us say that the trial was procedurally perfect and there were no legal or constitutional errors, but later evidence proves that the person convicted was unquestionably innocent. Does that person have a constitutional right not to be executed?
Judge ALITO. The person has—would first have to avail himself or herself of the procedures that Congress has specified for challenging convictions after they’ve become final. If this individual has been convicted and has gone through the whole process of direct appeal, either in the State system or in the Federal system, then there are procedures. States have procedures for collateral attacks and there are procedures under Federal statutes for collateral attacks on Federal convictions and on State convictions. The person would have to go through the procedures that are set out in the statute.
The system is designed to prevent a person from being executed if the person is innocent, and actual innocence figures very importantly, even in these complex—in sometimes complex procedures that have to be followed in these collateral attacks. For example, usually, there’s this doctrine of procedural default, which is not something that ordinary people are familiar with, but it means that if a State prisoner is challenging a State conviction, the State prisoner has to take advantage of the procedures that are available under State law, and if the State prisoner doesn’t do that—
Senator FEINGOLD. My question assumes that all that has been done and the process went through and there is no legal or constitutional or procedural problems, but evidence suddenly proves that the person convicted was unquestionably innocent. The question is, does that person in that posture have a constitutional right not to be executed?
Judge ALITO. Well, then the person would have to, as I said, file a petition, and if it was an initial petition, it would fall into one category. If it was the second or a successive petition, it would fall

619
into another category and the person would have to satisfy the requirements that Congress has set out for filing a second or successive petition.
Senator FEINGOLD. You can’t say that the person has a constitutional right not to be executed?
Judge ALITO. Well, I have to know the specific facts of the case and the way it works its way through the legal system. The rules here are complicated. A person has a right. It is one of the most fundamental rights that anybody has. It is a fundamental right and a fundamental objective of our judicial system that nobody is to be convicted without proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If evidence—if there’s evidence that the person is not guilty of the offense, then that gets to the very heart of what our whole system of criminal justice is designed to address.
Senator FEINGOLD. I will stop on that topic, but I think there is a real question here. Simply because somebody is adjudicated guilty but they are, in fact, innocent, I would take the view that they still have a constitutional right not to be executed, but I am glad we could talk about that a bit.
Let me talk about affirmative action. In her opinion in Gruder v. Bollinger, Justice O’Connor recognized the, quote, ‘‘real world significance and impact’’ of affirmative action programs and policies, and she noted that American businesses need skills obtained through exposure to widely diverse people and cultures. A racially diverse officer corps is essential to the military’s ability to fulfill its mission to provide national security. And diversity in colleges and universities leads to diversity in civil society, which is, quote, ‘‘essential if the dream of one nation, indivisible, is to be realized.’’
Justice O’Connor expressly gave great weight to the views of military leaders, who said a highly qualified racially diverse military is essential. How much weight would you give to that view?
Judge ALITO. Well, I can speak to the issue of diversity in education from a little bit of my own experience. A couple of years ago, I taught, as an adjunct law professor at Seton Hall Law School, I taught a seminar on civil liberties and terrorism, because in the wake of terrorist attacks on 9/11, it became apparent to me that there were going to be a lot of civil liberties issues raised. It seemed to me that these were issues of the utmost importance, so I put together a seminar on the question.
The first time I conducted the class, we had an extremely—we had a class with people of extremely diverse backgrounds relating to this issue. There was a student who had been in the Special Forces in Bosnia. There was a student who was a Muslim from the Middle East. There were a number of students who had been personally affected by, in one way or another, by the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. There were students who felt very strongly about civil liberties. And having these people in the class with diverse backgrounds and outlooks on the issues that we were discussing made an enormous contribution to the class.
So in that setting, I have personal experience about how valuable having people with diverse backgrounds and viewpoints can be, and the Supreme Court has expressed the view that diversity is a compelling interest. Having a diverse student body is a compelling interest. Justice Powell voiced that back in the Bakke case and it’s
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00631 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

620
been reiterated in a number of cases and most prominently in— most recently in the Gruder case.
Senator FEINGOLD. In fact, in Gruder, seven of the nine Justices, all but Justices Scalia and Thomas, reaffirmed Justice Powell’s determination in the Bakke case that the State has a compelling interest in promoting diversity in the classroom. Do you think that increasing diversity in the classroom is a compelling State interest?
Judge ALITO. Well, I’ve spoken to my own personal experience about its importance in education and Gruder is a precedent that directly addressed this issue in the context of education. It’s the Supreme Court’s recent word on this issue.
Senator FEINGOLD. I hope you will think it fair that nothing about what you just said would suggest to me you think it is anything less than a compelling State interest.
Judge ALITO. It is a precedent and the Supreme Court has dealt with this over a period of time, and that’s the conclusion that they’ve drawn.
Senator FEINGOLD. On another subject, do you believe that Congress has the power under the Constitution to prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians in employment?
Judge ALITO. I would have to—I can’t think of a reason why Congress would not have that power, but I would have to be presented with the arguments.
Senator FEINGOLD. In 2001, you wrote an opinion overturning a public school district’s antiharassment policy, that protected, among other people, lesbian and gay students. You said the school policy in the case, Saxe v. State College Area School District, violated the First Amendment, and the case was brought by students who believed that the policy interfered with their ability to speak out against the ‘‘sinful’’ nature and harmful effects of homosexuality as compelled by their religion.
In your Senate questionnaire you note that you won the Family Research Council Golden Gavel Award in 2001 for your decision striking down that policy. The Family Research Council is a leading conservative group that opposes gay rights.
In order for a policy protecting gay students from harassment to pass constitutional scrutiny, must it have an exception for harassment motivated by religious belief?
Judge ALITO. Well, let me say what was at issue in the Saxe case because that’s the context in which I dealt with issues like this. The Saxe case involved a very broad antiharassment policy that had been adopted by a school district, and it prohibited the expression of—it not only prohibited the expression of political viewpoints, but it went so far as to say that just about anything that any student would say about another student that would be offensive to that student, including comments on the way the student dressed, or the things that they like to do, would be a violation of the antiharassment policy. And under the First Amendment, unlike in most other areas of the law, statutes can be challenged on overbreadth grounds, and that was the ground on which the statute was struck down in the Saxe case, that it was overly broad, that it prohibited a great deal of speech that was constitutionally protected.

621
The Supreme Court decided back in the Tinker case that students don’t lose all of their First Amendment rights to freedom of expression when they enter the school grounds, and Justice Brennan’s opinion in that case set out the test that is to be applied there, the schools have greater ability to regulate student speech than Government has to regulate adult speech in general, but the authority of school officials to regulate political speech by students—in Tinker it was the wearing of an arm band to protest the war in Vietnam—is not unlimited, and there has to be a threat of disturbance on the school grounds or a violation of the constitutional rights of another student. And so any policy that regulated student expression, political expression in a school, would have to satisfy Justice Brennan’s Tinker standard.
Senator FEINGOLD. Thank you, Judge. Does Congress have the authority to enact legislation that would protect gay students from harassment in schools that receive Federal funding?
Judge ALITO. That would fall within the South Dakota v. Dole standard, and the question would be whether the condition that’s attached to the receipt of the Federal funds is germane to the purpose of the funding, and that’s a standard that gives Congress a very broad authority.
Senator FEINGOLD. So that Congress does have the authority in general. The question would be the scope of it.
Judge ALITO. Congress has the authority to attach all sorts of conditions to the receipt of Federal money. It has to be clear so that the States understand what they’re getting into, that if you take this money there are conditions that go with it, but provided that that clear statement requirement is satisfied and provided that the condition is germane to the purpose of the funding, then Congress can attach conditions, and it could do so in this area.
Senator FEINGOLD. Judge, let me switch to an ethics issue that is not Vanguard. As you know, after your testimony concludes today, a number of outside witnesses are coming to testify about your nomination, including seven current and former judges from your court. As far as I know, this is the first time that sitting Federal judges have testified on behalf of a Supreme Court nominee. I am a little troubled by it. I hope to have some opportunity to question the judges about this, but I think it may raise something of an ethical issue for you. If you are confirmed to the Supreme Court, how would you analyze a possible recusal motion if an appeal on a case from one of those sitting judges testifying on your behalf were to come before you? Will you have to recuse yourself from any case where one of these judges was involved in the decision?
Judge ALITO. That’s not a question that I’ve given any thought to before this minute, Senator, so I don’t know that I could answer it, and I would want to answer any recusal question very carefully.
Senator FEINGOLD. Perhaps you could give me an answer after you have had a chance to think about it.
Judge ALITO. I’d certainly be happy to do that. Senator FEINGOLD. Appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, I think that is sufficient. Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Feingold.

We are on course to finish you before lunchtime, Judge Alito. We have more potential questions from the Republican side, and we have two more from the Democratic side.
Senator DeWine, do you have any questions? Senator DEWINE. Mr. Chairman, I will reserve my time. Chairman SPECTER. Senator DeWine reserves his time. Senator Schumer, you are recognized for up to 25 minutes. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. With our conversation that you are going to ask new questions. Senator SCHUMER. That is what I want to ask but— [Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. It is a new day. Senator SCHUMER. I think some of my old questions, ones I have asked before, should bother you. They bother me. But in any case, I do have a few other issues that I do want to talk to you about. The first is just a general question on Presidential power. Let’s just assume that it was found that the President’s right to wiretap people, the way we are discussing it now in terms of the recent NSA revelations, was found constitutional. Would there be a different standard if, say, the President—does that necessarily allow the President to then go ahead and go into people’s homes here in America, American citizens, without a warrant? Does the one necessarily lead to the other? Judge ALITO. I would have to understand the—I would have to see the ground for holding the wiretapping or the electronic surveillance constitutional before seeing whether it would apply in the case of other searches and seizures. Senator SCHUMER. But let’s assume it is constitutional. Judge ALITO. I’d have to know what the arguments were made about it and on what ground it was found to be constitutional. Senator SCHUMER. So it could follow, but might not; is that what you would say? Judge ALITO. It very well might not. I would have to know the constitutional ground for the decision relating to the wiretapping, and I have no idea what that would be. It might well not extend to things like physical searches of homes. Senator SCHUMER. Is there a difference? Is there a constitutional difference between a wiretap and an actual physical search of the home on Fourth Amendment grounds? Is there any that you know in cases— Judge ALITO. There are differences, yes, there certainly are. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. Judge ALITO. Wiretapping is subject to—general criminal wiretapping is subject to all the rules that are set out in Title III, which are thought to be based in large part on Fourth Amendment requirements. And the warrant requirement is very strong in the area of electronic surveillance. When you’re talking about other types of searches, the searches can take place in a variety of places for a variety of reasons. Senator SCHUMER. But if it can be done under the inherent power that the President has for the one, why could it not be done for the other? I am not asking about the statute.

623
Judge ALITO. There’s also a Fourth Amendment issue. Any search—
Senator SCHUMER. In both cases. Judge ALITO. In both cases, and the Fourth Amendment could play out very differently in those two contexts. Senator SCHUMER. Now I would like to go back to some of the line of questioning that Senator Durbin explored yesterday when he mentioned the crushing hand of fate, Bruce Springsteen. Judge Alito, I assume you believe that you will be able to be fair in every case that comes before you on the Supreme Court. Judge ALITO. I have no reason to think I will not be. I certainly will. Senator SCHUMER. And you do not believe that you prejudged any legal of constitutional issue? Judge ALITO. I don’t believe that I have. Senator SCHUMER. And you will take care to apply the rules of law and procedure equally and evenhandedly, no matter who the parties are, prosecution or defense? Judge ALITO. I certainly will, yes, Senator. Senator SCHUMER. Employer or employee. Judge ALITO. I will apply the laws evenhandedly to everyone. Senator SCHUMER. And I take it you it you believe that you have done just that on the Third Circuit while you were there? Judge ALITO. I believe I have. Senator SCHUMER. Yesterday Senator Durbin asked about Pirolli v. World Flavors, and you remember that case. You discussed it with Senator Durbin. And the case involves the claims of a mentally retarded man who brought suit against his employer for violent and persistent sexual harassment by his coworkers, am I right? Judge ALITO. Those were the claims. Senator SCHUMER. And the majority allowed the case to proceed, finding that the Court had ‘‘discretion to consider issues not raised in the brief.’’ And they did so to give the plaintiff his day in court. You exercised your discretion to vote against giving him his day in court because his lawyer failed to raise the argument in the brief. As you told Senator Durbin, ‘‘There is a very important principle involved in appellate practice’’—these are your words—‘‘I think it goes with the idea of judicial self-restraint, and that requires parties raise issues in the trial court, and that if they don’t raise the issue in the trial court, then absent some extraordinary circumstances, they shouldn’t be able to raise the issue on appeal.’’ and that was the principle there. Those are your words, right? Judge ALITO. I believe they are, yes. Senator SCHUMER. Now I would like to go to two other cases that you had when you were on the Third Circuit. The first one is Smith v. Horn, where a similar issue arose. That was a criminal case involving a habeas corpus petition brought by a criminal defendant, right? Judge ALITO. Yes, it was. Senator SCHUMER. And it turns out that in that case as well, just like Pirolli, one of the parties had failed to raise a relevant argument in its brief, right?

624
Judge ALITO. Well, Smith v. Horn was really not comparable to Pirolli for a very important reason. Smith v. Horn was a habeas case, and so what is involved there is not simply a dispute between private parties, and of course, disputes between private parties are very important, and individual rights can be involved.
Senator SCHUMER. No, I understand it is a Government case. Let me just make—
Judge ALITO. There’s more to it than the Senator— Senator SCHUMER. I am going to let you answer it. I just want to make the point here so everybody can—the majority in Smith v. Horn to say—this time it was the Government that failed to raise the issue in the district court brief. This time you were prepared to excuse that failure. This time you felt it was appropriate to consider the issue on your own, and I am at a loss to understand the difference. I am going to give you a chance to explain, but I want to read what the majority in Smith v. Horn had to say about your indulgence of the Government for failing to bring up an issue, just as the retarded person did with Pirolli. They said, ‘‘Where the State has never raised the issue at all in any court, raising the issue ourselves puts us in the untenable position of ferreting out possible defenses upon which the State has never sought to rely. When we do so, we come dangerously close to acting as advocates for the State, rather than as impartial magistrates.’’ So as far as I can see, the legal principle and procedural rule in each case was precisely the same, the only difference being that the first was a sexual harassment plaintiff who left out an argument, and in the second, it was the Government who did. In the first case you said to that retarded individual, ‘‘Sorry, you’re out of luck.’’ In the second case you said to the Government, ‘‘I’ll make your argument for you.’’ and that does not seem evenhanded to me. Can you explain the difference? Judge ALITO. Yes, Senator. As I was attempting to explain a couple minutes ago, there is an important principle called the Principle of Comity that is involved in habeas cases, and it goes to a critical part of our concept of federalism, and it is something that Congress itself has very strongly recognized in the habeas corpus statute. What I’m talking about there is the doctrine of procedural default, which is very closely related to the doctrine of exhaustion. They go hand in hand. And what Congress has said in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 is that on the issue of exhaustion, the court has to consider that even if the parties don’t raise it. Senator SCHUMER. Now, that applies to the Government as well as to the defendant? Judge ALITO. Absolutely. The issue of exhaustion must be considered by the Federal habeas court, even if the State prosecutor does not raise the issue of exhaustion. And why did Congress say that? Congress said that because there’s something more involved here than a dispute between the State prosecutor and the habeas petitioner. There is respect for the Federal system of Government involved. There is respect for the State court system involved. Senator SCHUMER. But the majority did not agree with you in that situation, did they?

625
Judge ALITO. The majority, but what I’m saying, Senator, is that the underlying principle of comity makes this case makes Smith v. Horn quite different from a dispute between private parties.
And the Supreme Court has said that it is appropriate in certain circumstances for a court to consider procedural default sua sponte, and that’s what I thought we should do there. And my position on—
Senator SCHUMER. Let me ask you—I understand your explanation. I am not sure I agree with it, but let me go on to another one. This is Dillinger. In this case it was with a corporation. The case is Dillinger v. Caterpillar. And it is also a case where a party did not raise an issue at trial, will not have the same explanation as the habeas case, obviously. They did not raise the issue at trial or on appeal. This time a large company didn’t, Caterpillar. And the majority held that it was waived and it sided with the plaintiff, who was seriously injured in the accident, right?
Judge ALITO. I don’t have a recollection of all of the facts— Senator SCHUMER. OK. Well, let me tell you. Maybe this will refresh your recollection. The majority wrote that it was not appropriate to exercise its discretion—again, it was the majority—to excuse the defendant company’s waiver when the consequence of the decision would be to deprive a seriously injured plaintiff of a trial in conformity with applicable law. That is the majority. You dissented, with the result, had you prevailed, that the accident victim’s case would have been over. The majority described your approach as follows. Quote, ‘‘There is an insurmountable procedural difficulty with Judge Alito’s position. Caterpillar never advanced this argument at trial, an oversight that Judge Alito excuses on a ground that a district court decision may be affirmed on an alternative ground, though not advanced at trial.’’ So in the Dillinger case, you also thought it was appropriate to use your discretion to excuse Caterpillar, isn’t that right? Judge ALITO. Well, I’d have to refresh my recollection about exactly what was involved in the case. There is— Senator SCHUMER. Can you explain the difference between the two for us, why in one case it was OK and why in another case it wasn’t? Judge ALITO. Senator, I’d have to refresh my recollection about Dillinger— Senator SCHUMER. So you don’t— Judge ALITO.—but what you’ve just mentioned calls—relates to the principle that it is appropriate for an appellate court to affirm a decision of a lower court on an alternative ground when the basis for that is apparent from the record of the case. So if the facts that are—if it’s a purely legal issue, for example, and you’re talking about whether you’re going to affirm or whether you’re going to reverse— Senator SCHUMER. Was that the case in Dillinger? Judge ALITO. Without refreshing my recollection, I wouldn’t be able to tell you— Senator SCHUMER. All right. Judge ALITO. But what you read— Senator SCHUMER. I would posit to you that, again, it was an example of your seeming to have more sympathy for a certain type

of plaintiff than another, but what I would like to do, Mr. Chairman, is just ask permission that Judge Alito could respond to the difference, which he hasn’t been able to do here because he doesn’t recall the details of the case, in writing in the next few days.
Chairman SPECTER. Is that acceptable to you, Judge Alito? Judge ALITO. Certainly, Senator, yes. Senator SCHUMER. Because he can then go look at the case and explain to us why he thought it was different. Chairman SPECTER. With Judge Alito’s agreement, that will be the procedure. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. Next, strict construction. President Bush has stated his beliefs that judges should be strict constructionists, rigidly adhere to the letter of the Constitution. He has described you as a strict constructionist who favors judicial restraint. So I would just like to explore one particular issue with you. First, as you said before, there are certain very straightforward questions that are easy to interpret. It says in Article I, Section 3, no person shall be a Senator who will not have attained the age of 30 years. That was a section you mentioned at our individual meeting, and there is no way that it could be constitutional, I suppose, for a 27-year-old to become a Senator, correct? That is easy. That is strict construction, easy. Judge ALITO. I can’t think of a reason why that would not be the case. Senator SCHUMER. Good. Me, either, lucky for them. [Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. Next, another one. No person except a natural-born citizen or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this Constitution shall be eligible to the office of President. So there is no way, without a constitutional amendment, that, say—I know Senator Hatch has a bill—that, say, Arnold Schwarzenegger could become President under the current circumstances. That is easy. Judge ALITO. Well, I don’t want to express a view about the constitutionality of Senator Hatch’s bill. Senator SCHUMER. No, it is a constitutional amendment. Judge ALITO. A constitutional amendment. Senator SCHUMER. I am just asking you very simply, you would need a— Judge ALITO. No one but a natural-born citizen can be the President of the United States. Senator SCHUMER. OK. Now I want to ask you about the 14th Amendment, which sets forth the definition of citizenship. It states, in relevant part, all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction therefore are citizens of the United States. All persons means all persons. That is pretty easy. Do you agree this is a fairly clear and straightforward provision of the Constitution? Judge ALITO. There are legal—there are active legal disputes about the meaning of that provision at this time. Senator SCHUMER. Right. But given the clear language, could Congress pass a statute, not a constitutional amendment, denying citizenship to a person born in the United States?

Judge ALITO. And I know that there are proposals to do that. I know that it is an issue that is in play. If it were to come before me, then I would have to go through the whole judicial process of decisionmaking—
Senator SCHUMER. Is there any way that you can see, just off the top of your head here, that that kind of statute would be constitutional?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, on issues that can come before me in litigation, I need to apply the same standard that previous nominees have applied, and that is no hints and no previews. And they may be—they may turn out to be easy issues. They may turn out to be hard issues. But I can’t opine on them here off the cuff. I would have to go through the process of—
Senator SCHUMER. Just make the argument. You don’t even have to tell us how you would decide. What imaginable argument could there be for a statute that Congress could deny the citizenship to those born in the United States, say, on the grounds that their parents were illegal aliens? Is there any constitutional argument that you can see off the top of your head?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I don’t want to say anything that— could I answer the question, Senator. I don’t want to say anything that anybody will characterize as an argument that I am making on one side of this question or on the other side of the question. I know that an argument is being made by people who favor this kind of legislation based on the language, under the jurisdiction of the United States, and I don’t know whether that will turn out to— I don’t know whether it will come before me. I don’t know whether, when it’s analyzed, it will turn out to be a compelling argument or a frivolous argument or something in between and I wouldn’t express an opinion on it.
Senator SCHUMER. Judge, I simply asked you to give us an interpretation of one of the most direct and clear provisions in the United States Constitution, and if you can’t give us an answer on a very, it seems to me, clear-cut question like that, I find, and I think many of us find, make it difficult to make an assessment of how to vote on your nomination because—
Judge ALITO. Senator, my answer is that it is inappropriate for a sitting judge or for a nominee to a judicial position to offer opinions on constitutional questions that are percolating at that time and may well come before that judge or that nominee. It may turn out to be a very simple question. It may turn out to be a complicated question. Without studying the question, I don’t know and I wouldn’t—and even if I had an initial impression, I wouldn’t voice it here. I would have to go through the whole judicial decisionmaking process before reaching a conclusion that I would be willing to express.
Senator SCHUMER. I want to move on now to the Commerce Clause and Rybar. As you know, after you ruled on Rybar, Gonzales v. Raich was decided and Justice Stevens wrote for the majority the following. ‘‘Our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause, as well as Congress’s assertion of authority thereunder, has evolved over time.’’ Do you agree with that statement? Has our understanding of the scope of that clause evolved over time, and is it appropriate for our understanding to evolve?

628
Judge ALITO. I think our understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause has evolved as the commercial activity of the country has developed. Commerce in the United States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution was entirely different from commerce in the United States today.
Senator SCHUMER. I think most people would agree with that, maybe—
Judge ALITO. As a matter of looking at the development of case law, certainly the case law has developed. The pre-New Deal case law was fundamentally different from the post-New Deal case law, with which I don’t have any quarrel.
Senator SCHUMER. Right. But here, I am going to read you two views on the Commerce Clause. One, Congress’s authority to enact laws necessary and proper for the regulation of interstate commerce is not limited to laws directed against economic activity that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Where Congress has the authority to enact a regulation of interstate commerce, it possesses every power needed to make that regulation effective.
Then there is another view. Under the Commerce Clause, Congress may regulate interstate commerce, not activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Those are pretty diametrical.
I am not asking for an absolute here, but which one is closer to your view of the Commerce Clause?
Judge ALITO. Well, the second view is contrary to Supreme Court precedent. It is contrary to even Lopez and Morrison, which says that Congress may regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.
Senator SCHUMER. Right, and the first actually was Justice Scalia’s concurrence in Raich, and the second, even though it may be contrary to precedent—we have talked about precedent before— was actually Justice Thomas’s dissent in Raich, so it is obviously a view that has some currency on the Court. I am glad to see you favor the first one.
Now, I asked you a question when we met. I asked you, as you know, because we talked about it, I was very troubled by your decision in Rybar as—and Mr. Chairman, I just don’t want to—could I get permission for an additional five minutes? That is all I will need.
Chairman SPECTER. Yes. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. I couldn’t be very forceful about it, but yes. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. I will take it any way you give it. [Laughter.] Senator SCHUMER. I asked you in Rybar when we had met if you would have decided the case differently after Raich, which is quite different than Rybar, and at that point you said you wanted to think about it and I told you I would ask you here. So I guess you have thought about it now. So my question is, does the recent Supreme Court decision in Raich, joined by Justice Scalia, whose opinion you said was closer to your view than the other, affect your thinking? More specifically, had Raich been decided before you got Rybar, do you think you would have decided it differently? Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I don’t recall making a promise that I would reach a definitive conclusion—

629
Senator SCHUMER. I asked you to think about it. You said you would. That is all.
Judge ALITO. And I have thought about it, but what I can say is that I certainly would have thought about Rybar differently had I had Raich available at that time. My effort in Rybar was to follow Supreme Court precedent. At the time, Lopez was the latest expression of the Supreme Court’s view of this question, and if the chronology had been different and I had the benefit of Raich, I would have taken that into account.
Senator SCHUMER. OK. Now, just one other thing on the Commerce Clause. So what you are saying is that there is a possibility—we won’t put a percentage on it—that Raich might have changed the outcome of your ruling or your dissent in Rybar?
Judge ALITO. Well, it certainly would have changed my thinking and my analysis. I would have had to take it into account.
Senator SCHUMER. We will take what we can get. Next, as a U.S. Attorney, you frequently crossed paths with State agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, and at that point, as I remember—I was a Member of Congress very active in anticrime legislation—there were all kinds of fights about whether there should be an increased Federal role in crime fighting. You must have dealt with some of those statutes. There was carjacking and trigger-lock type offenses. You must have presided over some prosecutions of local corruption based on an expansive Federal law theory. Mail fraud was being expanded at that time. These enforcement priorities tended to be conservative. I agreed with them, but they tended to be conservative priorities. So did your tenure as U.S. Attorney affect your thinking on these kinds of situations in terms of the State, the need for Federal involvement when the State can’t do it? And it brings up, and then I will let you speak about this for a minute, in the odometer Act—I can’t remember the exact name of it, but the legislation that was bill S. 475 that Senator Feinstein mentioned, you urged disapproval. But it seems to me if that legislation was disapproved, it would have been very difficult for the Federal Government to regulate odometers because cars that were transferred from one State to the other wouldn’t have the same uniform system in terms of their title, and it seems to me, at least, in this world which is becoming smaller and smaller that some of the federalism theory, that the States should have primacy in regulation, just don’t make sense. It didn’t make sense to me in your decision in Rybar, as we have discussed. Ninety percent of the guns used in crimes in New York come from out of State. There is no way New York State could stop them unless they inspected each car that came across the George Washington Bridge. Similarly, here. Without this Federal statute, there is no way the Federal Government could regulate odometers. It would be ridiculous to ask General Motors to have 50 different standards for 50 different States. And similarly as U.S. Attorney, there were areas where it was better for, particularly in our interconnected world, for the Federal Government to prevail. And yet here you were saying—you were working for the administration, but they ultimately rejected your view—that State primacy is such—you even said in this memo, after all, it is the

630
States, not the Federal Government, that are charged with protecting the health, safety, and welfare of citizens. That is a pretty broad statement. I would take it you had exceptions to it, of course—Medicare, U.S. Attorneys. You wouldn’t have had a job if that was an absolute statement back then.
But just tell us a little bit, for a couple of minutes, about your view of the balance between State and Federal powers, particularly in light of the changing circumstances we face.
Judge ALITO. Well, I think your mentioning those two things, the memo that I wrote when I was in OLC or that I signed when I was in OLC and my service as U.S. Attorney brings out an important point. I was playing different roles. I had different responsibilities in those two jobs. When I was in OLC, I think what I was expressing in that memo was the federalism policies of the Reagan administration, which as I mentioned earlier, involved going beyond simply insisting on compliance with constitutional standards. It also involved implementing a policy that certain things should be done at the State and local level, even if the Federal Government could do that.
As U.S. Attorney, it was my job to use the legal resources that were available to address the crime problems of the district for which I was U.S. Attorney and I approached that on a basis of cooperating with State and local law enforcement and my approach was that we should do, the Federal prosecutors should do and the Federal investigative agencies should do the things that they were best suited to do and that it should be a practical division of responsibility. And in many instances as U.S. Attorney, we were using far-reaching Federal powers. We brought a Hobbs Act prosecution and were stunned when the district court initially threw it out on Commerce Clause grounds, because that was virtually unheard of.
Senator SCHUMER. All I am trying to get at here, there is a practical dimension here that I think fits within the Constitution, and you are agreeing with that.
Judge ALITO. Absolutely, and I— Senator SCHUMER. I just have to conclude, but go ahead. Judge ALITO. Senator, that is fine. Senator SCHUMER. Good. Quit while we are ahead on that one. Let me just, in conclusion, Judge, thank you. It has been a long 3 days, obviously. As your testimony in these hearings comes to a close, I just have to tell you that I remain very troubled, not by anything in your personal history so much as by your judicial views. You arrived before us this week with a record. It is a record that contains evidence that you believe the Constitution does not protect a woman’s right to choose. It is a record that suggests you believe in an executive branch so powerful that it would trump other branches of government. It is a record that makes you appear all too willing to curtail the ability of Congress to look out for the little guy and a record in which you all too often seem to reach for the legal theory that allows you to side with the large and powerful when average Americans touched by this crushing hand of fate need the most help.

Unfortunately, by refusing to confront our questions directly and by giving us responses that really don’t illuminate how you really think as opposed to real answers, many of us have no choice but to conclude that you still embrace those views, completely or in large part, and would continue in a similar fashion on the Supreme Court. So while the process is not yet over, we have written questions, we have some witnesses, the evidence before us makes it very hard to vote yes on your nomination.
On the first day of hearings, I said that while you give the appearance of being a meticulous legal navigator, in the end, you almost always choose the rightward course. I am sorry to say that I haven’t heard anything this week very substantive to dissuade me from that opinion, but I thank you for being here and going through these hearings.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Schumer. Senator Sessions, do you have any questions? Senator SESSIONS. Just a few. I would just respond to Senator Schumer and Senator Kennedy and would note that that is not what the ABA has concluded. They have interviewed 300 of your colleagues, judges and lawyers who have practiced before you and against you, and they rate you the highest possible rating. They don’t see you as an extremist, out of the mainstream, or otherwise. And I also want to thank your family for their patience in going through all of this and listening to those of us on this side as we expostulate on all sorts of things. I see your sister back there, in her own right a nationally known attorney, Rosemary. It is good to see you here. I understand you were debate partners in high school. It must have been an interesting household to have two prominent lawyers growing up, so I will ask you how that was and who was the best debater. [Laughter.] Judge ALITO. I will take the Fifth Amendment on the second part of the question— [Laughter.] Judge ALITO.—but it structured our arguments, so instead of arguing about things at home, we would argue about the issues that we were debating. My wife insists that we actually argued a debate in front of her class. We didn’t know each other at all at the time and didn’t meet, actually, for many, many years later, but we did have a debate at her high school, which was about 20 miles away, and she insists she remembers seeing us debating in front of her French class. Senator SESSIONS. It must have been an interesting thing. Apparently, your colleagues in school there were impressed. They predicted you would serve on the Supreme Court one day, and I think that is going to turn out to be a good prediction. I would point out, Judge Alito, that you have been asked a lot about separation of powers, FISA Act, and those kind of things. This Congress has not clarified its position yet. As a judge, if some of these issues were to come before you involving congressional power or something, you would expect the Congress to have formulated its position first, would you not?

632
Judge ALITO. Well, that would certainly be very helpful. These are very—these are momentous issues and they’re difficult issues and they are—they have just come to the surface in the last few weeks and I couldn’t begin to say how I would decide any of these issues without going through the whole judicial decisionmaking process. I think it would be the height of irresponsibility for me to try to do that.
Senator SESSIONS. I would agree, and the Chairman is going to be having hearings within a few weeks here to discuss many of these issues and it is something that every Senator will be engaged in, whether they desire to or not, and we will have to think these important issues through. I don’t think they are ripe yet for decision, that is for sure.
I would also note that with regard to Justice Jackson’s position on the President and his war making powers and the question of when there is a higher position and a lower ebb position, Chief Justice Rehnquist discussed that idea in Dames and Moore v. Reagan and, in fact, pointed out that that doesn’t completely answer the question. Those answers are not black and white and there is a spectrum running from explicit congressional authorization to implicit or to explicit congressional prohibition. So there are many factors that must be considered, would you not agree, as you analyze those matters?
Judge ALITO. Yes, you have to know the specifics of the situation. Senator SESSIONS. On the question of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and whether Congress has the power to contain it in some way, it does appear there is language in the Constitution that indicates that. As you said yesterday, it is there. My question to you is do you believe that the three branches of Government owe it to our country and to our constituents to stay within our bounds and to avoid a constitutional confrontation, a constitutional crisis? Isn’t it better if the courts restrain themselves, Congress would restrain itself and not to go forward to an ultimate confrontation of those issues? Judge ALITO. It certainly is. The issue of the ability of Congress to take away the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction over a particular subject of cases is not something that I have previously addressed in writings, unlike a lot of previous nominees who had addressed that, and therefore I think felt that they were freer to discuss that when they came before the Committee. That is not something that I have ever addressed in any writing, nor is it something that I have studied, other than to read a few— you know, read some of the authorities who have addressed the question. I did mention that I had given a speech expressing the idea that I thought that it was not a good policy idea. I could understand the—I understand the motivation, but I don’t think that it is good as a matter of policy to proceed in that fashion. And I don’t know what the argument would be as I sit here in favor of taking away jurisdiction over an entire class of cases. That would raise some serious constitutional questions. Senator SESSIONS. I would just say to you I think we ought not to confront that question if we can avoid it, and that is why I have not joined in legislation, some of which has been filed in this Congress, to take jurisdiction away. But I do believe that is some

633
power that has been given to the Congress and hopefully will not have to be utilized. Hopefully, that sword will never be drawn because the Court will show restraint and remain within the constitutional powers that they have.
With regard to the unitary Executive, there are just three branches of Government in our Constitution. That is correct, is it not?
Judge ALITO. That is all I see in it. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. Well, does every agency and department have to be within one or the other? Judge ALITO. I think they do. That doesn’t say that they can’t be structured in ways that differ from each other, depending on their function. And that doesn’t address the separate issues of appointment or removal or whether—well, let me just leave it there, with appointment and removal. But I think that the Constitution sets up three branches and everything has to be within one of those branches. Senator SESSIONS. One of the things that I learned as United States Attorney is these agencies think they are independent entities. They think they are almost like nations. When they get together—you probably had this experience—they sign memorandums of understanding. Wouldn’t you agree they sometimes look awfully like treaties? Judge ALITO. They do look—yes, they do look like treaties between Federal law enforcement agencies and State law enforcement agencies. Senator SESSIONS. But, of course, the Federal Government is one. They can’t take two positions in a lawsuit. That is for certain. With regard to interstate commerce, there is a limit to that, to the power of the Government, I believe. In the Hobbs Act and the Racketeering Act that Senator Schumer mentioned, doesn’t it say within those Acts that the extortion of the pattern of racketeering has to affect interstate commerce and that is an element that the prosecutor must prove before a conviction can be obtained? Judge ALITO. Yes, that is right, and the Federal criminal statutes that I am familiar with almost without exception have jurisdictional elements in them. That is the traditional way of casting them. There are a few areas where that is not feasible, such as drugs, but in most of the—most of the statutes have jurisdictional elements right in them. Senator SESSIONS. And that is basically the Lopez holding, was it not? And in your opinion in Rybar, you specifically said all that Congress needed to do was to put in an interstate commerce nexus that would be proved to the jury, which I agree with you; having prosecuted hundreds of drug cases, it has not ever been a problem in those cases to prove. That would have solved the problem, isn’t that correct? Judge ALITO. That is right. In firearms cases, that is just not a problem. Senator SESSIONS. Well, I think you have testified extremely well here. You have been most forthcoming. I disagree with the recent comment that you haven’t been forthcoming. I would say—and I think Senator Biden indicated that we have not had a witness

more forthcoming, more willing to discuss the issues than you have.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. I thought we were going to get to that light at the end of the tunnel before one. It looks like we are going to be a little later than that, but we don’t want to take a break now. So to the extent we could move ahead rapidly, it would be appreciated. Senator Durbin, you had originally asked for ten minutes, but I understand you want more time. How much would you like? Senator DURBIN. Senator, I will do it as close to ten minutes as I can. I might need a few extra. I want to reach the end of that same tunnel. Chairman SPECTER. All right. Let’s set the clock at ten, with flexibility to exceed that. Senator DURBIN. Thank you very much. Thank you, Judge Alito. Thanks to your family for putting up with this endurance test, and I appreciate your patience throughout. First, let me address the issue of court-stripping that was mentioned by my friend from the State of Alabama. I really hope that Congress will never draw that sword. We heard about it during the Schiavo case. If we are going to have a truly independent judiciary, the thought that Congress will take away from the courts issues which we disagree with would really jeopardize it. And just editorializing, I hope we don’t reach that point. After you leave today, there will be a panel of your colleagues on the bench from the Third Circuit. Was this your idea that they come and testify? Judge ALITO. No, it was not. Senator DURBIN. Were you asked if it was a good idea? Judge ALITO. No, I was not. Senator DURBIN. OK. I understand it has never happened before and that is why I asked you that question. I don’t know who came up with this notion, but it does raise some interesting questions which we have shared on a bipartisan basis about that testimony. But since you weren’t involved in that decisionmaking, I will drop it at that. Then there will come some public witnesses and one of those witnesses will raise a contrast between two decisions you made, and I am going to give you a chance now to respond to that charge or that observation that will be made. Fourth Amendment cases. One we have talked about a lot, Doe v. Groody, another we have talked about, I think, tangentially which involves Leveto. I hope I am pronouncing that correctly. Judge ALITO. Leveto, or I am not sure what the pronunciation is, yes. Senator DURBIN. You know which case I am concerned with? Judge ALITO. Yes, I do. Senator DURBIN. In the Leveto case, a veterinarian and his wife, subject to Internal Revenue Service agents coming at 6:30 in the morning, detaining him, patting him down in an Internal Revenue Service investigation, holding him for 6 hours in his office. Then they went to his home, found his wife in her nightgown, patted her

635
down, held her incommunicado for a period of time. And they brought a civil suit and said the Government went too far; they didn’t have the authority to do those things, to pat us down and search.
And your conclusion, writing the majority opinion, was, yes, they did go too far. There was a question about immunity which I won’t touch on, but at least from the Fourth Amendment point of view you said that the Government went too far.
Now, of course, the notorious case that has come up time and again of Doe v. Groody. In that case, there is a search of premises and a John Doe search warrant looking for someone who might have been involved in drug-dealing. An affidavit attached to the warrant says that it could also involve persons on the premises who may be hiding drugs, but the affidavit is not part of the search warrant. It is maybe incorporated in general terms. The majority of the court says that it was not incorporated, Judge Chertoff writing for the majority. Particularly egregious is the fact that a mother and her 10-year-old daughter were strip-searched pursuant to that search warrant. And in that case, you concluded that that was warranted, that was an acceptable search.
So the witness who comes before us is going to say, Judge, how can you do this? You have a veterinarian here and his wife, an IRS search. In their case, you said they went too far when they patted them down and searched them. The next case involving a 10-yearold girl in a strip search—you say they didn’t go too far.
How would you compare the two and draw the distinction between them?
Judge ALITO. Well, the Leveto case involved the issue of how long they could detain people who were present on the premises while they executed the search of the premises. And they detailed these people for a very long period. I don’t remember—
Senator DURBIN. Six hours, or more. Judge ALITO. It might even have been longer. It was a very long period of time and there was no warrant for their arrest. There was no claim that there was a justification to seize them, other than the fact that they were present on the premises at the time when the search was being executed. The Doe v. Groody case involved the question of the interpretation of the warrant, and the standard that is to be applied there is, the Supreme Court has told us, a practical, common-sense instruction. It is not—the warrant is not to be interpreted like a sophisticated commercial instrument that is drafted by parties. The facts were—you mentioned many of them—that the affidavit prepared by the police officer said we have probable cause to search anybody who is found on the premises because we know that—we have probable cause to believe that this drug dealer will hide drugs on the people on the premises. And they presented that to the magistrate and the magistrate issued the warrant, attached the affidavit to the warrant and said the warrant is incorporated for—and I guess I left out the important fact that the officers—they said we have probable cause to search anybody on the premises and that is what we want; we want authorization to search anybody on the premises.

636
And the magistrate granted the warrant and attached the affidavit to the warrant, and said the affidavit is incorporated for the purpose of probable cause, which meant that the magistrate found that there was probable cause to search anybody on the premises. But in the portion of the warrant where it said person to be searched, it only mentioned this—
Senator DURBIN. John Doe. Judge ALITO. The John Doe, and using—now if this were a bond, I think you would conclude the only person you can search is John Doe. But it is a warrant, and my view was that viewing this from a practical standpoint, when the magistrate says, yes, you are right, there is probable cause to search anybody on the premises, that is what he is saying. Those are the people he is saying can be searched. But even if one didn’t agree with that, you would go on to the qualified immunity question and say could a reasonable police officer who says I have got probable cause to search anybody who is on the premises and that is what I want, and you go to the magistrate and he magistrate says I agree with you on probable cause and here is your warrant—could they reasonably think that the magistrate is saying, yes, search anybody on the premises? Senator DURBIN. So did it go into your thinking, this whole question of the dignity of the individual, that we are, in fact, dealing with a mother and a 10-year-old daughter who were subjected to the most intrusive search? Was that part of your thinking in terms of coming down in the minority position and saying it was all right to go ahead with the search? Did you consider that calculation? Judge ALITO. I was concerned about the fact that a minor had been searched. And I mentioned that in my opinion and that is something that is very unfortunate. But the issue in the case was not whether there is some sort of rule that minors can’t be searched. That is not part of Fourth Amendment law, as I understand it, and there would be a very bad consequence if that were the rule because where would drug dealers hide their drugs? Minors would then become—they would become the repository of the drugs and the firearms. Senator DURBIN. Or the issuing authority may be more specific in the warrant which, as I understand it, is what the Fourth Amendment is all about. Judge ALITO. Well, the warrant here certainly could have been drafted better, and a lot of— Senator DURBIN. I think that is what the majority said. Judge ALITO. It is, but we have to take into account that these are police officers operating under time pressure. And the Supreme Court has told us that we are not to read these warrants like they are complicated commercial documents. We are trying to get at the practicalities of the situation. Senator DURBIN. I only have a few minutes and I will try my best to end it, but I don’t think I can do it in two. In the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, Judge Richard Posner is a very prolific writer about many things. He recently made an observation which I think really is a challenge to all of us on the Judiciary Committee. We currently have a situation involving immigra-

tion cases, particularly those involving asylum and deportation, that we have to look at very seriously.
There was an effort to clear the backlog when Attorney General Ashcroft was in charge, and some procedures were changed to streamline the process. And a lot of these cases were just churned out very quickly, with very little evidence as to why decisions were being made. Judge Posner made that point recently, publicly stating, if I might quote him, ‘‘The adjudication of these cases at the administrative level has fallen below the minimum standards of legal justice.’’ he said.
Now, you have been involved in some of these cases, about nine split decisions, as we calculate here. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of these cases coming to the Federal appeals courts. In one particular case here, the Saidou Dia case, which involved the deportation of a man back to Guinea, where he refused to serve in the military. His wife was then confronted in his home country at their home. When they couldn’t find him, they beat her, raped her, and burned down his home. And this was a man who said, ‘‘I don’t want to go back because I think it could be a dangerous circumstance for me.’’
In this case, you dissented and said, ‘‘Return him to Guinea.’’ You didn’t feel that there was a strong enough case to grant him asylum in the United States and to stay.
The reason I raise it is we looked at your record in cases where there was a split decision, and we discovered that you ruled for the Government in eight out of nine cases and in seven of those eight cases yours was the minority position.
So my question to you is: Do you appreciate the observation made by Judge Posner about the terrible state of affairs when it comes to the immigration judges and the decisions they are sending for you to review? And why did you in those contested cases consistently rule on the Government side?
Judge ALITO. Well, Senator, I think I have ruled in favor of asylum seekers in a number of cases now and—
Senator DURBIN. There are usually no dissents in those cases. Judge ALITO. Well, I know that I’ve ruled in favor of asylum seekers in quite a number of cases. I don’t have the list on the tip of my tongue. In the Dia case that you mentioned, the facts that you recited were not the facts that were found by the immigration judge. Those were the facts that the asylum seeker alleged, and the whole issue in the case was whether there was sufficient evidence to support the contrary finding of the immigration judge. I agree with Judge Posner that the way these cases are handled leaves an enormous amount to be desired. I have been troubled by this; my court has been troubled by this. But my situation as a court of appeals judge before whom these cases come is created by the legal framework that Congress has created. And Congress has given us a very limited role in reviewing factual findings by immigration judges. What Congress has said is that we have to accept factual findings by the immigration judge unless no reasonable fact finder could come to a contrary conclusion. And that’s a tough standard.

638
And I have tried to adhere faithfully to that standard in all the cases that come before me, even if I felt that I might have reached a different conclusion on the record.
Senator DURBIN. Judge, wouldn’t you concede there are basically two standards that are being debated here? One is that no reasonable adjudicator would have come to a different conclusion. The other talks about substantial evidence. And you have followed that second standard, the substantial evidence case in Liu v. Ashcroft and Zhang v. Gonzales.
My point I want to get to—and this will be the last thing I ask you—is if we know the system is broken, if we know that it doesn’t give basic fairness and justice, do you not feel at your level that you have to be more sensitive to the fact that there are people’s lives at stake here and that you have to take care when they are asking for asylum and protection in the United States not to let this broken system work to their detriment?
Judge ALITO. We do have to keep in mind just what’s at stake, and I do that. I know that a lot is at stake in these cases, and I read the record to see if there is support for the arguments that are made by these petitioners. But I have no way of supplementing the record. And there are serious problems. One of the most serious problems, I think, is that the witnesses, the asylum seekers generally testify in another language. Sometimes it’s a language that is not well represented in the population of the United States, so it may be difficult to get a translator. And the quality of the transcripts is often very poor, which makes it very difficult to understand what was going on before the immigration judge.
Now, there have been cases where we’ve said the transcript here is so bad that we can’t make a decision on this, and we will send it back.
But there’s the additional problem that the immigration judges are forced to make credibility determinations based on viewing someone who comes from a different culture, where mannerisms, gestures, facial expressions may mean something different than they do in our culture, and I’m aware of that. But these are bigger problems. These are problems for Congress to address. They’re not problems that I can address in the context of deciding these particular cases.
Senator DURBIN. Thank you. I agree, and I thank you very much. And I finished in under 15 minutes, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, thank you very much, Senator Durbin. That is appreciated.
Senator Graham? No comments. Wonderful. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Cornyn? Senator Cornyn? Senator CORNYN. I yield back my time. Chairman SPECTER. Doubly wonderful. We are going to be going into executive session when we finish, which will be just in a few moments, and we have attempted to notify all Senators, those not here, through staff. The purpose is to discuss in private any questions which arise as to—any questions anybody may have in mind as to Judge Alito. It doesn’t suggest anything of substance, but we have adopted this practice since Justice Breyer’s proceeding and do it as a matter of routine so that if

there is something, by going into executive session we do not signal that there is something. And going into executive session does not mean, if there is something, that there is nothing, but it is routine. As I explained it, I am not quite sure why we do it, but we do it.
[Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. It doesn’t take long if you do it before lunch. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. There has been some suggestion we do it after lunch, and let me tell you, it would be a long session. But we are going to do it before lunch, and we are going to do it in the Committee hearing room, which has been swept—another unnecessary item because there is nothing to say in there. But that is our procedure. Now I yield to our distinguished Ranking Member, Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Thank you. Just briefly, Mr. Chairman, and you have been so courteous on this, I hate to even take this time. But in saying this, I want to make sure Judge Alito is here. When we started this, I actually started with the same subject I started with then-Judge Roberts, now Chief Justice. It is on the question of Presidential power, and whether he appreciates the role of the Supreme Court as a check and balance. As you know, I voted for him, and that is a leap of faith because nobody makes commitments on exactly how they are going to vote in one case or another. In this case, it has been pointed out you are to replace Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. Actually, initially Chief Justice Roberts was nominated for that. Then Harriet Miers was nominated. The President was forced by concerns within his own party to withdraw her, then nominated you very quickly after you had been—well, you had been interviewed once at the beginning of his term, but then you were interviewed again by Vice President Cheney and Karl Rove, Scooter Libby, I think a few others. And that is why I worry. I just wanted to make sure in my own mind that you would stand as a check and balance, for this President or any President. I know your concerns you expressed in the year 2000. You criticized the independent counsel law. So many times in the questions I have raised this issue, because I was afraid you would not act as a check and balance. We have a Government that is getting more and more powerful, in the electronic age especially powerful. We see illegal spying on Americans by Americans. All of us agree the President is not above the law any more than you are or I am. But it takes more than that, especially if we are giving the President the power unilaterally to redefine the law, an issue that is going eventually to come before you. So those are my concerns. I wanted you to know what my concerns are. They go beyond the other issues raised by Senator Specter or other Senators, though those are legitimate issues. But those are mine, and I wanted to say that to you personally. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. We were about to excuse you from any further participation in these proceedings, Judge Alito. I have been handed statistics which show that you have been questioned for about 18 hours, the number of questions approximating some 700, and some differences of

opinion as to the comprehensiveness of your responses. But Senators are entitled to their own views, and you will be hearing more when we conclude the hearings and later go into executive session for the Committee to vote and further on floor debate. But you have certainly demonstrated remarkable patience—I think everybody would agree with that—and remarkable stamina and a very loyal family, led by your wife. And we thank you for your public service, and you may be assured that the Committee on both sides and all of the balance of our 100 Senators will give very, very careful consideration to the President’s nomination of you for the Supreme Court.
We will recess now and we will resume at—it is uncertain how long our session will be, so we will resume at 2:30 and we will begin with a report from the American Bar Association, and then we will move to witnesses from the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Senator LEAHY. Right now we are going to the closed— Chairman SPECTER. But now we are going to the Committee hearing room, Dirksen 226, for an executive session. [Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the Committee was recessed, to reconvene at 2:30 p.m., this same day.] Chairman SPECTER. The Judiciary Committee will now proceed with the confirmation hearing on Judge Samuel Alito for the Supreme Court of the United States. After our morning session, the Committee met in executive session and reviewed confidential data on the background of Judge Alito, and it was all found to be in order. We are now proceeding with the witnesses. The tradition of the outside witnesses, the independent witnesses, our tradition is to hear first from the American Bar Association and their evaluation of the judicial nominee. We have structured this portion of our hearing differently from what had been done prior to last year, and that is, where the majority took most of the outside witnesses. The tradition has been to have 30 witnesses, and the majority party had taken 18, and the minority party 12, and it seemed that it would be more appropriate to have an even split, 15 and 15, and that is the practice we are following. And of course, the ABA representatives are not witnesses called by either Democrats or Republicans. We have really done our best to proceed in a nonpolitical way in the selection of a Supreme Court Justice. There can be different evaluations as to how successful we are in that, but that has been our effort. We have limited testimony to 5 minutes for outside witnesses. The next witness already nods in agreement. He was here not too long ago for Chief Justice Roberts. And we have established the 5minute rule because we have 31 witnesses, and the Senate is not in session, and all the members of the Committee have other commitments. It is projected that we will finish today, but we will have to keep on schedule. We turn now to the American Bar Association panel, and we welcome Mr. Steve Tober, Ms. Marna Tucker, and Mr. John Payton. In accordance with the practice, the testimony will be given by Mr. Tober, who is the Chairman of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. He is an attorney

with a law firm bearing his name, experienced in civil litigation, professional negligence and domestic relations; undergraduate and law degree from Syracuse University; on the board of the Law Review; deeply involved in New Hampshire and New England legal communities, former chairman of the Committee to Redraft New Hampshire’s Rule on Professional Conduct.
We know the laborious job involved, Mr. Tober, which you are about to describe, in reaching an evaluation of a Supreme Court nominee, and the importance of your judgment, so we thank you and Mr. Payton and Ms. Tucker for your public service.
Now, Mr. Tober, the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF STEPHEN L. TOBER, ESQ., CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, PORTSMOUTH, NEW HAMPSHIRE; ACCOMPANIED BY MARNA TUCKER, ESQ., D.C. CIRCUIT REPRESENTATIVE, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, WASHINGTON, D.C.; AND JOHN PAYTON, ESQ., FEDERAL CIRCUIT REPRESENTATIVE, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. TOBER. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee. My name is Stephen L. Tober of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and it is my privilege to chair the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.
I am indeed joined today by Marna Tucker, our D.C. Circuit Representative, and by John Payton, our Federal Circuit Representative.
For well over 50 years the ABA Standing Committee has provided a unique and comprehensive examination of the professional qualifications of candidates for the Federal bench. It is composed of 15 distinguished lawyers who represent every judicial circuit in the United States, and who annually volunteer hundreds of hours of public service.
Our committee conducts a thorough, nonpartisan, nonideological peer review, using well-established standards that measure a nominee’s integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.
With respect to a nomination to the United States Supreme Court, the Standing Committee’s investigation is based upon the premise that such a nominee must possess exceptional professional qualifications. The significance, range and complexity of issues that will be confronted on that Court demands no less. As such, our investigation of a Supreme Court nominee is more extensive and is procedurally different from others in two principal ways.
First, all circuit members on the Standing Committee reach out to a wide range of individuals within their respective circuits who are most likely to have information regarding the nominee’s professional qualifications. And second, reading groups of scholars and distinguished practitioners are formed to review the nominee’s legal writings and advise the Standing Committee. The reading groups assist in evaluating the nominee’s analytical skills, knowledge of the law, application of the facts to the law, and the ability to communicate effectively.

In the case of Judge Alito, circuit members combined to contact well over 2,000 individuals throughout this Nation. Those contacts cut across virtually every demographic consideration, and it included judges, lawyers and members of the general community. Thereafter, circuit members interviewed more than 300 people who knew, had worked with, or had substantial knowledge of the nominee. All interviews regarding the nominee were fully confidential to assure the most candid of assessments.
Judge Alito has created a substantial written record over his years of public service. Our three reading groups worked collaboratively to read and evaluate nearly 350 of his published opinions, several dozen of his unpublished opinions, a number of his Supreme Court oral argument transcripts and corresponding briefs, and other articles and legal memos.
The academic reading groups were composed of distinguished faculty from the Syracuse University College of Law and from the Georgetown University Law Center. The practitioners group was composed of nationally recognized lawyers intimately familiar with demands of appellate practice at the highest level.
Finally, as we do in any Standing Committee investigation, a personal interview was conducted with this nominee. Judge Alito met with the three of us on December 12th, and he provided us a full opportunity to review matters with him in detail.
After the comprehensive investigation was completed, the findings were assembled into a detailed confidential report. Each member of the Standing Committee reviewed that final report thoroughly, and individually evaluated that nominee using three rating categories: well qualified, qualified and not qualified. Needless to say, to merit an evaluation of well qualified, the nominee must possess professional qualifications and achievements of the highest standing.
During our investigation questions were raised concerning the nominee’s recusal practice, and also concerning some aspects of his judicial temperament. We have carefully reviewed and resolved those questions to our satisfaction, as we have detailed in our accompanying correspondence to your Committee, which, Mr. Chairman, we ask to be made part of this record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made part of the record.
Mr. TOBER. We are ultimately persuaded that Judge Alito has, throughout his 15 years on the Federal bench, established a record of both proper judicial conduct and evenhanded application in seeking to do what is fundamentally fair.
As such, on the basis of its comprehensive investigation, and with one recusal, the Standing Committee unanimously concluded that Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. is well qualified to serve as Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. His integrity, his professional competence and his judicial temperament are indeed found to be of the highest standard.
Mr. Chairman, let me say once again what we noted here back in September. The goal of the ABA Standing Committee has always been and remains in concert with the goal of your Committee, to assure a qualified and independent judiciary for the American

people. With that, thank you for the opportunity to present these remarks.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Tober appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Tober, for your work and for ending right on the button, 5 minutes to a tee.
Mr. TOBER. I worked on that, sir. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. That quality of yours would recommend you for Supreme Court argument, where Chief Justice Rehnquist stopped the speaker in mid-sentence, and the word from Judge Becker, who will testify later, he was looking for an opportunity— he stopped me in mid-sentence one day—and he was looking for an opportunity to stop a speaker in the middle of the word ‘‘if,’’ I did not give him that chance. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Before proceeding to questions, I want to yield to Senator Leahy, to see if he has any opening comments that he wants to make. Senator LEAHY. I do not, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, though. Chairman SPECTER. We have 5-minute rounds for each of the members of the Committee. Mr. Tober, picking up on your testimony that you found Judge Alito to have evenhanded application of the law, how would you amplify that with respect to what kind of materials you have looked at, and what your evaluation was, and what led you to that conclusion? Mr. TOBER. Be happy to, Mr. Chairman. The conclusion was reached in large measure in interviews with, as I said, well over 300 individuals around this country, over 130 of whom were Federal judges. Many were State judges. Many were colleagues, cocounsel, opposing counsel, who almost uniformly talked in terms of his even-handedness, of his open-mindedness, of his willingness to be fair. He is called ‘‘a judge’s judge’’ more than once in those interviews. When we interviewed him we had questions that would have been on that issue, and we discussed that issue with him to get his own personal perspective on it, and we were satisfied with what we heard at that time. And perhaps it’s best reflected in his writings, which again, I indicated the body of that work was read by our three reading groups collaboratively, and the conclusion that was reached, if you will, the overarching conclusion that was reached, is that this is a judge who brings pragmatic skills to his decisionmaking. We discussed that with him in that interview that we had on December 12th. He tried to do what he thinks is right with respect to the application of the law that is before him. He took us through how he analyzes that approach, up to the point that when he is just about ready to release his decision, he looks back once again at the law to make sure he has not misapprehended something in the first instance, and second, to make sure that the outcome is fair. That to me suggests— Chairman SPECTER. You say he came back to you twice? Mr. TOBER. I am sorry?

Chairman SPECTER. Was your testimony that he came back to you? What did you mean when he came back and took another look.
Mr. TOBER. He would look at his draft opinion, Mr. Chairman, before it would be issued, and he would look back at the law that he was applying in that opinion and the outcome that was occurring in that opinion, just to justify in his mind one more time that the outcome would be fair.
Chairman SPECTER. Did your group study all of his opinions? Mr. TOBER. The reading groups read 350 of his published opinions, scores of his unpublished opinions and other materials, yes. Chairman SPECTER. And did they make any analysis of—an issue has been raised as to whether Judge Alito unduly favored the powerful or the Government. Did your ABA analysis reach that issue? Mr. TOBER. That issue was one that we looked at, and we discussed it in our letter of evaluation, and I gave some examples of some of the disparate results that we were told about. One of the reading groups reported to us that they could not reach a full conclusion on whether or not it was some attempt to favor one outcome for a group of litigants over another. And while there were a couple of members in a couple other reading groups that may have said the same thing in so many words, there were a significant number of other individuals in the reading groups who said they couldn’t find any such evidence of that. It was inconclusive with respect to the reading groups. What was of interest in the reading group reports to us was a comment that was echoed by others, which is that in looking for a sense of partiality in the opinions, the conclusion that was left very often was one of pragmatism, that— Chairman SPECTER. Let me interrupt you, because my time is almost up, to ask you to clarify what was inconclusive in your studies. Mr. TOBER. It was inconclusive whether or not there were certain categories of parties who might have come out at the wrong end of Judge Alito’s opinions. Chairman SPECTER. Did some of those readers find that he was impartial and some find the contrary? Mr. TOBER. My understanding is it was inconclusive. We did not receive any clarion call at one point that he was representing or suggesting to have a bias against any particular group of litigants before him. Chairman SPECTER. A considerable amount of attention has been paid in these hearings to the recusal issue of Vanguard. Would you comment on what your committee found there? Mr. TOBER. I am going to defer to Mr. Payton, who took the lead on the Vanguard-related issues, if that is OK with the Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Mr. Payton? Mr. PAYTON. We certainly looked into all of the recusal issues. We asked Judge Alito in some detail about how the Vanguard and the other recusal issues came about. But let me put this in some context which I think will be helpful. In the materials that Judge Alito submitted to this Committee, he attached a list of all of the cases from which he had been recused over his 15-year tenure, and that is 40 pages long, with
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00656 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

645
about 30 to 35 cases per page. It is well over a thousand cases from which he was recused.
Among those cases that he was recused from were cases involving Vanguard in 1992, cases involving his sister’s law firm throughout the tenure, cases involving the U.S. Attorney’s Office throughout the tenure, cases involving the other entities that he had identified in his representation to this Committee back in 1990.
A few cases, in fact, slipped through, and that has been the subject of our inquiries and some of the testimony before this Committee. We asked him how that came about. He explained how he thought it came about, but I think it is fair to say he was not certain how they slipped through, whether it was through the screen, whether it was because they were pro se cases.
In the end, he did acknowledge that it was his responsibility that a mistake and error had been made, those cases should have been caught, and he should have not heard those cases. We listened quite carefully to all of that, and in the context in which we understood how this came about, we accepted his explanation that he simply had made a mistake. These cases should not have slipped through the screen, just like the other thousand or so cases were captured by the screen in the process, but they did. They shouldn’t have. And we think that did not reflect in any significant degree on his integrity.
Let me tell you something else we did that goes to both of your questions, Mr. Chairman. We also interviewed an incredibly broad array of judges—virtually all of the members of the Third Circuit, virtually all of the district judges that were in New Jersey and were in Philadelphia. We interviewed a number of the other judges in the Third Circuit who were on the district court who had contact with Judge Alito. And what we learned from them almost unanimously was that he is held in incredibly high regard with respect to the issues that this committee, the ABA’s committee, looks at: his integrity, his judicial competence, and his judicial temperament. And on the issue of the recusals, everyone—everyone— thought that he has the highest integrity and that these few cases that slipped through do not diminish his integrity.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Payton. The red light went on during the course of your testimony, so I will terminate and yield to my colleague, Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Just to followup on that, on Vanguard, the only reason I even mention this is that the initial explanation from Judge Alito and the White House after his nomination was a computer glitch had precipitated the Vanguard case. But then he answered some questions from Senator Feingold by saying that in the Monga case it wasn’t a computer glitch that caused his failure to submit Vanguard to the clerk of the court. Then he said when it came before him, he was not focused. Since your report was filed, we have learned that Judge Alito did not have Vanguard on his recusal list as far back as 1993, notwithstanding the fact that in 1990 he had given a sworn statement to the Committee that he would recuse. Some of that information came after your report. Would it change anything in the conclusion?

Mr. PAYTON. I think that it is—like I said, from the interview with him, I am not sure we figured out what caused these cases to slip through. I am not sure Judge Alito knew the precise answer to that. But he did acknowledge that it was a mistake.
On what was on his standing recusal list, I don’t know what was on his standing recusal list, but I just note in the materials that were submitted to this committee, there is a 1992 entry of an entity that has the name Vanguard in it—it is Vanguard—that says, ‘‘Recusal because on standing recusal list.’’
I don’t know what happened in 1993. I don’t know if things went on and went off. Something went wrong here, and these cases came before him, and they shouldn’t have. But they are a very small number in a huge universe of cases from which he was recused.
Mr. TOBER. Senator, may I add to that very briefly. Senator LEAHY. Sure. Mr. TOBER. We did not find in the vast number of our interviews and the review with the nominee and any other extrinsic information we could look at any pattern of intentional effort to try and have Judge Alito impose himself in cases in which he did not belong. We are persuaded that some errors were made, some mistakes were made, and they total up to a small handful. In the course of the numbers that he has been sitting on—and I believe Senator Hatch suggested yesterday some 4,000 or 5,000 cases have been adjudicated involving Judge Alito—we took that into context, particularly in light of the comments from individuals who know him and work with him, with respect to the ethics he brings to the position. Senator LEAHY. You understand the reason this became an issue here is because it was based on a sworn statement that he recuse. You also looked into his open-mindedness, his commitment to equal justice. I am just asking, in doing that—because I have never served on one of these committees that you are on. There have been a number of studies of the judge’s record—Knight-Ridder, the Washington Post, Cass Sunstein and others—and they have concluded that he had much more likelihood of siding against discrimination plaintiffs than other circuit judges. Knight-Ridder reviewed 311 of his published opinions and found that he seldom sided with a criminal defendant, a foreign national facing deportation, an employee alleging discrimination, or a consumer suing Big Business. And his record stood out significantly from others in the circuit. Did this question come in on the issue of whether he was compassionate? Mr. TOBER. The answer is yes, we looked at that. Our reading groups looked at it for us. We discussed it with the nominee in our interview on December 12th. We are not immune from the media stories that have been available. I suggest everybody on my committee has been watching the last 3 days very carefully. We are where we started with that issue, and that is, the over 300 people we spoke with who know this person as a judge, as an individual, are convinced that he has an open mind, that he does not bring any bias to his decisionmaking. Senator LEAHY. And, last, on the issue of CAP, nobody is suggesting a bias on his part, but what bothers me, when you are doing a job application in 1985—we know Judge Alito is a very

careful person, and I mean that as a compliment. On a carefully put together job application, he proudly proclaims his membership in CAP, a group that was very much dedicated to keeping minorities and women out of Princeton, one that would probably look unkindly toward either Judge Alito’s Italian ancestors or my Italian ancestors. Was this just pandering to the Meese and the Reagan administration, or was this just a total screw-up?
Mr. TOBER. May I defer to Ms. Tucker with that? Senator LEAHY. Sure. Ms. TUCKER. We looked at that question, Senator. We were very concerned about that listing, knowing that membership in that organization would put him perhaps on an extreme that we would be uncomfortable with. His answers to our committee were very similar, if not identical, to the answers to your Committee. He did not recall when he became a member or even what he did, but he didn’t recall ever attending any meetings or reading any publications. He did recall that he joined the organization because of the university’s attempt to remove ROTC— Senator LEAHY. But that is not really my question. Was there any question of why—why was he so proud of this that he would put it in a 1985 job opplication—when everybody—everybody— knew what kind of an organization it was, where Senator Bill Frist had condemned it and Senator Bill Bradley had. Did you ask why he proudly put that on his application? Ms. TUCKER. We asked him why he put that on there. We didn’t ask him why he proudly put that on there. But he stated that he recalled he was a member. We specifically asked him if this was to—since it was a job application, was he pandering, and he said it would be improper to not tell the truth on an application, that he was a member of that organization. But there were only two organization that he listed, as I recall, on that application: one was the Federalist Society, the other was the Concerned Alumni for Princeton. He did not have a long list of activities at that time. But I should say, in fairness, we were very concerned about the membership of that and what happened, and all of the people we spoke to on the courts, women and minorities, people who he had worked with, people who had sat on panels with him side by side in issuing judicial opinions, almost universally said that they saw no bigotry, no prejudice. They thought he was a fair man. And they felt that if he did put that—they were shocked when they heard that that was listed on his application. And they said, ‘‘That is not the Sam Alito we know.’’ And we heard that time and time again. Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Tober. Thank you, Ms. Tucker. Thank you, Mr. Payton. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. I will reserve my time. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. Did you know, Mr. Tober, that the Vanguard Ventron, which is the case of 1992, actually involved the carpenters? It names the carpenters which were on the Alito list for recusal, and—Mr.

Payton, maybe this should be directed to you—and that most of the people that have looked through there in detail feel that the reason that that was actually recused is because of the carpenters. I think it is spelled carpenteers—yes, c-a-r-p-e-n—carpenter, and that is the reason it was under the name of the Vanguard. You are familiar with that?
Mr. PAYTON. Yes. I simply thought that it was unclear whether or not what would have caused that to be kicked off because of the standing recusal list was any hit with Vanguard or something else. It is unclear. You cannot tell from what is there.
Senator KENNEDY. Did the committee know, when it inquired of the nominee, that Judge Alito had made a promise to the Committee under oath that he was going to recuse himself from Vanguard?
Mr. PAYTON. Yes, and we asked him about that. Senator KENNEDY. And did he indicate what—well, what was his response? Mr. PAYTON. His response was that it was a mistake for those cases to have slipped through. That was not just a question about what the code said, but also what his representation to this Committee encompassed, that it was a mistake. Senator KENNEDY. Was the mistake, as you understand it, is because he did not, for one reason or another, neglected to put the Vanguard on his recusal list? Mr. PAYTON. No, I do not think I could say it that concretely. The mistake was that it got through. Why it got through, I think it was not completely clear to us, and I am not sure it was clear to Judge Alito. It got through. Senator KENNEDY. It was not on his 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 list, and the 1993 said no changes were made from 1992. So there is just 1 year, year and a half. We do not have the record on it, and I am just wondering, in your inquiry and review of that case, since that is the principal source of, as I understand it, of revenue. I mean it has had sizable increases in the revenue from the time he took that oath till the more recent years. So that is one of the factors on it. I was just interested, when he said it was a mistake, whether you made a determination, detection, because we have not been able to find that it was ever put on. Quite frankly, at least as a member of the Committee, we have heard a number of reasons for it. We have heard computer glitch. We have heard that it was an interim pledge and a commitment. We have heard that it was a pro se case and, therefore, the computers do not exist in the Third Circuit the way they do in law firms here in Washington, D.C. I am just trying to find out what was told to you. To be very honest about it, if it had been said it was a mistake in the very beginning, I do not even think this issue would have taken more than 30 seconds of the Committee’s time, but since we have had so many different reasons for it, which we have been trying to ascertain exactly what had happened, and particularly since it was a pledge to the Committee and it was a sworn statement to the Committee, that we are wondering what the Bar Association, in its interview— Mr. PAYTON. I do not know the answer to your question. I do not believe that what you just said about what was on the list in 1993–

94 was known then. I was unaware of that, and I am not sure Judge Alito knew that. But in our discussion with him, we actually cut right through that and simply wanted him to tell us if he agreed this was a mistake. Did you just miss it? ‘‘Yes, I just missed it. It was a mistake.’’ The why then sort of became less significant.
Senator KENNEDY. Well, of course, Mr. Payton, he did. He took, during that same period of time, he took a name off the list, so he must have been familiar with it. He took the U.S. Attorney’s name off the list. We went through this. I would be glad to make available to you—you indicated that you had gone through the hearings on this, and I welcome the opportunity just to make available to you the same material, and to get your response.
Mr. TOBER. Senator, we indicated in our letter of explanation, as we always do, that we continue to monitor these proceedings, and we will be happy to revisit anything the Committee wishes us to look at.
Senator KENNEDY. I want to join in thanking you for the service of the Bar Association. This is a very challenging and in many sense, a thankless job. But I think the country is much better off. So it judiciary. I thank you for your service.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Hatch has stated an interest in regaining some of his reserve time. Senator HATCH. Just shortly. We appreciate the efforts that you make. We appreciate what the Bar Association is doing, and we appreciate what you have done in this particular case as well. Frankly, he did state right off the bat, early in his testimony, that he had made a mistake with regard to the Vanguard matter. On the other hand, are you aware that not only did he recuse himself once he realized he had made a mistake, but he asked the succeeding panel to retry the case. Are you aware of that? Mr. TOBER. Yes. Mr. PAYTON. Yes. Senator HATCH. Was that an appropriate thing to do? Mr. PAYTON. He asked that the Chief Judge identify a new panel, and I think that was the appropriate thing to do. Senator HATCH. That is what an honest, decent judge would do, is it not? Mr. TOBER. Sure, of course. Senator HATCH. You are all aware of this 28 USC, the U.S. Code statute on this, am I correct? Mr. TOBER. Correct. Senator HATCH. I mean that statute defines a financial interest for the courts. It says, ‘‘Financial interest means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, adviser, or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that ownership in a mutual or a common investment fund that holds securities is not a ‘‘financial interest’’ in such securities, unless the judge participates in the management of the fund.’’ Are you aware of that? Mr. PAYTON. Yes. Senator HATCH. Now, did he participate in the management of the fund?

650
The answer is no. Then if he did not participate in the management of the fund, would he have had, under normal circumstances, to recuse himself?
Mr. PAYTON. I think the normal circumstances is amplified by the representation to this Committee, which he acknowledged, independent of the obligation that you are talking about, would have caused him to not want these cases to come before him.
Senator HATCH. Right. But he made it clear that once he did realize that there was a mistake, even though he did not, according to this U.S. Code which is the basis, did not have to recuse himself, he did so because he had said in his statement that he would.
Mr. PAYTON. Yes, sir. Senator HATCH. And you knew that. And so, I take it, you do not find any real fault in the way he handled the Vanguard matter? Mr. TOBER. That is so. Mr. PAYTON. That is correct. Senator HATCH. That is correct? Mr. PAYTON. That is correct. Senator HATCH. Thank you so much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much for your service. Have you heard anything in these hearings that would cause you any concern or reason to change any of your views? Mr. TOBER. Well, the hearings are still going and I am still listening. But to the moment, Senator, I have been looking for any kind of material or discordant statement that would have been inconsistent with anything that we have learned or heard either through our interviews or our meeting with the nominee, and to the moment I am still comfortable that we understood the judicial and legal profile of Judge Alito when we reached our rating. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein. Senator Kyl? Senator KYL. Mr. Chairman, I do not have any questions, but I would like to thank the panel and the Bar Association for its, I wonder, how many hours of work put into verifying the qualifications of nominees, not just for the Supreme Court, but the other nominations, and particularly, Mr. Payton, your explanation of the matters that you testified to here. Thank you very, very much. Chairman SPECTER. Senator DeWine? Senator DEWINE. No questions, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Mr. Tober, you have 15 members of your committee that goes out, and they divide up the work and interview 300 individuals; is that what you did? Mr. TOBER. As it turned out, Senator, the Chair just gets into a lot of marshaling, and the Third Circuit representative had to recuse herself because she had argued a case before a panel that Judge Alito had served on before he had been nominated, and the decision had yet to come down, so she, by our standards, removed herself. So I had 13 people out in the field, interviewing well over 300 people, contacting over 2,000 people, putting together their

own written reports, marshaling the information from every corner and putting it in what turned out to be an 11-pound report. And when I first received it, as I told Ms. Tucker, I did not know whether to read it or send out birth announcements.
Senator SESSIONS. We are glad you do not have to do background work on Senators.
[Laughter.] Mr. TOBER. We are pleased it is done for the moment. Senator SESSIONS. One of the things, you know, some of us have complained about the ABA ratings, but there is so much value to it, it strikes me, because is it not true that sometimes when you are interviewing a lawyer that has been before the judge, or lost a case, a lawyer who has litigated against him, they will tell you things they may not come forward and say publicly, and that you can get a good—you feel like you get a better perspective on a nominee’s professional qualifications than you can get from reading the newspaper perhaps? Mr. TOBER. Thank you for that question. Let me try and answer it. The answer is yes. We have had the experience since 1948, when we started reporting our ratings to this Committee, of being able to get comprehensive confidential information from people who know the nominee directly in the trenches, whether it be a judge, a lawyer or other people in the community, and we are able to ask them with respect to integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament, with the full and complete understanding that there will be no attribution, there will be no embarrassment, that if it is important we need to know, and people indeed give us that kind of information. So, yes, it is a remarkable process, and if I have a moment, I would like to say it is a remarkable group of people that I have had the privilege to work with. Senator SESSIONS. And, Mr. Payton, you used the phrase that they held him in incredibly high regard. I think you are a premier litigator, you have argued before the Supreme Court. I am sure you used those words carefully. Mr. PAYTON. I did. Senator SESSIONS. I thank you for your service, and I think it has provided valuable insight to the Committee because you see these things out there, and it is important for the American people to know what do the people who really know and work with this judge think about him, and we value your comments. Mr. PAYTON. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Senator Graham? Senator GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would just like to echo what my colleagues have said about the service you are providing not only to the Committee, but I think the country, because most people in the country are not lawyers. That is probably a good thing. The idea of who you are getting as a person is important, and the homework you have done gives us a good picture of this particular man. But his judicial experience, compared to other people that you have reviewed, seems to me that being on the court for 15 years, you had a lot to look at.

Mr. TOBER. Well, we do not compare one nominee to another, Senator, as I am sure you can appreciate. But I will take the direct question, and indeed, I believe we said in our letter of evaluation that he has created an enormous record of public service, and his writings speak top that, and that is indeed what we have reviewed.
Senator GRAHAM. Thank you. About your rating, you know, we are all very pleased to the outcome here, but democracy is about a process, not an outcome. The rule of law is about a process, not an outcome. There may be an occasion where you will render a writing I will not agree with, and that is just the way it goes. But I think the process where you are involved really helps us a lot. I think it helps the country, and I appreciate the time you have taken from your families, from your business to do it.
Now, what may take normal people 30 seconds to figure out may take the Senate 3 days—
[Laughter.] Senator GRAHAM.—but we are going to ask one simple question about Vanguard. With this much material to have dealt with, and as many cases as he has heard, the first question for me about Judge Alito is, who am I getting here? Is an innocent mistake OK? I hope so because I make them all the time. What would I not want? I would not want someone who is into self-dealing. I would not want someone who skirts the ethical rules and plays as close to the line as they could. Would it be a fair statement that Judge Alito never plays close to the line, he tries to do it the best he can, to take the highest approach to ethics? Mr. PAYTON. I think that from what his colleagues who know him very well would say, is that they hold him in the highest regard with respect to his integrity, and I think that encompasses what you just said. Senator GRAHAM. Thank you very much. One last thought about Vanguard. What is in it for him to intentionally hear the case knowing that he should not? I have never found anybody that could give me a reason why this judge would make an intentional decision to avoid recusal when he should. Have you found a reason? Mr. PAYTON. I actually am unaware of anyone who has claimed that he intentionally did this. It was a mistake. Senator GRAHAM. And there is no benefit one could find for him intentionally doing it, based on the nature of the case. Mr. PAYTON. I am not aware of one. Senator GRAHAM. Thank you all. Mr. TOBER. Senator, if I could just add, I believe it was Professor Rotunda who submitted a report to this Committee, and I think there was a line in there that caught my attention. He said ‘‘Reasonable people can make reasonable mistakes.’’ And I think that captures what we thought we found, and when we spoke to Judge Alito about it, we were convinced that indeed that happened. Senator GRAHAM. Again, thank you for your service. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Graham. Senator Schumer? Senator SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a brief question because we have heard a lot about the ABA rating, which is something that is prized and important.

Your sheet here says it describes three qualities: integrity, professional competence, judicial temperament. Is that right?
Mr. TOBER. That is correct. Senator SCHUMER. So it would not at all get into what somebody’s judicial philosophy would be, is that correct? Mr. TOBER. That is also correct. Senator SCHUMER. And so if somebody were very far right or very far left, as long as they had integrity, professional competence or judicial temperament, you would give them—that is what you would rate them on? Mr. TOBER. Senator, we do not do politics. What we do is integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament. They are objective standards and that is what we bring to this Committee. Senator SCHUMER. And if one standard was, however one defined it, if somebody was out of the mainstream, again, your rating would not give us any inclination whether that was part of it? Mr. TOBER. If the suggestion was that they were out of the mainstream politically, That is correct. If they are out of the mainstream in terms of their judicial temperament, we might have a different thought. Senator SCHUMER. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Tober, Ms. Tucker, Mr. Payton. We very much appreciate your service and your being here today. Mr. TOBER. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. We next call the next panel—Judge Becker, Judge Scirica, Judge Barry, Judge Aldisert. Judge Garth will be coming to us electronically, but he appears on the screen. Welcome, Judge Garth. And Judge Gibbons and Judge Lewis. Pardon me. Senator Coburn, do you have questions of the ABA? Senator COBURN. No, Mr. Chairman. Senator SESSIONS. AMA, he would like to ask. Chairman SPECTER. I begin by welcoming the judges. By way of a brief introduction, I think it is worthy of comment how this panel came to be invited. Judge Becker was in my offices because since August of 2003 he has been performing mediation services on asbestos reform legislation, more than 40 meetings in a very, very tough legislative approach. And he was in my office last December, at a time when I was being interviewed by Kathy Kiley, of USA Today. And I introduced Judge Becker to Ms. Kiley, who asked him about Judge Alito. And without objection, I would like to make a part of the record the article which Ms. Kiley wrote for USA Today, dated December 14, 2005, which contains Judge Becker’s comments about Judge Alito. After that, I discussed with Judge Becker the possibility of his being a witness for Judge Alito. And after some discussions, Judge Becker checked out the various considerations and said he would be willing to do so if invited by the Committee. And then Judge Becker talked to the other judges who are here today, who also stated a willingness to appear, if invited by the Committee, and I then sent them formal letters of invitation. Now, to the judges. Judge Becker is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, 1954; Yale Law School, 1957; appointed by Presi-

dent Reagan to the district court in 1970 and to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 1981. He has really been performing services as the 101st Senator, and by way of full disclosure I have known Judge Becker since the fall of 1950, when he was a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania and I was a senior, and we have been good friends ever since.
Judge Becker, thank you for your service to the United States in so many capacities.
Judge BECKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. We have a procedure for five minutes. I don’t intend to bang the gavel on any of you judges, and not because you are judges, but because my gavel is almost broken. Judge Becker.
STATEMENT OF EDWARD R. BECKER, SENIOR JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA
Judge BECKER. Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy and other members of the Committee, Sam Alito became my colleague when he joined our court in 1990. Since that time, we have sat on over a thousand cases together, and I have therefore come to know him well as a judge and as a human being.
Many do not fully understand the intensity of the intellectual and personal relationship among appellate judges. We always sit together in panels of three and, in the course of deciding and writing up cases, engage in the most rigorous dialog with each other. The great violinist Isaac Stern, describing an afternoon of chamber music, once opined that after such a session, one knows his fellow quartet members better than a man knows his wife after 30 years of marriage.
Now, this analogy, hyperbole aside, vividly describes the intense relationship among appellate judges. I therefore believe myself to be a good judge of the four matters that I think are the central focus of this Committee as it decides whether to consent to this nomination—Sam Alito’s temperament, his integrity, his intellect and his approach to the law.
First, temperament. Sam Alito is a wonderful human being. He is gentle, considerate, unfailingly polite, decent, kind, patient and generous. He is modest and self-effacing. He shuns praise. When he had completed his tenth year of service on our court, Sam declined my offer extended as chief judge—I was then the chief judge of the court—to arrange the usual party to observe 10-year anniversaries. Sam was uncomfortable at the prospect of encomiums to his service.
Sam has never succumbed to the lure of big-city lights. He has a sense of place, which for him is not nearby New York City, but New Jersey, which to him has always been home.
Finally, there is an aspect of appellate judging that no one gets to see, no one but the judges themselves—how they behave in conference after oral argument, at which point the case is decided, and which I submit is the most critically important phase of the appellate judicial process.
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00666 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

655
In hundreds of conferences, I have never once heard Sam raise his voice, express anger or sarcasm, or even try to proselytize. Rather, he expresses his views in measured and tempered tones.
Second, integrity. Sam Alito is the soul of honor. I have never seen a chink in the armor of his integrity, which I view as total. That opinion is not undermined by the furor over the Vanguard issue, by which I remain baffled. My wife holds Vanguard mutual shares which I report on my financial disclosure form. However, I do not identify Vanguard on my recusal list because I am satisfied that my wife possesses no ownership interest in the Vanguard Management Company, which is what controls the recusal determination. She has never received a proxy statement, an opportunity to vote for directors, or any indicia of ownership, other than her aliquot share and the fund to the extent of her investment. I believe that the view of Dean Rotunda which is in your record explains why Judge Alito was not required under the law to recuse himself in the suit against Vanguard.
Third, intellect. Judge Alito’s intellect is of a very high order. He is brilliant, he is highly analytical, and meticulous and careful in his comments and his written work. He is a wonderful partner in dialog. He will think of things his colleagues have missed. He is not doctrinaire, but rather is open to differing views and will often change his mind in light of the views of a colleague. Contrary to some reports, Sam does not dissent often. According to our court statistics, in the last 6 years he has dissented only 16 times, a little over two cases per year. That is the same number that I have dissented, and fewer than a number of our colleagues.
In my view, Sam Alito has the intellect to sit on the Supreme Court. I know all of its members. I know them reasonably well, and in my view he will be a strong and independent Justice, his own man. Finally, Sam’s intellect is not abstract, but practical. He does not mistake the obscure for the profound.
Fourth, approach to the law. As I address this topic, I am acutely aware of the deep concern of the members of the Committee about this subject. I am also aware that my role here is to testify to fact, not to opinion, and hence I will express neither normative or predictive judgments.
The Sam Alito that I have sat with for 15 years is not an ideologue. He is not a movement person. He is a real judge deciding each case on the facts and the law, not on his personal views, whatever they may be. He scrupulously adheres to precedent. I have never seen him exhibit a bias against any class of litigation or litigants.
He was a career prosecutor, but in the numerous criminal cases on which we have sat together, if the evidence was insufficient or the search was flawed, he would vote to overturn the conviction. And if the record did not support summary judgment against the plaintiff in an employment discrimination or civil rights case, he would vote to reverse. His credo has always been fairness.
Now, I know that there has been controversy about certain ideological views expressed in some 20-year-old memos. Whatever these views may be, his judging does not reflect them. I think that the public does not understand what happens when you become a judge. When you take that judicial oath, you become a different

656
person. You decide cases not to reach the result that you would like, but based on what the facts and the law command. What you decide as a judge are not general principles, but the case in front of you. You do it as narrowly as possible. That is what Sam always does, with great respect for precedent. Sam Alito has been faithful to that judicial oath.
Now, my final point relates to another facet of his approach to the law, and the best calipers that I could find to measure his approach to the law was to compare it with my own. I have been a Federal judge for 35 years, one week and one day. My opinions would fill many book shelves, but I think that I am fairly viewed as a mainstream or centrist judge.
A computer survey run by our court librarian received 1,050 opinions in cases on which Sam Alito and I sat together. In these cases, we disagreed 27 times, which is probably about the same number that I would have disagreed with most other colleagues. Some cases turned on a reading of the record, others on how rigorously or flexibly we interpreted the reach of a statutory or constitutional provision or a State court’s jurisprudence, or applied our usually deferential standard of review. But in every case on which we differed, Sam’s position was closely reasoned and supportable either by the record or by his interpretation of the law, or both.
The short of it, members of the Committee, is that Sam Alito is a superb judge in terms of temperament, integrity and intellect, and he has exhibited a careful, temperate, case-by-case approach to the law.
Thank you for the opportunity to address you. [The prepared statement of Judge Becker appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Becker. We now turn to Chief Judge Anthony Scirica, who, like Judge Becker, has known Judge Alito on the Third Circuit for the 15 years of Judge Alito’s service there. Judge Scirica became Chief Judge in May of 2003, succeeding Chief Judge Edward Becker. Judge Scirica has a bachelor’s degree from Wesleyan, 1962; Michigan Law School, 1965; appointed to the district court by President Reagan in 1984, and to the circuit court also by President Reagan in 1987. Thank you very much for coming in, Judge Scirica, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF ANTHONY J. SCIRICA, CHIEF JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA
Judge SCIRICA. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. For the last 15 years, I have worked with Judge Alito. For 15 years, we have decided thousands of cases while serving on the same court of appeals. On most cases, we have agreed, but not always. Judges don’t always agree on every case.
As the Chief Justice remarked last summer, much like a baseball umpire, a judge calls balls and strikes. If the pitch is down the middle or way outside, the call is straightforward, but many pitches are on the corners and then the calls are difficult. These

657
cases require hard thought, and these are the cases where a judge earns his or her keep.
In 15 years on the court of appeals, Judge Alito has more than earned his keep. He is a thoughtful, careful, principled judge who is guided by a deep and abiding respect for the rule of law. He is intellectually honest, he is fair, he is ethical. He has the intellect, the integrity, the compassion and the judicial temperament that are the hallmarks of an outstanding judge.
On three separate occasions, I spoke with the representative of the American Bar Association during its evaluation process. My views and those of my colleagues on the court were sought by the American Bar Association because we have a unique perspective on Judge Alito, a perspective that no one else has. Anyone can read and interpret his opinions, but we know Judge Alito from almost daily contact over a period of years. We have sat together in the same conference room. We have discussed the cases, we have decided them, and we have exchanged legal memoranda.
Judge Alito approaches each case with an open mind and determines the proper application of the relevant law to the facts at hand. He has a deep respect for precedent. His reasoning is scrupulous and meticulous. He does not reach out to decide issues that are not presented in the case. His personal views, whatever they might be, do not jeopardize the independence of his legal reasoning or his capacity to approach each issue with an open mind. Like a good judge, he considers and deliberates before drawing a conclusion.
I have never seen signs of a pre-determined outcome or view, nor have I seen him express impatience with litigants or with colleagues with whom he may ultimately disagree. He is attentive and respectful of all views, and is keenly aware that judicial decisions are not academic exercises, but have far-reaching consequences on people’s lives.
We admire him as a person. Despite his extraordinary talents and accomplishments, Judge Alito is modest and unassuming. His thoughtful and inquiring mind, so evident in his opinions, is equally evident in his personal relationships. He is concerned and interested in the lives of those around him. He has an impeccable work ethic, but he takes the time to be a thoughtful friend to his colleagues.
He treats everyone on our court and everyone on our court staff with respect, with dignity, and with compassion. He is committed to his country and to his profession, but he is equally committed to his family, his friends and his community. He is an admirable judge and an admirable person.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Scirica. We turn now to Third Circuit Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, a graduate of Mount Holyoke, 1958, Columbia University in 1962, with a master’s and a law degree from Hofstra, 1974. Judge Barry was in the U.S. Attorney’s Office before Judge Alito was there, appointed to the District Court in 1983 by President Reagan and to the Circuit Court in 1999 by President Clinton. She has worked with Judge Alito for the past 6 years as colleagues on the Third Circuit.

STATEMENT OF MARYANNE TRUMP BARRY, JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA
Judge BARRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, members of the Committee. It is my privilege to appear before you and it is a particular privilege to speak on behalf of my friend and colleague, Judge Samuel Alito.
Now, I warn you, I may be a little free and call him ‘‘Sam’’ on occasion because Judge Alito and I go back almost 30 years, to 1977. In 1977, Judge Alito came to the United States Attorney’s Office in the District of New Jersey following his clerkship with Judge Leonard Garth, who was and remains a giant on our court. Sam was assigned—see, I did it—to the Appeals Division and I was the chief of that division, although in those days, I didn’t have very much more experience than he did. Now, I have said Appeals Division. That sounds very much more substantial than it was for what it was, the three Assistant United States Attorneys working very, very hard at a very, very responsible job.
We handled all the criminal appeals of those defendants who were convicted at trial. It was our job to master the record, to analyze the issues, to read the relevant cases, to write a persuasive brief on behalf of the United States, and, if necessary, to argue the case on the floor of the Court of Appeals. Nobody did it better than Sam Alito. And if there were any doubt on that score, the best evidence is the fact that after just 4 years as an Assistant United States Attorney, he went directly to the Office of the Solicitor General. Only the best are able to do that.
For the next 6 years, Judge Alito distinguished himself with public service in Washington, D.C., and then he returned to the District of New Jersey in 1987 as the United States Attorney. Important cases were brought on his watch, organized crime cases, drug trafficking cases, public corruption cases. I know, because I was there, and as a district court judge at that time, having been appointed by President Reagan, I handled some of his more important cases.
Now, I mentioned the cases that were handled on his watch for another reason. The tone of the United States Attorney’s Office comes from the top. The standard of excellence is set at the top. Samuel Alito set a standard of excellence that was contagious, his commitment to doing the right thing, never playing fast and loose with the record, never taking a short cut, his emphasis on first-rate work, his fundamental decency. The Assistant United States Attorneys who worked for him were proud to do so. They admired him completely.
Now, of course, in 1990, Judge Alito became Judge Alito, and you have heard the most glowing things said about Sam as a colleague on our court. I embrace every glowing statement.
Let me just conclude with this. Judge Alito is a man of remarkable intellectual gifts. He is a man with impeccable legal credentials. He is a fair-minded man, a modest man, a humble man, and he reveres the rule of law. If confirmed, Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr.

will serve as a marvelous and distinguished Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Barry. We turn now to Judge Ruggero Aldisert. He has a bachelor’s degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1942 and a law degree from the same institution in 1947, with intervening service in the Marine Corps. He served on the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County from 1961 to 1968, at which point he was appointed to the Third Circuit by President Lyndon Johnson. Judge Aldisert and I were reminiscing about my predecessor, Judge—Senator—he used to be a judge—Senator Joe Clark, whose seat I now occupy. He was Chief Judge from 1984 to 1986 and took senior status in 1986. He has been an adjunct professor at the University of Pittsburgh and has served with Judge Alito on the Third Circuit for the past 15 years. Thank you for coming all the way from California, Judge Aldisert, to be with us today and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF RUGGERO J. ALDISERT, SENIOR JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA
Judge ALDISERT. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I thank you for this invitation to offer my views on my colleague, but before proceeding into my formal statement, I want the record to show that there was a discussion this morning about ages of judges. Well, I am an old man.
[Laughter.] Judge ALDISERT. And I will tell you how old I am. There is a certain distinguished United States Senator sitting up there who I swore in as a lawyer in the city of Pittsburgh over 40 years ago, and that is Orrin Hatch. [Laughter.] Judge ALDISERT. And I will also say that I presided over the first jury trial that he ever tried, and he won the case. Senator LEAHY. Oh, that is sweet. [Laughter.] Senator HATCH. I am glad you said that, Judge. They don’t believe that I did. Senator LEAHY. I never knew you won one. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. They have always gotten along very well together, Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch. Judge ALDISERT. When I first testified before this Committee in 1968, I was seeking confirmation in my own nomination to the Federal Circuit Court. I speak now as the most senior judge on the Third Circuit, and I begin my brief testimony with some personal background. In May 1960, I campaigned with John F. Kennedy in the critical Presidential primaries of West Virginia. The next year, I ran for judge, as was indicated, and I was on the Democratic ticket, and I served 8 years as a State trial judge. As the Chairman indicated, Senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania was my chief sponsor when

President Lyndon Johnson nominated me to the Court of Appeals, and Senator Robert F. Kennedy from New York was one of my key supporters.
Now, why do I say this? I make this as a point that political loyalties become irrelevant when I became a judge. The same has been true in the case of Judge Alito, who served honorably in two Republican administrations before he was appointed to our court. Judicial independence is simply incompatible with political loyalties, and Judge Alito’s judicial record on our court bears witness to this fundamental truth.
I have been a judge for 45 of my 86 years, and based on my experience, I can represent to this Committee that Judge Alito has to be included among the first rank of the 44 judges with whom I have served on the Third Circuit, and including another 50 judges on five other courts of appeals on which I have sat since taking senior status.
Moreover, I have been a longtime student of the judicial process. I have written four books on the subject and more than 30 law review articles, and this study required me to study the current work of 22 Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, and I have read hundreds of opinions of appellate judges of every Federal circuit, every State, and every political stripe. The great Cardozo taught us long ago, the judge even when he is free is not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. This means that the crucial values of predictability, reliance, and fundamental fairness must be honored, and as his judicial record makes plain, Judge Alito has taken this teaching to heart. He believes that legal outcomes will follow the law as dictated by the facts of the particular case, whether the facts involve commercial interests, government regulation, or intimate relationships.
According to these criteria, Mr. Chairman, Judge Alito is already a great judge. We who have heard his probing questions during oral arguments, we who have been privy to his wise and insightful comments in our private decisional conferences, we who have observed at first hand his impartial approach to decisionmaking and his thoughtful judicial temperament and know his carefully crafted opinions, we who are his colleagues are convinced that he will also be a great Justice.
If Judge Alito is confirmed, as I believe wholeheartedly he deserves to be, he will succeed a Justice who has gained a reputation as a practical Justice, whose resistance to ideologically driven solutions has positioned her as a swing vote on the Court. And as has been heard several times in this hearing, Justice O’Connor in 1995 described her approach to judging. What she said then is even more important today, and I quote: ‘‘It cannot be too often stated that the greatest threats to our constitutional freedoms come in times of crisis...The only way for judges to mediate these conflicting impulses is to do what they should do anyway: stay close to the record in each case that appears before them and make their judgments based on that alone.’’ And knowing Sam Alito as I do, I am struck by how accurately these words also describe the way in which he has performed his work as a United States circuit judge. That is why, with utmost enthusiasm, I recommend that he be confirmed as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Judge Aldisert appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Aldisert. We now turn to Judge Leonard Garth, who is coming to us—you see him on the television screen, coming to us from California. Judge Garth is a graduate of Columbia, 1942, served in the United States Army, Lieutenant, from 1943 to 1945, and then from the Harvard Law School where he graduated in 1952. In 1969, he was appointed to the district court by President Nixon and then to the circuit court by President Nixon in 1973, a lecturer at Rutgers Law School and the Seton Law Hall School; has known Judge Alito since Judge Alito clerked for Judge Garth back in 1976 and 1977 and has served with him on the Third Circuit for the 15 years of Judge Alito’s tenure there. Judge Garth, we very much appreciate your being with us, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF LEONARD I. GARTH, SENIOR JUDGE, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
Judge GARTH. Thank you, Senator Specter, Senator Leahy, and the honorable members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and, of course, my own family of judges who have preceded me in speaking to you today.
I, too, am privileged to appear before you today, albeit by videoconferencing rather than in person. I cannot be with you in person because I recently had some major spinal surgery, and I find it extremely difficult and painful to travel.
As Senator Specter has indicated, I have served as a Federal judge for some 36 years: as a district court judge in New Jersey, and since August 1973 as a member of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
Now, I do want to interject and say that in that respect, perhaps Judge Aldisert is older than I am, but not by many days. And I am almost as old as he is, but not quite as handsome as Judge Barry of my court.
[Laughter.] Judge GARTH. I hope you will forgive that aside, but I want to ask you for something else to forgive me. I have heard all of my colleagues speak so eloquently and, I will use the term that Judge Barry used, glowingly about Judge Alito. But I have known him just a little bit longer and in a different capacity over the course of his career. Following his graduation from law school, he served as one of my two law clerks in 1976 and 1977. And as you have heard, since 1990 he has served as my colleague on the court of appeals. During the interim years, because of the relationship that we developed during his clerkship and the fact that both he and I are New Jersey residents, we remained close to one another. Hence, I think I can speak knowledgeably about Sam’s qualifications, his talents, his discretion, his honesty, his fairness, and his integrity. These are qualities that Judge Alito possesses now and has possessed since the very beginning of his legal career.

Let me first tell you about Sam’s clerkship with me. As you may know, a law clerk is a judge’s legal advisor and a sounding board, if I may use that term. But he or she often becomes much more than that—a member of the judge’s extended family. And as a result, a judge gets to know his law clerk in a particularly personal way. I knew Sam in this personal way at the very beginning of his career as a lawyer. For that reason, I think I have a unique perspective to share with you about him.
I chose Sam to be my law clerk in 1976 from among the literally hundreds of applicants who sent their resumes to me and the other judges of our court that year. Sam was still a law student when I interviewed him, but he struck me in that encounter as fiercely intelligent, deeply motivated, and extremely capable.
I did not know at that time that Sam was the son of Samuel Alito, Sr. That is a gentleman who had impressed me very, very much as a witness in a New Jersey redistricting case that I heard about 1972. Once I made the connection, however, I fully understood why Sam was so impressive and why he regarded—and regards today—his father as a role model.
During his tenure with me, Sam bore out all my initial impressions of his excellence—impressions which had led me to engage him. He was a brilliant and exceptional assistant to me. He enabled me to test judicial theories and to fashion appropriate judgments in each case that came before our court.
I have had some 85 law clerks assisting me in chambers over the course of my career on the bench. They have all been extremely well qualified in all ways to serve a court of appeals judge. Sam Alito stands out even among that very elite group.
During the year that he was my law clerk, Sam and I frequently took an afternoon walk near the courthouse in Newark and discussed the cases while we walked. I can tell you that the recommendations and arguments that Sam made about those cases were, as my colleagues have pointed out, always reasoned, principled, and supported by precedent. I developed then a deep respect for Sam’s analytical ability, his legal acumen, his judgment, his institutional values, and, yes, even his sense of humor, which, if he is confirmed, as I hope he might, will probably compete with that of other Justices.
Few of the cases that come before our court are ‘‘slam dunk’’ cases. Most involved difficult questions on which reasonable people can disagree. And, generally, Sam and I reached agreement after discussing these cases, but more than once we did not. Even in those latter cases, the ones on which we disagreed, I understood and respected the positions that Sam advanced and the contours of his analyses.
Our afternoon walks invariably ended at a neighborhood store— T.M. Ward Company—where we purchased peanuts and coffee. I note parenthetically that Ward’s has since honored Sam by naming a special blend of coffee that he favors ‘‘Judge Alito’s Bold Justice Blend.’’ I think there are a few of us that have that distinction.
After he left my chambers, Sam continued on in public service, as you have heard. In a letter to the then Deputy Assistant Attorney General Arnold Burns, I endorsed Sam’s candidacy for United

663
States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, and I want to just read you what I wrote. This was a long, long time ago:
I can certify to Mr. Alito’s integrity, ability, discretion, and honesty. Above and beyond those qualities, however, I believe his talents as a lawyer are exceptional. I am sure that his tenure in government service since he has left my chambers has reflected the fact that he is a thorough, meticulous, intelligent, and resourceful attorney and that his judgments are mature and responsible. Indeed, he was one of the finest law clerks I have had the privilege to engage. And if I were to rate him on the basis of 1 to 10–10 being the highest rating—he would, without question, receive a 10plus rating.
I stressed these same attributes when I endorsed Sam for membership on our court several years later. He has more than lived up to my rating and the qualities that I attributed to him in the 15 years since he joined the court and became my colleague.
Sam is an intellectually gifted and morally principled judge. We have not always agreed on the outcome of every case, as I have just recently stated. Just this fall, for example, Sam dissented from a majority opinion that I wrote in an Employee Retirement Income Security Act—ERISA—case. In that case, Sam and I disagreed about how two provisions of the statute interact. I and the other majority judge were attracted in large part to the reasoning of the Second Circuit. Judge Alito, on the other hand, was attracted by the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit. Even in the cases on which we disagree, however, I always respect Sam’s opinion, just as I did during our afternoon walks when he was my law clerk.
Sam is also a prudent judge. Make no mistake: he is no revolutionary. He is a sound jurist, always respectful of the institution and the precepts that led to decisions in the cases under review.
I have heard concerns expressed about whether Judge Alito can be fair and evenhanded. Let me assure you from my extensive experiences with him and with my knowledge of him, going back, as I have stated, over 30 years—that he will always vote in accordance with the Constitution and laws as enacted by Congress. His fairness, his judicial demeanor and actions, and his commitment to the law, all of those qualities which my colleagues and I agree he has, do not permit him to be influenced by individual preferences or any personal predilections.
As you may know, when the judges of our court meet in conference—and I think Judge Becker referred to this in his remarks—we are the only individuals in chambers. No law clerks, no assistants, no administrative personnel, or indeed anyone else attend these conferences. I can tell you with confidence that at no time during the 15 years that Judge Alito has served with me and with our colleagues on the court, and the countless number of times that we have sat today in private conference after hearing oral argument, has he ever expressed anything that could be described as an agenda, nor has he ever expressed any personal predilections about a case or an issue or a principle that would affect his decisions.
He has a deep and abiding respect for the role of stare decisis and established law. I appreciate, of course, that the Supreme Court can retreat from its earlier decisions, but it does so rarely
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00675 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

664
and only in very special circumstances, and I am convinced that if Judge Alito is confirmed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, he will continue to honor stare decisis as he did as a law clerk and as he has done as a member of our court. He will sit among those jurists whose qualities of fairness and of principles are the loadstar of the judiciary. In my opinion, Sam is as well qualified as the most qualified Justices currently sitting on the Supreme Court.
A word about Sam’s demeanor is in order. Sam is and always has been reserved, soft-spoken, and thoughtful. He is also modest, and I would even say self-effacing, and these are the characteristics I think of when I think of Sam’s personality. It is rare to find humility such as his in someone of such extraordinary ability.
Over the 30 years I have known Sam, I have seen him grow professionally into the reserved, mature, independent, and apolitical jurist that graces our court today. I regard him as the most qualified member of our court to be considered as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I know that just as Judge Alito has brought and brings grace and luster to the Third Circuit, so too will he bring grace and luster to the U.S. Supreme Court if he is confirmed.
Thank you, members of the Senate Judiciary. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Garth, coming from, I have just been advised, from Phoenix, Arizona. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Judge Garth appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Our next witness is Judge John Gibbons, a graduate of Holy Cross in 1947 with a bachelor’s, Harvard Law School in 1950. He was nominated to the Third Circuit by President Nixon in 1970, Chief Judge from 1987 to 1990, at which time he resigned to become a professor of law at Seton Hall University. He now is in the practice of law. He has known Judge Alito for more than 20 years, when Judge Alito was a U.S. Attorney and tried cases before Judge Gibbons. Thank you very much for being with us today, Judge Gibbons, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF JOHN J. GIBBONS, JUDGE (RETIRED), U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, AND DIRECTOR, GIBBONS, DEL DEO, DOLAN, GRIFFINGER AND VECCHIONE, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY
Judge GIBBONS. Mr. Chairman and members of the Judiciary Committee, as you all probably know, or as Senator Specter has just said, I was a member of that court of appeals where Judge Alito is now a member for 20 years, and indeed, it was my retirement from that court 16 years ago that created the vacancy which Judge Alito filled on the court of appeals.
Since his appointment, lawyers in the firm of which I am a member have been regular litigators in the courts of the Third Circuit, not only on behalf of clients who pay us handsomely for such representation, but also frequently for the firm’s Gibbons Fellowship Program on behalf of nonpaying clients whose cases have presented those courts with challenging human rights issues. The Gibbons Fellowship Program is certainly a significant part of our practice,

665
as amply demonstrated by the fact that since 1990, Gibbons Fellows lawsuits have resulted in 115 reported judicial decisions.
This Committee should appreciate that the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has been for the 50-plus years that I have followed or participated in its work a centrist legal institution. An important reason why that is so is that many years ago, the court adopted the requirement that all opinions intended for publication must, prior to filing, be circulated by the opinion writer not only to the members of the three-judge panel, but also to the other active judges on the court. The purpose of this internal operating rule was to permit each active judge not only to comment upon the opinion writer’s treatment of Third Circuit and Supreme Court precedent, but also to vote to take the case en banc for rehearing by the full court if the judge thought that the opinion was outside the bounds of settled precedents. Thus, the level of interaction among the Third Circuit appellate judges has, for a half-century, been unusually high.
This Committee should also appreciate that appointment to an appellate court where one has life tenure is a transforming experience. I remember a former judicial colleague saying to me once after several years on the bench, ‘‘John, what other job in the world is there in which you can look in the mirror while you are shaving and say to yourself, all I have to do today is the right thing according to the law? ’’ A good judge puts aside interests of former clients, interests of organizations they have belonged to, and interests of the political organization that may have been instrumental in one’s appointment. I personally experienced that transformation and I witnessed it repeatedly in the judicial colleagues who joined the court after I did.
These two points, the unusual internal cohesion of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the transformative experience of serving on a court protected by life tenure, suggests to me that the Committee members, in determining whether or not to vote in favor of confirming Judge Alito, should concentrate not on what he thought or said as a recent Princeton graduate or as a young lawyer seeking advancement as an employee of the Department of Justice, but principally, if not exclusively, on his record as an Article III appellate judge.
If you look, as you should, at that 15-year record as a whole, you cannot in good conscience conclude that Judge Alito will bring to the Supreme Court any attitude other than the one held by the colleague I mentioned who thought important thoughts about judging every morning while he was shaving. He has consistently followed the practice of carefully considering both Supreme Court and Third Circuit precedents. Very few of the opinions he has written for a unanimous panel or for a panel majority have deemed his colleagues among the active judges to vote to take the case en banc. The cases in which he participated that produced dissenting opinions by him, or from him, all, it seems to me, were close cases in which either the law or the evidentiary record were such that equally conscientious judges could quite reasonably disagree about the outcome.
Take, for example, cases presenting challenges to State regulations of abortion, certainly a hot-button topic for many people who
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00677 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

666
are opposing Judge Alito’s confirmation. I found four such cases in which he participated. In three of them, he decided against State regulations that might have put a burden on a woman’s choice for an abortion. In the fourth case, about which a lot has been said, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, Judge Alito dissented from a majority opinion, holding unconstitutional the Pennsylvania spousal consent provision for an abortion. And it is that dissent which the opponents of his confirmation talk about most frequently. They seem to urge that on the basis of that dissent, Judge Alito is so far out of the mainstream of constitutional law that his confirmation will endanger the constitutional protection of civil rights practically across the board.
In your consideration of that dissent, I suggest that you should take into account these points. First, at the time the circuit considered the Pennsylvania spousal consent statute, the Supreme Court had not yet decided whether States could impose such a requirement, and second, the court of appeals majority invalidated the statute. Had the Supreme Court simply denied certiorari, that invalidation would have remained in place. Instead, at least four Justices voted to grant certiorari. If the issue of the statute’s constitutionality was so overwhelmingly clear, why was certiorari granted to endorse the Third Circuit’s majority position? Clearly, Planned Parenthood v. Casey was, at the time the court of appeals acted, a case over which conscientious judges could reasonably disagree. Otherwise, the Supreme Court would simply have denied certiorari.
Nothing in the Supreme Court’s case law dealing with abortion relieves the appellate judges and intermediate appellate courts from the duty of making a conscientious effort to fit the case before them within that case law, and the four abortion cases in which he participated show that that is exactly what Judge Alito has done.
Another opinion that has caught the attention of those clamoring for Judge Alito’s scalp is his dissent in United States v. Rybar, in which he would have held that the Supreme Court decision in Lopez prohibited Congress from regulating mere possession of machine guns. A majority opinion upheld this statute. Unlike Casey, the Supreme Court didn’t review that case. Thus, the question of the reach of Lopez was left open, and when the issue reached the Ninth Circuit in the United States v. Stewart in 2003, it adopted Judge Alito’s dissenting position. Some opponents of his confirmation have relied on that dissent in suggesting that Judge Alito is perhaps a captive of the right-wing gun lobby. This Committee, after actually reading Lopez and Rybar and the Ninth Circuit case, I suggest, cannot in good conscience find the dissent to be anything more than a good faith effort to somewhat unenthusiastically apply the perhaps unfortunate Supreme Court precedent of Lopez. Indeed, in his Rybar dissenting opinion, Judge Alito suggested how Congress could cure the Lopez violation.
The extent to which opponents of Judge Alito’s confirmation largely ignore his overall 15-year record as a judge suggests, at least to me, that the real target for many of the somewhat vitriolic comments on the nomination is less him than the executive branch administration that nominated him. The Committee members should not think for a moment that I support Judge Alito’s nomination because I am a dedicated defender of that administration. On

the contrary, I and my firm have been litigating with that administration for a number of years over its treatment of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere, and we are certainly chagrined at the position that is being taken by the administration with respect to those detainees.
It seems not unlikely that one or more of the detainee cases that we are handling will be before the Supreme Court again. I do not know the views of Judge Alito respecting the issues that may be presented in those cases. I would not ask him, and if I did, he would not tell me. I am confident, however, that as an able legal scholar and a fair-minded justice, he will give the arguments, legal and factual, that may be presented on behalf of our clients careful and thoughtful consideration without any predisposition in favor of the position of the executive branch. That is more than detainees have received from the Congress of the United States, which recently enacted legislation stripping Federal courts of habeas corpus jurisdiction to hear many of the detainees’ claims without even holding a Committee hearing.
Justice Alito is a careful, thoughtful, intelligent, fair-minded jurist who will add significantly to the Court’s reputation as the necessary expositor of constitutional limits on the political branches of the government. He should be confirmed.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Gibbons. [The prepared statement of Judge Gibbons appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Our final witness on the panel is former Third Circuit Judge Tim Lewis, a graduate of Tufts University in 1976, a law degree from Duquesne in 1980. He served as an Assistant United States Attorney before President Bush the Elder appointed him to the Western District Court, and then in 1992, President Bush the Elder nominated him to the Third Circuit. Judge Lewis resigned in 1999 and now is co-chair of the appellate practice group at the Schnader Harrison office. He serves as co-chair of the National Committee on the Right to Counsel, a public service group dedicated to adequate representation of indigents. Judge Lewis and Judge Alito served together on the Third Circuit for 7 years. We appreciate your being here, Judge Lewis, and the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY K. LEWIS, JUDGE (RETIRED), U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, AND COUNSEL, SCHNADER HARRISON SEGAL & LEWIS LLP, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Judge LEWIS. Thank you very much, Senator Specter. Thank you, members of the Committee. It is a pleasure and an honor to be here today.
When Thurgood Marshall announced his intention to resign as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in conference one day, the first person to respond was Chief Justice Rehnquist. Chief Justice Rehnquist’s words were, ‘‘No, Thurgood, no. Please don’t. We need you here.’’
Shortly thereafter, when Justice Marshall had resigned, he was interviewed, and in the course of that interview was asked about Chief Justice Rehnquist. And during that interview he said, ‘‘This

is the best Chief that I have ever served under.’’ and went on to extol Chief Justice Rehnquist’s service on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Now, I was, quite frankly, stunned by both of those observations when I learned them at the time, and it wasn’t until I had served for a period of time as a judge on the United States court of appeals that it all began to make sense to me.
It is no coincidence to anyone who is familiar with my body of work while I served on the United States court of appeals and my body of work since having left the court that I happen to be sitting on the far left of this panel here this afternoon. And yet I am here, and what I have just related about the exchanges between Justice Marshall and Justice Rehnquist and Justice Marshall’s later observation about the Chief Justice helps explain why I am here, because it is true that during the time that I served with Judge Alito, there were times when we did not agree.
I am openly and unapologetically pro-choice and always have been. I am openly—and it is very well known—a committed human rights and civil rights activist and am actively engaged in that process, as my time permits and my law practice permits today and through my law practice at Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis. I am very much involved in a number of endeavors that one who is familiar with Judge Alito’s background and experience may wonder, well, why are you here today saying positive things about his prospects as a Justice on the Supreme Court? And the reason is that, having worked with him, I came to respect what I think are the most important qualities for anyone who puts on a robe, no matter what court they will serve on, but in particular the U.S. Supreme Court, and first and foremost among these is intellectual honesty.
As Judge Becker and others have alluded to, it is in conference, after we have heard oral argument and are not propped up by law clerks—we are alone as judges discussing the cases—that one really gets to know, gets a sense of the thinking of our colleagues. And I cannot recall one instance during conference or during any other experience that I had with Judge Alito, but in particular during conference, when he exhibited anything remotely resembling an ideological bent. That does not mean that I agreed with him, but he did not come to conference or come to any decision that he made during the time that I worked with him based on what I perceived to be an ideological bent or a result-oriented demeanor or approach. He was intellectually honest, and I would say rigorously so, even with respect to those areas that he and I did not agree.
Second, I have no hesitation in commending his commitment to principle, both in how he went about his work on the Third Circuit, how he came to his decisions. It was through a very difficult process we all would put ourselves through, but in Sam’s case I think that I can say that no one worked harder at coming to what he thought was the right decision than Judge Alito.
And, finally, though we did disagree, it was always respectful, and that is what I came to understand as probably the most important facet of appellate judging. No one—and I mean no one—has a corner on the marketplace of ideas in terms of what is best, what is right. We have different approaches, and it is very important that we maintain different approaches in positioning and in pushing forward our sense of—our jurisprudence. They do not have to

be the same. In fact, I think that it is contrary to the best interests of democratic government for there to be some monolithic approach to judicial decisionmaking on the United States Supreme Court or on any other court.
Sam Alito practiced a form of jurisprudence that I think is best referred to as judicial restraint, judicial deference. It is in many respects a more conservative form of jurisprudence than was my own. And that is fine. That is perfectly fine. And as a matter of fact, I dare say it is important, because through the exchanges we learned from one another and I think were a better court.
I know that this is the case on the Supreme Court, as it is reflected in Chief Justice Rehnquist’s observation when Justice Marshall announced his resignation. And I think that it is important that different approaches be respected.
So in the end, I am here as a matter of principle and as a matter of my own commitment to justice, fairness, and my sense that Sam Alito is uniformly qualified in all important respects to serve as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court.
Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Lewis. This panel, this distinguished panel, has been accorded much more time than we customarily allow because of the very large number of witnesses which we have. But out of deference to your positions and your coming here and your unique knowledge, we have done that. I would like to ask each of you a great many questions, but I am going to limit myself to 5 minutes. And I would urge that the responses be sound clips. You have not had as much experience at that as we have, but on the networks, a sound clip goes for about 8 seconds and locally about 18 seconds. You don’t have to quite do that, but as close as you can. You can start my clock now. Judge Becker, the conference is a unique opportunity, as has been explained, to really find out about what your colleagues think. Do you think, is it your judgment that Judge Alito would allow his personal views on a matter to influence his decisions as a Justice? Judge BECKER. I do not think—I am confident that he would not. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Garth, you spoke about stare decisis. You have been quoted about your views of Judge Alito as to his approach, if confirmed, where the bounds of the Supreme Court Justice on stare decisis are not the same as a court of appeals judge. As Judge Gibbons has noted, the issue of a woman’s right to choose has become a very central factor in our deliberations. Do you have any insights which you would care to offer as to how Judge Alito would weigh the issue of stare decisis on that particular subject? Judge GARTH. I can only say that I have heard Judge Alito speak as to how he would approach and process any judicial problem, and it would be presumptuous of me to even think of how he would rule on that subject. But I can tell you that when it comes to applying the precedents in our court and of the Supreme Court, he has always been assiduous in the manner in which he has applied them and he has always had good reason and principle. I can’t say more than repeat again that I believe that Judge Alito, when he described to the Committee how he would rule on

a case and what he would do in respect of stare decisis, I could not express it better than he did.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Barry, you have sat with him in these private conferences, known him for a long time, back to the days when you were in—and I had not noted that you were in the U.S. Attorney’s Office when he was an assistant. How would you evaluate Judge Alito on his consideration of women’s issues?
Judge BARRY. If I had to add anything to my initial testimony, I would have stated more about what Sam and I did together on this wonderful court and how reasonable he was and how he never indicated bias of any kind.
I told you at the outset I have known Judge Alito for almost 30 years. I have the utmost respect for him. I have never heard him say one thing that would give me any reason to believe that he would give other than the most careful consideration to what you have described as women’s issues.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Lewis, I have a question for you, and then I am going to propound a question for the other three judges before my red light goes on. I would like you to be a little more specific in your evaluation on Judge Alito as to how he would handle the civil rights issue. I am not going to wait for you to start to answer because my red light will go on in advance. Then I am going to ask Judge Scirica, Judge Aldisert, and Judge Gibbons to address the subject, which has concerned this Committee in some detail, as to whether there is any tilt in Judge Alito’s approach to the powerful, to the Government, as opposed to the average citizens, whom we characterized as ‘‘the little guy.’’
Would you start, Judge Lewis, with your evaluation? Judge LEWIS. Yes, I will. Thank you, Senator. Let me begin by saying that if I believed that Sam Alito might be hostile to civil rights as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court, I can guarantee you that I would not be sitting here today. That is the first thing that I want to make clear. My experience in civil rights cases on the Third Circuit were primarily in the Title VII area with Judge Alito, and there were cases in which we agreed and cases where we disagreed. There was one in particular, the Piscataway case, which was, for lack of a better term, a reverse discrimination case that became an en banc matter, where I and a number of my colleagues wound up writing dissenting opinions. But that was a very close and I think very closely contested case having to do with whether or not Title VII contemplated diversity as an interest that an employer could use. And to my disagreement and chagrin, the majority did not agree with Judge Sloviter, Judge McKee, and myself in that case. But I never felt that Judge Alito or any of my colleagues who were in the majority in that case were in any sense hostile to civil rights interests. This was a legal question, and they came out the way that they did. In other cases, for example, the Aman v. Cort Furniture case, which I authored, Judge Alito was not on the panel, but as I think Judge Gibbons mentioned, all opinions are circulated on the Third Circuit, and so really any opinion that comes out is the opinion of the court. I don’t believe in that case, which was another Title VII case that I think furthered the law in some very important re-

671
spects, defining code words as—racial code words as actionable under Title VII, I believe that Judge Alito went along with that. I was very happy that he did that. And there were others.
My sense of civil rights matters and how a court should approach them jurisprudentially might be a little different. I believe in being a little more aggressive in these areas, but I cannot argue with a more restrained approach. As long as my argument is going to be heard and respected, I know that I have a chance, and I believe that Sam Alito will be the type of Justice who will listen with an open mind and will not have any agenda-driven or result-oriented approach.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Scirica, would you reply as briefly as you can as to the question I posed?
Judge SCIRICA. In my 15 years with Sam Alito, I have never seen any indication that he would favor that particular interest.
Chairman SPECTER. Judge Aldisert? Judge ALDISERT. Well, I approach it from a rather personal standpoint. Judge Alito is an American of Italian origin, and until quite recently, Americans of Italian origin were subject to a lot of discrimination. Quotas as to whether to get into professional schools. A little example in my particular case, when you consider all the Americans of Italian origin, from New England, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, along the seaboard, there had never been an American of Italian origin or these millions of Americans of Italian origin—there had never been an American of Italian origin ever appointed to the United States Court of Appeals until President Johnson appointed me in 1968. So I can speak from experience. Things are better now, but I have lived through that. When you look at Judge Alito, his father came to the United States as an Italian immigrant at a very early age, and I am certain that the idea of protecting the rights of the so-called little guy is in the genes of Samuel A. Alito, Jr. Chairman SPECTER. Judge Gibbons, as briefly as you can. Judge GIBBONS. His attitude toward criminal defendants is of some significance for our law firm because we have a very big white-collar criminal defense practice, and my partner, Larry Lustberg, prepared a memo on the subject. He says, although given his prosecutorial background, Judge Alito has been seen by many of the defense bar as pro-government. A thorough review of his record shows that, in fact, he is a fair-minded jurist who pays careful attention to the record below and who takes great pains to apply precedent. Now, he then goes on in the memo to review the series of cases in which Judge Alito decided against the government on many significant issues, and he concludes, while, like most appellate judges, there are far more decisions affirming than reversing convictions— that is certainly true of every judge who has sat on the court of appeals—Judge Alito’s jurisprudence is properly characterized as careful, based on precedent, and particularly attentive to the record. If that record does not support affirmance, he reverses. He also included an admonition to the rest of the department that you had better know the record, because he will. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Judge Gibbons.

Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to thank you very much for being here. I think the testimony was very interesting. I listened acutely. I think we would all be very lucky if any one of us had colleagues like you that would come forward and say the things that you all have said. Let me ask this question. How do you look at the evaluations that have been done, those evaluations that say, well, in the cases looked at, he has judged whatever percent it was, but let us say it is 70 percent—I am just making it up—in favor of corporations, or business, or against the little man. How do you look at that sample and how do you regard that? It has been written about rather extensively, anyone that would like to try to answer it. Judge Becker? Judge ALDISERT. I would like to try that— Senator FEINSTEIN. Give it to Judge Becker because I have known him longer. Judge BECKER. Senator Feinstein, first of all, you have to keep in mind, and I think this is a national—this statistic applies nationwide—I think somewhere between 80 and 85 percent of cases are affirmed. So a lot of this is going to determine who won in the district court or who won in the agency. So those numbers are skewed by that very fact. The only other thing I would say is I haven’t analyzed these statistics but that is nothing I have ever seen. He has voted with me. There was a case not long ago, it was a very thin employment discrimination case in which a woman, well, she never got to a jury in district court. One of my colleagues wanted to affirm. I was on the fence. And Sam wanted to reverse. I said, OK, write it up, and we went along. I have just never seen any evidence that he is for the big guy against the little guy. But I think if you analyze these, I think you will find most of the statistics come from the fact that the big guy won in the district court and 80 to 85 percent of those cases are affirmed, and most of those, they win out. Senator FEINSTEIN. Judge? Judge ALDISERT. I was just about to say the same thing, but my good friend, Judge Becker, your figure was a little skewed there. The percentage of reversals is not 15 percent, it is 8.7 percent, the statistics last year of all cases. In criminal cases, in the figures of 2004, the reversal rate in criminal cases was 5.1 percent. Judge BECKER. I always defer to a master arbiter. Judge BARRY. And, of course, it should be added that when we are considering cases on appeal, we are operating on a standard of review. So we are not typically looking at the issues underlying that review. Senator FEINSTEIN. The underlying situation, right. Judge BARRY. That is right. We are looking at an abuse of discretion standard. We are looking at, were the facts clearly erroneous? So we are not starting from scratch, typically. Senator FEINSTEIN. Let me ask you this question. The subject of abortion and Roe was raised, and obviously if you have listened to the hearings, you have heard the question going on back and forth. I was very puzzled when I read Chief Justice Roberts’s statement

before us on Roe and how he answered Senator Specter’s questions. The Chief ended up by saying that he felt that Roe was well-settled law. I think he even added to that, very well-settled law.
Chairman SPECTER. He said settled beyond that. Senator FEINSTEIN. All right, settled beyond that. And I asked Judge Alito, and I thought at the very least he was going to agree with Justice Roberts, and he said, well, it all depends upon what settled means. What do you make of that? Judge BARRY. I respectfully cannot characterize what Judge Alito meant by that and I would much prefer not to have to try. Senator FEINSTEIN. That is fine. Anybody? Judge BECKER. I think we are here as fact witnesses more than opinion witnesses, Senator Feinstein. I really would not answer that question. Senator FEINSTEIN. Very good. Judge BECKER. I couldn’t make a judgment on it. Senator FEINSTEIN. Very good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. I want to express my gratitude to all of you judges, you out there in the West, Judge Garth, for coming here today and helping this Committee. It is pretty apparent that I got quite emotional when my old friend, Judge Aldisert, testified. I really did. I got emotional because I care for you and I watched you for years there and just have a tremendous amount of respect. I have read your books, and you have always sent them to me, and that has meant a lot to me. But you all mean a lot to me. It is no secret that, with very few exceptions, I love the Federal courts and I love the judges, and there are very few exceptions. There are a few that I think you can name yourselves. [Laughter.] Senator HATCH. But by and large, you know, we pass unconstitutional legislation up here all the time and— [Laughter.] Senator HATCH.—if it hadn’t been for the courts, we would probably not have preserved the Constitution. So I want to give you all credit for that. But let me just say this. By the way, just to correct the record. What Judge, now Chief Justice Roberts, he and Judge Alito basically said the same thing. They said, well, it is settled as a precedent of the Court, with regard to Roe v. Wade. That is exactly what he said, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. That is basically what Judge Alito said. And Roberts said, and it is settled as a precedent of the Court, yes. Senator Specter asked him some more and then he said, ‘‘I think the initial question for a judge confronting an issue in this area, you don’t go straight to the Roe decision. You begin with Casey, which modified the Roe framework and reaffirmed its central holding.’’ So these are maybe touchy words, but it is important to get it right. One of the most prominent issues in this hearing has been how Judge Alito views the role of precedent in deciding cases. Too often, I think, the objective seems not so much to get insight into Judge Alito’s general views about precedent, but clues about how he will treat particular precedents.

674
First, let me make this point about Judge Alito’s record regarding circuit precedent. As I understand it, the appeals court can reconsider its own precedents only when all Third Circuit judges sit together en banc, is that correct?
Judge BECKER. That is correct. Senator HATCH. OK. It is my understanding that in his 15 years on the Third Circuit, Judge Alito has participated in 38 en banc decisions. Now, Judge Alito voted to overturn circuit precedent in just four of those cases. Two of those decisions were unanimous. All judges agreed. That does not look to me like someone who plays fast and loose with precedent. Let me just ask you, Judge Becker, and if anybody disagrees with what Judge Becker says, I will be happy to have you respond. Let me ask you a question about Judge Alito’s handling of certain—and the reason I ask Judge Becker, Judge Becker, as Senator Specter said, is the 101st Senator. He came down here and tried to help this asbestos problem and we all respect him for that. Let me just say, I know you have participated in more than 1,000 cases, or decisions, rather, with Judge Alito. All of you, of course, can offer your thoughts, as well. Yesterday, during the hearing, one of my Democratic colleagues held up some charts with some quotes from a few cases in which Judge Alito’s colleagues criticized how he applied circuit precedent. The picture that was painted was that Judge Alito misapplies precedent when it suits him, suggesting, I suppose, that he might be activist or careless in this regard on the Supreme Court. Now, I certainly agree that the views of his fellow judges are particularly relevant on this point and having you here is very valuable to us for that reason. Now, asking you all about this here seems more useful than a few selective sentence fragments on a chart. Realizing, Judge Becker, that judges do not always agree on every single point every single time, how would you characterize Judge Alito’s overall view or approach to precedent? Judge BECKER. Respectful of it. I have never seen what was portrayed, where— Senator HATCH. Judge, here— Judge BECKER.—I mean, Judge Alito might have disagreed with prior precedent. He followed it unless he felt that it was dicta, in which case it wouldn’t be precedent— Senator HATCH. Right. Judge BECKER.—or the case was distinguishable. But I have never seen him ignore or disregard precedent. Senator HATCH. Have any of the rest of you seen that? Judge SCIRICA. No. Senator HATCH. Judge Aldisert? Judge ALDISERT. Judge Hatch—Senator Hatch— [Laughter.] Judge ALDISERT. I wanted to answer Senator Feinstein the same way. In my book, ‘‘The Judicial Process, Text Materials and Cases,’’ Second Edition, 1996, I have an entire chapter on precedent, and one of those sections is called, ‘‘Viability of Precedent, or When Do You Depart.’’ and there is a sophisticated body of law, and I cite cases with Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, Thurgood Marshall, and a few others, and there are also some very important scholarly aca-

675
demic articles on it. I think that Judge Alito’s expression that it depends is a statement that you have to consider all the factors on all the Supreme Court cases that discuss when do we depart from precedent, and there is a body of law that is in my casebook.
Senator HATCH. Thank you so much, and Mr. Chairman, I want to thank all of these great judges for being here and I want to thank you, Judge Lewis, for taking time to be here in particular. We just really respect you. I love and respect the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I realize we have some retired and very distinguished retired judges, but some current judges. Insofar as the current judges, if their case is appealed to the Supreme Court and Judge Alito becomes a member of the Supreme Court, he will have to rule on their appeal, appeals from their decisions, and so I think rather than create a difficulty for them or for Judge Alito, if he is confirmed, I think I will not avail myself to ask questions of this unprecedented panel. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. Senator Kyl? Senator KYL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a question, and I think, Judge Lewis, it was a comment that you made that raised this question in my mind. There was a point made about the circulation of opinions among all of the judges on the court. When a three-judge panel has tentatively made a decision in a case and circulates an opinion, is that opinion circulated among all of the judges and then do all of the judges have an opportunity to comment on that in some way? Judge LEWIS. Yes, that is correct, and that is why the opinion is the opinion of the entire court in the end, when it is released. I should let Chief Judge Scirica address the current practice. I have been off the court for some time, but I assume it is done the same way, is it not? Senator KYL. This is interesting to me, because I practiced before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and that same opportunity, I think, is not as available. Judge GIBBONS. Senator, that was invented by Judge Biggs in the late 1930s. Senator KYL. In which—in the Third Circuit, sir? Judge SCIRICA. The Third Circuit. We circulate all of our precedential opinions to the entire court before they are ever published. That is, before the litigants and before the public sees them. We do not do that with a category that we call not precedential opinions. They are handled by the panel themselves unless there is a dissent, in which case we circulate them, as well. Now, of course, when a litigant loses a case, that litigant has the opportunity to file a petition for rehearing and that goes to the entire court because the litigant usually asks both for a panel rehearing before the original panel and also before the entire court. And so for precedential opinions, it gets sent to the court on two different occasions, one before it is ever published and one after it is published.

676
Senator KYL. I am curious, what happens if there is a strong opinion by one of the judges on the court who did not sit on the original three-judge panel that is different from the conclusion?
Judge SCIRICA. Any judge on our court on the initial circulation or even on the circulation for the petition for rehearing may write to the entire court or may write to the opinion writer or may write to the panel expressing his or her disagreement. It is one of the wonderful things about an appellate court, because we view the panel decisions that are precedential as opinions of the court more than just the opinion of the panel or the opinion of the author of the case. There is often this wonderful dialog that goes back and forth between the opinion writer or the panel and a judge who may have concerns about what is being decided, and it sometimes can go on for days. Sometimes, the panel will, or the author will say, ‘‘I want to think about this. I want to have the opportunity to revisit this issue.’’ And sometimes it takes weeks before the panel comes back with a new opinion, often a revised opinion. This is part of the collegial aspect of the court.
Senator KYL. This should be very reassuring to the litigants— Judge BARRY. And sometimes we will go en banc before the opinion ever issues. Judge BECKER. Or often, the panel will change its mind and say, we got it wrong. Senator KYL. Well, it is very interesting and I appreciated the opportunity to at least mention that. And then I, too, want to thank all of you for your willingness to be here, to take time out, but most especially to speak on behalf of a colleague who I know you all admire a great deal, and I thank you for that very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kyl. Senator Durbin. Senator DURBIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the members of the panel for their public service. I have no questions, and I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Leahy. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Durbin. Senator DeWine. Senator DEWINE. I have no questions, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Sessions. Senator SESSIONS. I would just like to ask the panel, I see one of the articles that stirred up some of this discussion about not being an even-handed judge actually only considered 221 cases in the judge’s first 6 years on the bench. I am sure you, as professionals who have been there, your judgment is better about his style and fairness than some abstract numbers would be. But I will just ask you, Judge Scirica, maybe—and if others would like to comment, please do—on civil rights cases that I have seen here, of the civil rights cases Judge Alito wrote, the panel agreed with him 90 percent of the time and his opinions were unanimous 90 percent of the time. That doesn’t sound like an extreme position to me. What would you say about that? Judge SCIRICA. Well, I would agree, and that would comport with my recollection of these cases.

Senator SESSIONS. And I notice the respect Judge Lewis had for Judge Alito. It said when he sat on panels where both the other judges were Democratic appointees, the decision was unanimous in 100 percent of the cases, or whatever those statistics show. And then with regard to the immigration cases, it says that his appeals—the average judge in the country—in average cases, the immigrant wins asylum claims in the court of appeals slightly over 11 percent of the time. But in Judge Alito’s record, he ruled for the immigrant seeking asylum in fully 18 percent of the cases.
Do those numbers, Judge Scirica, strike you as sort of what the— well, the 11 percent, is that about what you would expect?
Judge SCIRICA. Yes, sir. Senator SESSIONS. And in the cases that he wrote opinions on, the average court of appeals judge ruled for the immigrants 8 percent and he ruled for the immigrants 19 percent. Well, I don’t know that those numbers mean a whole lot, but I do think they tend to rebut some of the numbers that we have seen floating around, because your opinion of him does not reflect a person who shows bias. In the Rybar case, Judge Gibbons—you no longer are on the bench, you could be honest with us right here in Congress—if the Congress had put in an interstate commerce nexus in the statute they passed about machine guns, like they did in ITSMV, interstate transportation of stolen motor vehicles, or interstate transportation of stolen property, kidnapping, or theft from interstate shipment, it would have been upheld, wouldn’t it? Judge GIBBONS. That is what he said in his dissenting opinion. Senator SESSIONS. So the truth is that Congress missed the boat? Judge GIBBONS. Yes, as it did with respect to this recent unfortunate legislation. Senator SESSIONS. And we could fix it as soon as we passed a law correctly, I would submit. I would just ask this, Judge Aldisert. I am serious about this question, but I think Judge Roberts agreed with me that if an individual within the heart of Pennsylvania or New Jersey picks up a rock and kills another person, that is not a Federal crime. Is that correct, without an interstate nexus of some kind, that would be prosecutable solely by the State court? Judge BECKER. Unless he stole the rock out of an interstate shipment. Judge LEWIS. It could be a violation of Federal civil rights, also. Judge GARTH. If he killed or the person that he assaulted was a Federal official—the President or Vice President or a Senator. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. Well, Judge Lewis said it could be a civil rights violation if it was in a way to deny someone of civil rights. Judge LEWIS. That is correct. Senator SESSIONS. Or if it was a Federal official. But, classically, the Federal criminal law has been tied to interstate commerce nexus, hasn’t it, Judge Aldisert? Judge ALDISERT. Yes. Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Sessions. Senator Cornyn. Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I feel like I need to say ‘‘may it please the Court.’’ Thank you all for being here. It is very important, I believe, to have testimony from people that know this nominee. We have heard a lot of wild and crazy, from my perspective, accusations that have been unsubstantiated from people who don’t know this nominee as well as you do.
I want to just try to eliminate one concern that has been expressed, and I have heard a hint of criticism about these judges appearing as witnesses in this hearing, supposing that perhaps there would be some conflict of interest if your decisions would be appealed to the United States Supreme Court and Justice Alito had to sit on it. I haven’t noticed any lack of willingness to disagree with him while you were colleagues on the Third Circuit. That seems highly unlikely.
And for the suggestion that this is somehow unprecedented to have judges, former and current sitting judges testify, Mr. Chairman, I have a list of examples where sitting members of the Federal judiciary have testified during the confirmation proceedings of another Federal judge. And I would ask that that be made a part of the record.
Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, it will be made a part of the record.
Senator CORNYN. Canon 4B of the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges provides a judge may appear at a public hearing before a legislative body—there are some ellipses there—on matters concerning the law, the legal system and the administration of justice to the extent it would generally be perceived that a judge’s judicial experience provides special expertise in the area.
And I regret, Your Honors, that you somehow get sucked into the contentiousness and some of the unfairness that occurs sometimes, the innuendo that sometimes arises when you are a witness in a contested proceeding. And as you can tell, these hearings have become, and the confirmation process, an adversarial process.
The unfortunate part is, as our Chairman has noted before, it is not controlled by the rules of evidence. It could be based on speculation, hearsay and rumor, whereas we know in a court of law that wouldn’t be admissible. And our procedures are a lot more flexible and open-ended, and certainly there is no standard of review that applies to judges in your distinguished and exalted position as members of the Federal judiciary.
Judge Aldisert, I want to say that I guess I am the only other member of this Committee who has probably read one of your books, but I am certainly familiar with your great work and your writings. And, of course, as has already been noted, Judge Becker is very familiar to the Judiciary Committee.
I want to ask both Judge Gibbons, who is no longer on the bench, and Judge Becker—both of you have talked about the transforming experience of crossing over from being an ordinary lawyer, including a U.S. Attorney, and then putting on the black robe, after you have put your hand on the Bible and taken an oath to uphold the laws and Constitution of the United States, so help me God, and what a different perspective that provides, a different obligation, different responsibilities. And I think Judge Trump Barry noticed

that transformation in this nominee when he crossed over from being a practicing lawyer to becoming a member of the judiciary.
Judge Becker, I wonder if you just might comment. We just have a couple of seconds here, but this morning Senator Biden was asking questions about this nominee’s views on Roe v. Wade, perhaps as reflected in an application he made for a job in 1985. And it seemed to raise the question of, well, if that is your view today, wouldn’t you just feel free to go in and vote to overrule it?
And it struck me because of the difference in a judge’s role from that of an advocate. He was applying for a job as part of the Reagan administration. But on one hand, he was talking about, well, maybe you have the power, but what Judge Alito seemed to talk about most was legitimacy of the judicial process and the judgments rendered by courts and why that is such an integral part of the role judges play in our system of government.
Would you please respond to that? Judge BECKER. Well, I agree with Judge Alito and I think, Senator Cornyn, that you have eloquently described the transforming experience. I know that it is within your life’s experience when you took the oath of office to be a justice of the Texas Supreme Court. It just transforms you. You become a different person and your obligation is to the rule of law and you have no interest in a case. And if I could just seguey this into your original point which bears upon what Senator Leahy had to say in terms of whether or not a Justice of the Supreme Court would have to recuse on an opinion I wrote on one of our cases, I have no interest in the case. Recusal is a function of whether or not the party or the lawyer has an interest in the case, but I don’t have any interest in any case. None of us have any interest in any case, and this is consistent with what Judge Alito said and your description of that transforming experience. Senator CORNYN. Mr. Chairman, I would just say Judge Gibbons and Judge Lewis are no longer members of the bench and I am sure have experienced the liberating transformation once you cross back over that Rubicon, perhaps, as well. Thank you very much. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Cornyn. Senator Coburn. Senator COBURN. Thank you very much, and I appreciate so much you all taking the time to come here. As a physician, I am starting to learn some of the lingo of the legal profession. It is hard, but I am going to start talking in doctor’s terms so the rest of them can’t understand. Judge Barry, I wanted to ask you, and also Judge Lewis, do you think that there is any merit whatsoever to the allegations that were made that Judge Alito is hostile to the rights of women or minorities, and have you seen that in the 30 years—have you seen any indication whatsoever either in his opinions, his personal life, his interpersonal relations with you, or you, Judge Lewis, that there is any indication that there is that type of bias in this man? Judge BARRY. I have never seen it, and if I had seen it, I would not be here today. Senator COBURN. Judge Lewis?

Judge LEWIS. I have already said that if I sensed that Sam Alito during the time that I served with him or since then was hostile to civil rights or would be hostile to civil rights as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, I absolutely would not be here today. I am not interested in saying anything on behalf of someone that I believe would hold views like that or would proceed in that way.
I am basing what I am saying on my years of experience in conference with him, discussing cases and—we have different views and different approaches, but never would I suggest—did it seem to me that he held any hostility to civil rights, which is an area that I hold very dear and is very important to me and remain committed to furthering in this country.
Senator COBURN. Thank you. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don’t think you can have a better recommendation than the people that you work with and the people that you spend the greatest amount of time with and the people who see you under stress who make evaluations.
The greatest tragedy, I think, of this hearing is the allegations that have been made that aren’t substantiated based on fact, that are substantiated on the basis of the fact that you want to try to destroy somebody’s character and undermine their character to make them look a certain way which they are not.
I appreciate you all’s very straightforward answer and I thank you for coming, and I yield back my time.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. The question has been raised as to precedents, and Senator Cornyn has addressed that and it is worth mentioning just a few. Former Chief Justice Burger testified for Judge Bork. District Judge Craig testified for Chief Justice Rehnquist. District Judge Tanner testified for Justice Thomas. The canons, specifically 4B, of the conduct of U.S. judges make a specific allowance for this kind of a situation, quote, ‘‘judicial experience provides special expertise to the area.’’ And it is certainly obvious that the insights which you judges have to Judge Alito’s background are unique. When you talk about what goes on in those conferences, you are the only ones who are there and you have much more insight as to the opinions he has written that you have worked with him on. We have 30 witnesses who are coming in and that has been a traditional part of the process, but I know of no situation where witnesses have more to say which is relevant and weighty. Perhaps weight is the best evidentiary characterization of what you have had to say. A lot of things can be relevant, but especially where you have the issue which has been before this Committee as to Judge Alito’s agenda or Judge Alito’s approach or Judge Alito’s personal views dominating his judicial determinations, this panel is right on the head. It has been an unusual panel, but that is really not a strike against the practice. It may be a precedent for the future and it, I think, will be a good precedent. But whenever you try something new, there are differing voices, but I think it is an extraordinary contribution which this panel has made to this process.

So, former Chief Judge Becker, Chief Judge Scirica, Judge Barry, Judge Aldisert, Judge Gibbons, Judge Lewis, Judge Garth from Phoenix, Arizona, you lucky fellow, we thank you all very much for coming in.
We are going to take only a 10-minute break now. I didn’t have a chance to discuss it with Senator Leahy, but we do not have the situation where Judge Alito is on the stand and he needs a little longer break. We will have fresh witnesses and tired Senators.
Ten minutes. We will resume at 5:20. [Recess from 5:10 p.m. to 5:20 p.m.] Chairman SPECTER. We will now proceed with panel three, and our first witness is Edna Axelrod, who has known Judge Alito for nearly 20 years, having worked with him when he was United States Attorney. She is a sole practitioner in South Orange, New Jersey. She served in the U.S. Attorney’s Office from 1980 to 1983 and 1985 to 1994 during Judge Alito’s tenure as U.S. Attorney. She had an important position as the Chief of the Appeals Division. She is a graduate of Duke’s Law School, has a master’s degree in Law from Temple, and we welcome you here, Ms. Axelrod. We are going to have to be mindful of the time because we have four panels and about 23 witnesses. Senator LEAHY. Are you going to finish tonight? Chairman SPECTER. Well, I would like to, but it is subject to negotiation with you, Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, could I just ask unanimous consent that a number of letters I have and usual things to put in the record? Chairman SPECTER. Sure. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Thank you, Ms. Axelrod, for being here, and we are starting the clock at 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF EDNA BALL AXELROD, ATTORNEY AT LAW, LAW OFFICES OF EDNA BALL AXELROD, SOUTH ORANGE, NEW JERSEY
Ms. AXELROD. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to appear here today to testify in support of the nomination of Samuel Alito. I am a former Chief of the Appeals Division at the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, and for the past 11 years I have practiced as a Federal criminal defense attorney in northern New Jersey. At this point in these proceedings, I am sure there is little need to provide further comment concerning Judge Alito’s legal acumen and outstanding accomplishments. However, I hope that the Committee may find it useful to hear the insights and observations of someone who worked closely with Judge Alito during the period of time that he served as United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.
I first met Judge Alito when I joined the United States Attorney’s Office in 1980. At that time, he was laboring in the Appeals Division, and I was in the Frauds Division. As a rookie, I quickly learned that if I ran into a particularly thorny legal or procedural problem, the most knowledgeable and approachable person to consult was Sam Alito. Although he soon left for the Solicitor Gen-

682
eral’s Office, he returned in 1987 as United States Attorney. Shortly after his arrival, he began selecting the supervisory staff who would assist him during his tenure, and after reviewing my work in the Appeals Division, he asked me to serve as Chief of Appeals. This was particularly meaningful to me for two reasons: First, Judge Alito’s estimable reputation as an appellate and Supreme Court advocate had preceded him, and the importance that he placed on the appellate process was well known. Second, in 1987, it was still unusual for women to be elevated to positions of authority in either Government or private offices, and I was gratified to see Judge Alito’s appointments were based on merit, not gender.
As a member of the supervisor staff, I met frequently with Judge Alito, sometimes alone but usually with other division chiefs, to discuss ongoing significant criminal prosecutions, appeals, and investigative initiatives. During these meetings he openly invited the thoughts and input of everyone, asking subtle questions to guide the discussion to areas where he had concerns. Although it was clear that in the end he would make up his own mind, it was equally clear that there was no danger in advocating a position that he might ultimately reject. His goal was to get as much information as possible so his decisions could be firmly grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the law and the facts.
Consistent with this approach, his stewardship of the office was grounded in quiet confidence; his decisions and actions were measured and thoughtful—never impulsive or purely reactive. Although it is possible for U.S. Attorneys to use their offices as showcases for themselves and their further aspirations, that is, to enjoy and employ the limelight, this was never Judge Alito’s way. It was always the work, not the image, that came first.
It is a well-known motto of Federal prosecutors—one most often heard on those occasions when they suffer a defeat—that ‘‘the United States wins when justice is done.’’ Under the leadership of Samuel Alito—and I should say ‘‘Judge Alito’’—that was more than a catch-phrase. It was office policy. Judge Alito expected the assistants in his office to work hard to achieve and preserve convictions where the evidence supported guilt, but he also demanded that they remain ever mindful of the very great power that they wielded as Federal prosecutors and the need to use that power with appropriate discretion. Based on my experience in that office, I am confident that Judge Alito would approach the power of being on the Supreme Court with an equal if not heightened sense of responsibility and care.
As I noted earlier, I am present a criminal defense attorney, and I am also a lifelong Democrat. As such, I might be expected to have concerns about Judge Alito’s nomination. However, in supporting his nomination, I am actually representative of a large number of former colleagues of Judge Alito of all political stripes who support his nomination because they know firsthand what kind of man he is. Those of us who know him know that he is not an ideologue and that he does not use his position to pursue personal agendas. We have seen his profound respect for the law and precedent and his unfailing respect for all participants in the criminal justice system, prosecutor, defense counsel, and defendants alike. We know him to be a man of unquestionable ability and integrity, one who ap-

proaches each case in an open-minded way, seeking to apply the law fairly.
The appointment of Sandra Day O’Connor to the Supreme Court in 1981 was an event of special importance to me. At the time I thought that the most significant fact was that she was a woman, the first woman on the Court, and, of course, that was truly ground-breaking. But in time I have come to appreciate that, more than her gender, it is her extraordinary mixture of character and intellect that has most profited our country. As a person of both great character and great intellect, Samuel Alito would be a worthy successor to Justice O’Connor, and I hope that he will be speedily confirmed.
Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Axelrod appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Ms. Axelrod. Our next witness is Professor Michael Gerhardt, distinguished professor of constitutional law at North Carolina School of Law. Professor Gerhardt is the author of a number of books on constitutional law, served as special consultant to the White House on the nomination of Justice Stephen Breyer. He received his bachelor’s degree from Yale in 1978, master’s from the London School of Economics, and law degree from the University of Chicago in 1982. Thank you for joining us, Professor Gerhardt, and the floor is yours for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF MICHAEL J. GERHARDT, SAMUEL ASHE DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL LAW SCHOOL, CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINA
Mr. GERHARDT. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, and other distinguished members of the Committee.
For almost 20 years, I have had the honor of teaching constitutional law. For almost as long, I have studied the process of Supreme Court selection in some detail and have had the privilege and opportunity to write about it at some length. And I come to you today with the hope that whatever expertise I have developed in that process may be of some use to you.
In this statement, I want to just make three brief observations as extensions of my written statement, which you already have.
First, the Constitution allows every Senator to make a decision about a Supreme Court nomination based on whatever factors he or she considers to be pertinent, including judicial philosophy. The Constitution, I believe, does not require absolute deference to a President when it comes to making Supreme Court nominations, nor, for that matter, does it require hostility. The Constitution allows you, I think, to do what you see fit. It allows you to engage in a robust dialog about the qualifications for service on the Supreme Court.
With that in mind, I just want to give you one brief example of what I am talking about what the Constitution allows just to illustrate, I think, the robustness of the process that we shouldn’t be ashamed of but, in fact, should be prepared to embrace.

684
Much has been said about the fact that Judge Alito has had the most judicial experience of any nomination made to the Supreme Court in almost 70 years, but nobody mentions who that other nominee was. The other nominee that preceded him was Benjamin Cardozo, and Cardozo, as we probably all know, was not President Hoover’s first choice. It wasn’t even President Hoover’s second choice. In fact, he was the choice of the Senate. And the Senators came to the President and said, in effect—in fact, members of this Committee came to the President and said, in effect, that this is the person we want, here are the criteria we think are important. President Hoover was not obliged in any way, shape, or form to accept that, but he did. And I simply make that observation to underscore the fact that there is an opportunity for exchange between the Presidency and the Senate with respect to a Supreme Court nomination, and we should be prepared and as open as possible in talking about the qualifications for service. And, again, if each of you believes to some extent judicial philosophy is appropriate, it is important to say so and to act accordingly.
Second, you know better than I the important function of this Committee as a gatekeeper. You are in the position, at least the initial position, of being able to sort of filter out the views and personnel you don’t want to see reflected on the Supreme Court, or you are in the position of determining what views and personnel you do want to have on the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is largely a function of choices made by the President and the Senate. The Senate and the President help to make the Supreme Court what it is. And I think that that dual partnership is something we ought to keep in mind because in making determinations and judgments about a Supreme Court nomination, the Senate has an extremely important role to play. And the more vigorously you perform that role, I think the more credit it does to you, and the more we can be assured that whatever choice gets made about the people that serve on the Court, we can have confidence that they can be there, that they can trust the—that they are worthy of the trust you have given them to exercise the awesome power of judicial review over the constitutionality of not just your actions, but the actions of other branches.
Third, I must confess—and I regret this—an error in my written statement. I discuss in this written statement the importance of assessing whether or not Judge Alito was a bottom-up or top-down judge. A bottom-up judge is somebody who decides incrementally, one at a time, and has a great deal of respect for precedent. A topdown judge is somebody who tends to infer principles directly from the Constitution and then impose them from the top down. And in the course of trying to figure out whether Judge Alito was bottomup or top-down, I made a mistake in not identifying Justice Harlan as one of the Justices he most admires. I just want to sort of correct that error. The reverence for Justice Harlan is almost universal. He is certainly one of the Justices I most admire.
But the admiration for Justice Harlan does raise a question, and the question is this: How, if at all, does Judge Alito’s reverence for Justice Harlan make him the same kind of judge or a different kind of judge than other Justices who also have admired Justice

685
Harlan, including Justice Kennedy and Justice Souter? Is he the same kind of judge as they are, or is he a different kind of judge?
Reverence for Justice Harlan is obviously pertinent, it is important, but it may only tell us so much. And I think it is useful and very important for you not to shy away from asking the tough questions. You have asked the tough questions. I think it does you credit. I think that is what this process is all about, and I am privileged to be a part of it.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Gerhardt appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Gerhardt. Our next witness is Commissioner Peter Kirsanow, U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Partner with the law firm of Benesch Friedlander. He is also on the board of directors of the Center for New Black Leadership, and on the advisory board for the National Center for Public Policy Research. His bachelor’s degree is from Cornell, law degree from Cleveland State with honors. Commissioner Kirsanow has reviewed Judge Alito’s civil rights record and will testify as to his conclusions in that area.
STATEMENT OF PETER N. KIRSANOW, U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS, AND PARTNER, BENESCH FRIEDLANDER COPLAN & ARONOFF, LLP, CLEVELAND, OHIO
Mr. KIRSANOW. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, members of the Committee.
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights was established pursuant to the 1957 Civil Rights Act, among other things, to act as a national clearinghouse for matters pertaining to discrimination and denials of equal protection. And in furtherance of the clearinghouse responsibility and with the help of my assistant, I have reviewed the civil rights cases in which Judge Alito has participated on the Third Circuit, as well as his record as an advocate before the Supreme Court in the context of prevailing civil rights jurisprudence.
Our examination reveals that Judge Alito’s approach to civil rights is consistent with the generally accepted textual interpretation of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, as well as governing precedent. His civil rights opinions evince appreciable degrees of judicial precision, modesty, restraint and discipline, and in short, his civil rights record is exemplary, legally sound, intellectually honest and with an appreciation and understanding of the historical bases undergirding our civil rights laws.
Our examination also reveals that several aspects of Judge Alito’s civil rights record have been mischaracterized, some of the criticisms misplaced. Just three brief examples.
First, some have contended that Judge Alito has a regressive or anti-civil rights view of affirmative action, one that is to the right of Justice O’Connor. This contention is based on three affirmative action cases in which Judge Alito participated on brief, while he was with the Solicitor General’s Office in the Reagan administration. These three cases are Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, and Firefighters v. Cleveland, all of which involved expansive racial preferences as remedies for discrimination. Notwithstanding the fact that positions espoused as

686
an advocate are poor proxies for interpretive doctrine, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Judge Alito would somehow restrict remedies currently available under United Steelworkers v. Weber, or Johnson v. Transportation Agency any more so than Justice O’Connor would.
Judge Alito essentially argued that rigid quotas are unlawful, and opposition to quotas and expansive racial preferences do not evince a hostility to affirmative action, let alone civil rights in general.
Second, some critics have said that Judge Alito’s decision or dissent in Bray v. Marriott is evidence of his supposed tendency to impose ‘‘almost impossible evidentiary burdens on Title VII plaintiffs.’’ But a review of Bray shows that Judge Alito’s dissent actually steadfastly adheres to Third Circuit precedent, and carefully applies the law to the facts, as the majority opinion seems to dilute the commonplace standard of proof in a Title VII case reducing or converting the burden of production on the part of a defendant into a burden of proof.
The third contention unsupported by our examination is that Judge Alito’s civil rights record is out of the mainstream. Judge Alito participated in 121 Third Circuit panels that decided cases that may be termed in the traditional sense civil rights cases. Now, one would expect that if someone were out of the mainstream, that by definition he would rarely agree with his colleagues on the Third Circuit, and moreover, you would expect that he would almost never agree with his Democratic colleagues and would vote overwhelmingly with his Republican colleagues. But an examination of Judge Alito’s extensive record on the Third Circuit shows that his co-panelists on civil rights cases actually agreed with his written opinions and votes 94 percent of the time, and that is whether or not those panelists were Republican or Democrat, and in fact, produced unanimous decisions 90 percent of the time. Moreover, judges appointed by Democratic Presidents actually agreed with Judge Alito’s civil rights positions at a slightly higher rate than his Republican colleagues by a margin of 96 percent to 92 percent. In fact, judges appointed by Democratic Presidents Johnson, Carter and Clinton agreed with Judge Alito’s civil rights position at the same or slightly higher rate than judges appointed by President Reagan or either President Bush.
Obviously, in order to fairly assess Judge Alito’s civil rights cases, you have to look at the actual facts and applicable law in each case, but it cannot be credibly stated that Judge Alito is hostile to civil rights, out of the mainstream, or extreme, without leveling the same charges against every other judge on the court, whether Republican or Democrat.
I respectfully submit that Judge Alito’s 24-year record on matters pertaining to civil rights demonstrates a firm and unwavering commitment to equal protection under the law, and he has a comprehensive and precise understanding of our civil rights laws that will make him an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kirsanow appears as a submission for the record.]

Our next witness is Professor Samuel Issacharoff, Reiss Professor of Constitutional Law at New York University School of Law, an author of several books focusing on voting rights and civil procedure. He had taught at the Texas Law School. Bachelor’s degree from Binghampton University in 1973 and law degree from Yale in 1983.
Thank you for joining us, Professor, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF SAMUEL ISSACHAROFF, REISS PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK
Mr. ISSACHAROFF. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, members of the Committee. I want to direct my remarks to the question of the reapportionment cases and the significance of the Court’s role in overseeing the basic fairness and integrity of our political process.
I raise this issue because the reapportionment cases stand for something beyond simply the doctrine of one person/one vote. They also stand for the role that the Court has to play in making sure that the political process does not turn in on itself and does not close out those who are not able to effectively marshal their votes, their power, their support under the rules that govern the political process.
It is significant because no Justice of the Supreme Court over the past 35 years has hesitated to assume the responsibility so well articulated by the Supreme Court in the famous Carolene Products footnote. Justice Stone, in 1938, on behalf of the Court, recognized a special need for exacting judicial review in the case of laws, and these were his words, ‘‘that restrict those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation.’’ The reapportionment cases of the 1960s, the cases that appear to have so deeply concerned Judge Alito as a young man, were the realization of the Carolene Products insight.
In the 40 years that have passed since the reapportionment cases, the Supreme Court has bravely entered into the political thicket. Sometimes the Court’s role is simply what appears to be routine, such as access to the ballot and the polling place, sometimes it is the truly extraordinary as with Bush v. Gore. The result of these interventions, although obviously not without controversy, is a political system that is more open and more participatory that at any time in our history.
It is difficult to imagine in this day and age any serious objection to the rights identified in these cases. In Reynolds v. Sims, for example, Chief Justice Warren wrote that ‘‘Full and effective participation by all citizens in State Government requires that each citizen have an equally effective voice in the election of members of his State legislature.’’
But it is also well to recall the facts presented in these cases. The willful failure to reapportion had transformed American legislative districts into grossly unrepresentative institutions in which voters of the growing cities and suburbs found themselves unable

to participate effectively in a political process controlled by rural minorities.
In Alabama, the site of Reynolds v. Sims, one county had 41 times as many representatives per person as another. That pattern was repeated across the country. In California, to pick just one, Los Angeles County had one State Senator, as did another county with one one-hundredth of its population.
While the basic principle of one person/one vote may now be so deeply embedded in our culture as to seemingly defy any controversy, its implementation was another matter, and I think that is what is significant about these cases. Those whose votes were discounted to the point of irrelevance were repeatedly frustrated by entrenched political power. The intervention of the Supreme Court was indispensable, indeed, it was the single most successful remedial effort by the Supreme Court in our history. It changed and made fundamentally more democratic the legislative process, and it made the legislative process one that was deserving of judicial deference.
When I teach these cases today to students, however, and even when I was a law student in the early 1980s, the idea of one person/one vote appears so elemental, so in keeping with the most rudimentary sense of democracy and legitimacy, that students cannot even fathom that a society, a democratic society could be organized on any other basis.
I do not know how a young college student in 1970 might have reacted, particularly when presented with the formidable writings of Alexander Bickel. Bickel captured well the tension between a commitment to popular sovereignty and the overriding commands of the Constitution, and it is well to remember that although we turn our attention here to the Court, it is obviously the Congress that is a significant and major institution expanding our democratic horizons, as with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Nonetheless, I would suggest that the fact that the reapportionment cases should appear on a job application in the 1980s is at least a curiosity. Perhaps it was through recounting of an intellectual path, but perhaps an indication of a continuing view that courts have no business in checking the abuses of political power. If it is the latter, it should be deeply troubling to this Committee and to the Senate, for the issue of the day is not the intellectual trajectory of a thoughtful college student, but the implications for the vital role the Supreme Court plays in our democratic life.
Critical issues in the organization of our democracy remain unsettled and are going to appear as they do before the Court. Our system of redistricting has run amuck, the competitive lifeblood drained by self-perpetuating insiders. This may prove to be the same sort of structural obstacle to democratic reform as had to be dislodged by reapportionment decisions of 40 years ago.
The answer may not be simple, but the role of the Court is absolutely critical. So too with campaign finance. So too with even the mechanics of our electoral system. In all of these areas there is reason to doubt that incumbent officials are able to fix the political process that elected them. As Justice Scalia has wisely cautioned, ‘‘the first instinct of political power is the retention of power.’’ While not without controversy or difficulty, our collective experi-

ence over the past 40 years confirms that the Nation is much the better for the robust attention of the Court to the health of our democracy.
I would suggest to this Committee and to the Senate that before confirming any nominee to the Supreme Court, the Senate of the United States should be able to conclude with confidence that regardless how a nominee may vote on any given case, he or she will assume the full responsibility of protecting the integrity of our democratic processes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Issacharoff appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Professor. Our next witness is Mr. Carter Phillips, one of the premier appellate lawyers in the country. He has handled some 47 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, some of those as Assistant to Former Solicitor General Rex Lee. He is a graduate of Northwestern School of Law, a clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger, and rated as one of the 100 best lawyers in America by the National Law Journal. At your hourly, Mr. Phillips, thank you for joining us, and how much does 5 minutes cost? Mr. PHILLIPS. Well, I will not answer that question, but I will tell you that the law firm has taken a hit today. [Laughter.]
STATEMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS, MANAGING PARTNER, SIDLEY AUSTIN, LLP, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
Oftentimes it strikes me that baseball metaphors tend to be used at these hearings, and it at least impresses me that perhaps a tennis metaphor is more appropriate at this point based on the testimony of Judge Alito in the last two and a half days and the extraordinary eloquent testimony of the Third Circuit judges in the last hour or so, it would strike me that we ought to be at the point of game, set and match, because it seems to me that there can be no serious question about either the qualifications on ability or ethics or any other standard that this Committee would want to use in reviewing the qualifications of Judge Alito to become a Supreme Court Justice.
You have my written testimony. I am not inclined to repeat it at this point. One thing I have learned as an appellate advocate is if you think you are ahead on points, you would do well to sit down and shut up. So all I am going to do is simply recount for you my own experiences with Judge Alito when we were in the Solicitor General’s Office, not because I think they add all of that much, but I do think they debunk the notion that somehow Judge Alito has long been an ideologue of any sort.
The judge and I met when we both interviewed with Judge McCree, who was Jimmy Carter’s, President Carter’s Solicitor General. We were interviewing for a job as Assistants of the Solicitor General. We had applied for that position prior to the election. Neither of us knew which direction that election was going to come

out. We were seeking that position not because we had any kind of an agenda to fill, but solely because each of us hoped to get a very prestigious position.
Now, as it happened in that first meeting, Judge Alito and I ended up being seated together by ourselves when all the other members of the Solicitor General’s Office went off to another table and we had what I think is fairly described as at least a little bit of an uncomfortable conversation because we had assumed that we were competing for exactly the same job and had a very interesting exchange of views about our backgrounds and our experiences, he being an existing Assistant U.S. Attorney with an extraordinary amount of experience as an appellate lawyer, I being a former law clerk and, at that time, an assistant professor of law. But we built a great friendship based on that conversation and the fact that we both ended up in the Solicitor General’s Office. Well, what struck me is that whether or not the Solicitor General had been Wade McCree or whether, as it turned out, the Solicitor General was Rex Lee, our service to the United States would have been precisely the same.
And the only thing I would say in that regard is that during the three-plus years that I have served with Judge Alito in that office, I had an opportunity to talk with him almost every day, and in that capacity, I learned an enormous amount from him about both his compassion and his intellect and his open-mindedness and his enthusiasm to assist all of the lawyers in that office. He was a great lawyer. He was a tremendous oral advocate. He went on, obviously, to a very distinguished career. While I have my own opinions on what he has accomplished on the Third Circuit, it seems to me I cannot add to the eloquence of what has already been said by the judges of that court and I would simply urge this Committee to confirm him as a Justice. Thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Phillips. [The prepared statement of Mr. Phillips appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Professor Goodwin Liu is an expert in constitutional law, civil rights, and the Supreme Court at the University of California, Boalt Hall. He is a graduate of Stanford with his bachelor’s degree, and master’s from Oxford and law degree from Yale Law School in 1998. He served as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg during the October 2000 term. Thank you for coming in today, Professor Liu, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF GOODWIN LIU, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF LAW, BOALT HALL SCHOOL OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY, BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA
Mr. LIU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very honored to be here today.
I agree with all of my fellow panelists that Samuel Alito has a very talented legal mind. I have read over 50 of his opinions. They are very sharp, analytical, intellectually honest. But if intellect alone were enough, then these hearings would be unnecessary. We care about the judicial philosophy of the nominee, and so to pre-

pare for these hearings, I studied Judge Alito’s opinions on individual rights versus government power.
His record is enormous, and Mr. Chairman, as you have said, cherry-picking cases is not very informative. Neither is it very informative to look at the entire run of all cases. What is informative, I think, is a look at the closest, most contested cases, cases where judges on a panel disagreed. These are the cases most like the ones at the Supreme Court. The law is less clear and judges have to show their stripes.
I don’t think Judge Alito is an ideologue, but I think it is important to see what the record says. So I looked at several areas where government wields great power: immigration, the Fourth Amendment, criminal prosecution. In these areas, Judge Alito sat on 52 panels that divided between the individual and the government. He voted for the individual only four times, three times joining an en banc majority, one time writing in dissent. In the other 48 cases, he sided with the government. This includes all 13 cases on the Fourth Amendment, all eight cases involving erroneous jury instructions, all four cases involving the death penalty. On 13 occasions, his vote for the government was a dissent from an opinion written or joined by a Republican colleague.
Most of the counter-examples cited in these hearings are not terribly illuminating. The constitutional violations are clear. The holdings were unanimous. In the contested cases, Judge Alito agreed with the government over 90 percent of the time, far more often than other appellate judges in similar cases, even those appointed by Republican Presidents.
Now, these figures are not dispositive. Every case is different, and I am sure Judge Alito got it right many times. But let me give three examples that show his instinct, I think, to defer to government power.
The first is a memo he wrote in 1984 as Assistant to the Solicitor General analyzing a case where police saw a burglary suspect running across the back yard. The suspect reached a fence and an officer called out, ‘‘Police, halt.’’ When the suspect tried to climb the fence, the officer shot him in the back of the head, killing him. The suspect, Edward Garner, was an eighth grader with a stolen purse and ten dollars on his body. He was not armed and the officer did not think he was. The sole reason for his killing was to prevent his escape.
Judge Alito’s memo, speaking for no one but himself, said, ‘‘I think the shooting can be justified as reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.’’ In a remarkable passage, he argued that using deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect rests on, and I quote, ‘‘the general principle that the state is justified in using whatever force is necessary to enforce its laws.’’ In 1985, the Supreme Court rejected this view.
Second, in a 2004 case, the FBI installed a secret video camera in a suspect’s hotel room. This was done without a warrant on the ground that the FBI turned on the camera only when the target allowed an undercover informant into the room. Judge Alito accepted this logic, even though the camera remained in the room day and night. The dissent called the surveillance Orwellian, limited only by the government’s self-imposed restraint. Judge Alito

seemed not to grasp that the concept of a warrant puts a judge between the citizen and the police precisely because our privacy is too precious to entrust to law enforcement alone. The NSA program of warrantless eavesdropping is also being defended by assurances of executive self-restraint.
Finally, in 1997, there was a capital case where two Reagan appointees, both former prosecutors, found a misleading jury instruction unconstitutional. Judge Alito said the instruction was ambiguous and inadvisable, but adequate to convict the defendant of first degree murder. He also said the court should not have heard the claim at all because defense lawyers did not argue it in prior appeals. But the State never raised this argument to the inmate’s claim. Judge Alito raised it himself. The court chided him for nearly crossing the line between a judge and an advocate.
Civil liberties are sometimes seen as obstacles to law enforcement. But as Justice Frankfurter once said, the safeguards of liberty are often forged in cases involving not very nice people.
Mr. Chairman, liberty is not safe in an America where police can shoot and kill an unarmed boy to stop him from escaping with a stolen purse, where judges occasionally aid prosecutions by raising arguments that the State itself did not raise, and where the FBI can install a camera where you sleep on the promise that they won’t turn it on unless they have to.
Mr. Chairman, this isn’t the America we know and it isn’t the America we aspire to be. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Professor Liu. [The prepared statement of Mr. Liu appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Mr. Phillips, how would you evaluate the comments Professor Liu has made? Mr. PHILLIPS. Well, with respect to the memorandum to the Solicitor General, I think the notion that that is an individual opinion is not a very apt description of at least what I viewed my role when I was an Assistant to the Solicitor General. What we did in that context, and in this particular case, what he was doing, was proposing that an amicus brief be filed on behalf of the United States in support of the State of Tennessee’s position. In that process, I mean, it may be that that sentence, and I don’t have the context of it to understand it completely, but at that stage, all he is doing is proposing that a brief be filed. It would be interesting to see what the ultimate brief said and whether or not it staked out a position quite as aggressive. But because that is part of the deliberative process that goes on, it is the same deliberative process that goes on with respect to the courts. I mean, I don’t disagree that it makes sense to look at the most contentious cases as a legitimate way to examine that, but again, I don’t think you can take—and I do think this is a classic instance of cherry-picking—I don’t think you can take out one or two specific examples and say this somehow reflects anything about the body of work of a judge who has been on the bench for 15 years and in the face of the testimony we just heard from colleagues of his who spent literally more than decades with him and whose view is that he comes to each case with an open mind and thoroughly analyzes each one and performs this in a bottom-up, not a top-down process.

693
Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Axelrod, you know Judge Alito extensively. How would you respond to Professor Liu’s testimony?
Ms. AXELROD. Well, I had the same reaction concerning the first case that was mentioned, when he was in a role as an advocate and was trying to come up with the different perspectives that you would bring to a case as an advocate for the government, where your job is to figure out whether or not you are going to be supporting the result below. He was doing his job and he was doing it appropriately.
And the other cases, I think you have to look at the cases more closely than you can in basically a soundbite during a few-minute presentation. You have to look at the arguments that were made on both sides. You have to look at what the standard of review was. You need to see the facts. I am sure that the professor analyzed these cases ably, but I would not be persuaded simply by a short summary of them that the reasoning was unfounded, even if I disagreed with it, which I very well might have, without seeing more.
Chairman SPECTER. Commissioner Kirsanow, what is your evaluation of Judge Alito’s record as it applies to civil rights issues with African-Americans?
Mr. KIRSANOW. Well, as I indicated before, it is exemplary. We took a look at several hundred cases, 121 specifically, and we drew a very broad net to encompass the broadest definition of civil rights possible, but we also drew a more narrow net for the more traditional civil rights cases, the Title VII cases where it is more likely that you are going to find an African-American plaintiff.
And what we saw there is, and I referred to Bray v. Marriott, I think it is emblematic of the kind of approach Judge Alito has. He is very precise. Earlier on, I heard testimony with respect to is he in favor of the little guy or the big guy, and I think I would hearken back to Judge Alito’s opening, where he says that no one is either above the law or below the law. I don’t think that he is outcome-driven. He is looking at upholding the law, whether or not that redounds to the benefit of the big guy or the little guy, and I think that is the classic example of someone who hues closely to the most profound protections of civil rights.
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Issacharoff, is there any doubt in your mind that Judge Alito will uphold the one man/one vote rule?
Mr. ISSACHAROFF. I don’t think there is any doubt that he would uphold one person/one vote as an abstract matter. I think that the broader question that is raised by his earlier comments, and I heard nothing in these hearings that really addressed this, is a deeper one about the role of the court in checking the abuses of incumbent power. So while I don’t in any way question that he has, as much as all the rest of us have, internalized the one person/one vote principle, my reservation would be on the willingness to use judicial power to check malfunctions in the political process.
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Gerhardt, you say that the Senate ought to be an active participant in the selection of Supreme Court Justices. To what extent do you think that, with a heavy campaign on the judicial issue, the President has latitude to pick judges as he wants on the political spectrum, and how could the Senate really effectuate your idea?

694
Mr. GERHARDT. I think the idea I am describing is the system that we have got. I don’t mean to suggest a different kind of system, Senator. The President may do exactly as you suggest, pick somebody based on whatever criteria he likes. I am just suggesting that I think it is perfectly consistent with the structure and history of our Constitution for Senators then to provide an independent judgment of his criteria and to assess them on whatever other criteria they think are appropriate.
Chairman SPECTER. The red light went on during your answer— Mr. GERHARDT. Sorry. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. I think he is referring to himself, Professor. Good to see you again. I just want to followup on Professor Issacharoff, and I was pleased to meet your son, Lucas, here earlier. That way, his name is in the transcript. Mr. ISSACHAROFF. Thank you, Senator. [Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. We have talked about the 1985 job application of then Sam Alito for a job in Ed Meese’s Justice Department. He stated he developed an interest in constitutional law motivated in large part—in large part—by disagreement with the Warren Court decisions, particularly in the area of reapportionment. Now, in the questions he was asked here, he retreated from that unqualified disagreement and said that it was based on certain details of later Warren Court decisions, like the 1969 case, Kirkpatrick v. Preisler. Mr. ISSACHAROFF. Yes. Senator LEAHY. Doesn’t it seem incredible that he was telling Mr. Meese in 1985 that in 1969, as a young college student, he was so incensed by the Kirkpatrick case, it motivated to study constitutional law? Mr. ISSACHAROFF. I think the Kirkpatrick case had some impact in the Alito household because of the particular role that his father played. But his statement refers to an intellectual excitement based on the writings of Professor Bickel of Yale. Professor Bickel was not concerned with the implementation of one person/one vote. Professor Bickel was concerned, as was Justice Harlan at the time, that the Court should have no business in this area whatsoever, that whatever the political process did, whatever the malfunctions of politics might be, the courts simply were not to be engaged in that process. That is the idea that was animating Professor Bickel, and one has to assume was animating the young Sam Alito. Senator LEAHY. And, of course, Justice Harlan was one of his heroes. Had we followed that idea of Harlan’s dissent, and others, we wouldn’t have had reapportionment around this country, would we? Mr. ISSACHAROFF. There were— Senator LEAHY. Unless reapportionment was done politically by those who would reapportion themselves out of office. Mr. ISSACHAROFF. The history of the United States was that for the 20th century, until we got these cases in the 1960s, incumbent officials simply did not reapportion. They had a constitutional duty, including this body, in the 1920s, the Congress, the Senate of the United States, decided not to reapportion. The Congress simply

695
said why should we reapportion ourselves out of business, we will just refuse, even though we have a constitutional obligation.
The lesson was that when power decides to close in on itself and pull the ladders up behind it, the courts have to be there. Professor Bickel was deeply disturbed by this, and when I read in 1985 that somebody is saying that, ‘‘That is what brought me to constitutional law.’’ it opens questions. I don’t have an answer, but certainly I do find it puzzling.
Senator LEAHY. Thank you. Professor Liu, listening to the two cases you described, the 10year-old boy shot in the back by an officer who didn’t believe he was armed, and in any event, he wasn’t coming at the officer, he was leaving, the TV in the hotel room, the bedroom, these things really bother me. And you now have the emerging story that the President may have violated—actually, the Congressional Research Service believes he has—and ordered others to violate the criminal provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by spying on Americans. Do you think from what you have seen here today that we should take great comfort that a potential Justice Alito would stand up to the President on those kind of issues? Mr. LIU. Well, Senator— Senator LEAHY. And I look at how deferential he has been to law enforcement, and I served in law enforcement, as did our Chairman. I have a very soft, warm part in my heart for law enforcement. The only thing in my personal office that has my name on it is my shield from when I was in law enforcement. But doesn’t this bother you? Mr. LIU. Well, Senator Leahy, it does, and I won’t venture any predictions as to how he would perform as a Justice. But I would say that what he urged the Committee to do was to believe that he would behave as a Justice as he has behaved as a Third Circuit judge. Let me say one thing about the memo. This memo that he wrote in 1984 is about 13, 14 pages long. The first 10 pages of the memorandum contain his own personal individual analysis of this case. I urge all members of the Committee to read it if only to discover that he uses the first person throughout the first 10 pages of the memo. Only in the last three pages does he discuss whether or not the United States Government should file an amicus brief on the side of the State of Tennessee. And what is ironic about the last three pages is that he observes that all Federal agencies prohibit precisely this kind of use of deadly force, and that is one of the reasons why he urged against amicus participation in this case, because the U.S. Government would be put into a difficult position to show that it really meant the rule that he would have urged. Senator LEAHY. Thank you, and, Professor Gerhardt, I am going to send you a letter. I had another question for you, but I found very instructive your quick history lesson, as I have when you have given longer ones. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize. I am going to have to leave at this point for a while, but I know you have everything under control. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Kyl?

696
Senator KYL. Mr. Chairman, let me just thank the witnesses for being here. I just am moved to make one comment, though. I cannot dispute the analysis of individual items here, but I think in law we are all familiar with the best evidence rule. And the best evidence of how Judge Alito would serve on the United States Supreme Court, it seems to me, is not something that might have motivated him to be interested in the law 30-some years ago or something that he even wrote as a young lawyer working in the administration but, rather, his 15 years on the bench, Number one and, second, how his colleagues have viewed his character as well as his judicial performance.
We have had almost 3 days to query him about all manner of issues, and I think to try to, to use the phrase, ‘‘cherrypick’’ a particular comment that was made in a much different kind of context and read into that something more powerful than all of the other best evidence that we have is a real stretch. I will just put it that way.
I, nonetheless, appreciate the effort that all of you have made to be here to enlighten us in these hearings, and I thank you for your testimony.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Kyl. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was reminded of an extraordinary observation the other day, and that was that Robert Bork and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed 91 percent of the time. It was the 9 percent when they differed which was the major difference. That is something that I think sometimes we lose track of here when we are looking at overall statistics, overall figures. It is the dissents. And it is the close dissents, as Professor Liu has pointed out they are really important on these enormously sensitive issues involving race, involving the disabled, involving women, that so much of a judge’s philosophy comes out. I am interested, Professor, just if you would talk a little bit about the jury selection cases. We have considered the two that Judge Alito was most involved in, one which is pretty boilerplate, I understand, the Brinson v. Vaughn case, and then the dramatic Riley v. Taylor case, which is just extraordinary and I think enormously distressful to many. I would be interested if you would just talk about both and give us your assessment. Mr. LIU. Sure. Well, Riley v. Taylor has been discussed in these hearings. That was a case that concerned a challenge to racial discrimination in jury selection in the Dover County court. It was shown that over the course of four murder trials within the same year, including the defendants in the case, the prosecution had struck every black potential juror to serve on a capital jury. And the case was originally decided, actually, with Judge Alito in the majority, but it was then en banc’d, and Judge Sloviter ended up with a majority opinion, basically finding that this pattern, in addition to other evidence in the record, showed racial discrimination in the jury. Judge Alito dissented from that view, and I think the sentence, I think, that is most disturbing is his comparison of that pattern to the right- or left-handedness of Presidents. And he went further
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00708 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.003 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

697
to say that, absent a careful multiple regression analysis—I can barely say it—we can’t infer from the statistical pattern any racial discrimination.
Now, the Brinson v. Vaughn case came along 3 or 4 years later. That was, I believe, a 2005 case in which there was a pattern of 13, I believe, out of 14 black jurors being struck. And Judge Alito wrote a unanimous opinion finding racial discrimination in that case.
What is interesting about that case is that he relies on a prior case of the Third Circuit called Holloway v. Horn, which relies in turn on Riley v. Taylor.
Senator KENNEDY. Could you, just in the very short time, in looking through the opinions in these dissents, in areas where Judge Alito took away the effect of a decision of a trial court to have a jury trial, the number of cases that he took away from the trial court, and the number of cases that he took after there had been a jury trial, on appeal where he ruled against the individual on that, effectively overriding or overruling the trial court, a number in both of those areas some rather significant cases. We haven’t got a lot of time here, but I think you get what I am driving at in terms of the respect for the trial court and the jury verdict, whether you feel from your own kind of analysis the appropriate kind of respect and tradition for that.
Mr. LIU. Well, I think one area in which there is, to my mind at least, a somewhat disconcerting pattern is in the Fourth Amendment context. You know, much has been said about, for example, the Doe v. Groody case. What I find puzzling about that case is it is not that there is nothing to Judge Alito’s position. I think if you read—
Senator KENNEDY. This is the strip searching of the child. Mr. LIU. That is right. His opinion actually is, like all of his opinions, incredibly well reasoned, very thoughtful. It is not at all disparaging to the girl or her mother, who was found to be illegally searched. What is interesting to me is that in that case, there is the availability of two competing interpretive principles. One is read the four corners of the warrant for what it says. The other is supplement the four corners of the warrant with underlying material that is questionable, at least, in terms of whether or not it is incorporated. Given the important dignity at interest in Doe v. Groody, it just strikes me as puzzling why he would have chosen the second interpretive device rather than the first. And the second one is the one that took the case out of the jury’s hands to determine whether or not the search was or was not reasonable. Senator KENNEDY. This is the one where Judge Chertoff took exception to Judge Alito. Thank you very much. My time is up. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Well, on the Doe case, Mr. Phillips, Doe v. Groody, this was a question involving a lawsuit—you, as a Solicitor General, you have had to defend law officers for personal damages, they are being sued. At best, there was an appearance, was it not,

that this affidavit was, in fact, made a part of the warrant because the magistrate judge intended it so and said it?
Mr. PHILLIPS. Senator Sessions, that, I mean, that is, at least in my mind, the complete answer to the Professor’s argument, which is this is not—this doesn’t have anything to do with two different analytical approaches. It has to do with how do you apply qualified immunity and what deference do you owe to the individual officer who is in a very precarious position, making decisions on the fly. I think if you read the opinion, it is quite, as he said, scholarly, thoughtful, analytical, almost apologetic with respect to the consequences to the individuals involved, but still recognizing at the end of the day that qualified immunity is designed to provide precisely the kind of gate-keeping function that the court exercised there in order to take those kinds of issues away from the jury because that is the only way you can protect the greater societal interests that are implicated.
Senator SESSIONS. So he did a search warrant on a house where dope dealers were there and he followed the instructions of the magistrate. They conducted a search of the young girl in a private chamber by a woman officer without removing all of her clothes, just pulling down her outer garments and a blouse up, apparently, and from the indications of the magistrate, that was permitted. And so the question was, was he acting within the line of scope of his employment and was this officer subject to personal suit for money damages, isn’t that correct?
Mr. PHILLIPS. That is absolutely right, Senator. Senator SESSIONS. Well, I am telling you, police officers have a hard enough time understanding these laws of search and seizure. They are very complicated, and the judges throw out searches all the time when they are not proper. But to sue the officer who is trying to do the right thing, I think Judge Chertoff was in error and I would like to see him back on here. I served as U.S. Attorney with him and I will ask him about that case. [Laughter.] Senator SESSIONS. I think Judge Alito was correct. Maybe he was not, but I think he had a good basis for that decision and I am concerned about it. Mr. Liu, with regard to the Kithcart case in your written opinion here, you quote a dissenting opinion from Judge McKee that said that—this is where you criticize Judge Alito for holding that there was not a basis for arresting a black individual who was in a black sports car after some armed robberies that occurred, and so that was the message apparently that went out, and the officers stopped a car and arrested this individual who was black in a black sports car, and the Judge said, that is not enough. That is basically racial profiling, and he left open, as I understand it, the question of whether or not the stop was legitimate. And this judge, correct me if I am wrong, and maybe some of you prosecutors would jump in, but Judge McKee you quote favorably here. He said, ‘‘Just as the record fails to establish that Officer Nelson had probable cause to arrest any black male who happened to drive by in a sports car, it also fails to establish reasonable suspicion to justify stopping any and all such cars that happen to contain a black male.’’

699
Now, isn’t that quite a difference of proof standard between the authority of an officer to arrest someone and the authority of an officer to do an investigative stop? Isn’t that clearly a different standard, and wasn’t Judge Alito correct to suggest that there is a different standard for the investigative stop than it is to arrest someone?
Mr. LIU. I think that is true, Senator Sessions. There is definitely a difference of standards. One is a reasonable suspicion standard. The other is a probable cause standard.
In this case, I want to be absolutely clear in my testimony. I am not criticizing Judge Alito for his result. I am saying he is correct, but Judge McKee is saying that he didn’t go far enough.
Senator SESSIONS. All right. But I— Mr. LIU. Judge McKee is dissenting to the other side of Judge Alito by saying that by the same logic that racial profiling prohibits the probable cause finding, it also prohibits the reasonable suspicion finding. Senator SESSIONS. In that, I think the law is clearly to the contrary. I think officers who have that kind of information can at least stop a vehicle. At least, there is certainly far more authority to do that than it is and the standards are different, pretty clearly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Sessions. Senator Biden? Senator BIDEN. Professor Gerhardt, I am just curious. Was that the case you cited about the Hoover administration, was that when Senator Boren went down and said to—it is a good answer, I think—to the Chairman—Senator Boren went down, and when he was given a list of ten people, he looked at the list of the President and he said, ‘‘It is a great list, Mr. President, but you have it upside down.’’ and that is how you get the message, because when Presidents actually consult, you do have an impact. Let me ask you, Professor Gerhardt, and I understand if you don’t want to answer it, but where do you think on the spectrum of the present Court, if Judge Alito is confirmed, he will end up? Mr. GERHARDT. It is— Senator BIDEN. I know that that is guessing, but what is your best judgment? Mr. GERHARDT. It is a great question, Senator, and obviously, I think it is one of the central questions in this hearing. I can tell you this much. I know how the President answers that. The President said he wanted to nominate somebody in the mold of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas, and I think one of the questions in these hearings has been the extent to which, for instance, Judge Alito is going to be perhaps more like those Justices, or perhaps like some other Justices, Justice O’Connor or Justice Harlan, as he suggested. And so if he is going to fit that mold, then obviously the balance shifts in a number of important cases in a certain direction. But if he is not, then, of course, it is going to be harder to predict. I might venture at least this much. I think that if he is truly going to be a bottom-up judge, as he suggests, then I think the shift is not going to be that great. In other words, the shift would be more modest. That is the critical thing. The critical thing about

700
being a bottom-up judge is that that is the essence of modesty. There is very little margin of error when you are a judge and you are a bottom-up judge. But if you turn out to be a top-down judge, there is a greater potential for margin of error, and so if he does turn out to be more like Justice Thomas and Justice Scalia, there is a greater possibility for error.
Senator BIDEN. Well, there would be an awful lot of disappointed folks in Washington and the Nation if he turns out to be like Justice O’Connor. A lot of people will be very upset who are supporting him now.
Let me ask, if I may, anyone who would like to respond on the panel. One of my greatest concerns is, and I must tell you, I have a diminishing regard for the efficacy of hearings on judicial nominees in terms of getting at the truth. I am not in any way implying—
Mr. ISSACHAROFF. Based on the panel? [Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. Yes. [Laughter.] Senator BIDEN. No, no. I am not in any way implying—across the board, Democratic nominees, Republican nominees. It goes to this issue, in my view, of do the people have a right to know what they are about to put on the bench. And the part that concerned me the most, I must tell you, is the Judge’s comments on, or failure to comment on, in at least my view, a clear understanding of what he means by the unitary Executive. It seems very different from what others think unitary Executive means, and scholars that I am aware of, and his discussion about, or failure to respond to what is now a very much animated debate about whether or not the President can wage war without the consent of or authority from the Congress and whether or not, as the administration argues, the War Powers Clause only gives the Congress the power to declare war if it wants to when the President doesn’t want to go to war, which is the most extreme reading I have heard other than one occasion in the Bush I administration. So does anyone here have any doubt that there is a need for the President, absent imminent danger, to get the consent of the Congress before he were to invade Iraq or Syria tomorrow, or does the President have the authority tomorrow, based on his judgment, to invade Iraq and Syria? Does anybody want to venture an opinion on that? Mr. ISSACHAROFF. I think, Senator Biden, that is the lesson of the steel seizure case, including Judge Alito’s invocation of Justice Jackson’s opinion in that case, is that the President acts at tremendous constitutional peril when he acts contrary to the express wishes of Congress and acts at significant constitutional peril when he acts absent congressional authority unless there is true military exigency of the moment. I think that that is fairly well established. That has been the history of the relationship between Congress and the Executive. It has been a difficult history, and the question of how much authorization Congress has given is a repeated issue before the courts and has been since the Civil War cases. But I don’t think that there is any doubt on this question constitutionally.

Senator BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Biden. Senator Cornyn? Senator CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess I would just have to express some reservations at trying to predict how Judge Alito is going to rule on the bench. I can think of famous examples where President George Herbert Walker Bush thought David Souter was going to be of a particular frame of mind or approach on the bench. I guess Richard Nixon probably had some ideas about Harry Blackmun and President Eisenhower had some ideas about Earl Warren. Judicial independence means something, and what it hopefully means is exactly what the Framers intended in terms of providing the flexibility, the freedom, the independence. They have life tenure. We can’t cut their salary. Who knows? This is, I guess, a debate only lawyers can love. It is important, but I just don’t know how we can answer the question comprehensively. Professor Issacharoff, it is good to see you again. Of course, I got to know you during your tenure at the University of Texas Law School before you came up north to NYU. There have been some questions about Judge Alito’s statements, about his concerns about the Warren Court decisions on reapportionment, and you alluded to that in your testimony. The fact is, our nation has a checkered history, doesn’t it, in terms of enfranchising people, making sure that everyone’s vote counts roughly the same? Back, I guess, at the beginning of our nation, people had to have property before they could vote. We know that some people couldn’t vote at all, AfricanAmericans, and we fought a Civil War and amended the Constitution on that. We know that even today, the Texas congressional redistricting case is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. This remains a subject of a lot of interest and a lot of controversy, but I just want to make sure that we are not guilty, those of us on this side of the dais, about overstating or reading too much, I should say, into what Judge Alito has said. He said in college, he was motivated by a deep interest in constitutional law, motivated in large part by disagreement with Warren Court decisions, particularly in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment. Let us talk about reapportionment, which is, I know, one of your passions and expertise. It wasn’t until 1962 when the Supreme Court decided that those issues were justiciable in the first place, wasn’t it, in Baker v. Carr? Mr. ISSACHAROFF. That is correct, Senator. Senator CORNYN. And then the principle of one person/one vote was decided in Reynolds v. Sims in 1964, I believe. Is that the right time? Mr. ISSACHAROFF. Yes. Senator CORNYN. The right case? Mr. ISSACHAROFF. Yes. Senator CORNYN. And, of course, notwithstanding what some have tried to make out of what Judge Alito said, he has testified here and in other areas that he considers one person/one vote a bedrock of our democracy. You have said everybody believes that, at least every American believes that today, although it was fairly

702
controversial not that many decades ago, or at least in terms of the court’s role.
What he did say, and I want to get your comment on this, is that—and maybe it was because of his father’s experience, as you alluded to a little bit—that strict numerical precision in terms of the size of districts, whether they be for city councilmen, whether it be for a State representative, a State Senator or Congressman or whatever, there was sort of the troublesome issue of how do you deal with things like municipal boundaries and communities of interest, lines that ordinarily you would think define those communities of interest in a way that you just don’t want to run roughshod over. Is that a legitimate consideration on the way to try to achieve that goal of one person/one vote, or is that just bogus?
Mr. ISSACHAROFF. I think, Senator—and I still have the temptation to refer to you as Justice Cornyn—but Senator, I think that it is absolutely a legitimate concern. I think that one person/one vote turns out to do two things. One, it is emblematic. It is our aspiration that everybody be equal in the political process.
And secondarily, and perhaps more importantly, it serves as a check on what those in power can do to try to preserve themselves in power, and that second feature of it has been difficult and the efforts to ratchet up mathematical exactitude have usually come in cases that were about something completely different. For example, in the New Jersey case in the mid-1980s, Karcher v. Daggett, the real issue was a partisan gerrymander and everybody understood that and the court didn’t know what to do about it, just as it has had trouble with that issue for the decade since, and so it fell back on this extraordinary mathematical exactitude, which, in fact, is completely illusory because the census isn’t that precise.
So I agree with you fully. I don’t think that that was where the controversy had moved in the late 1960s. I would stay by that statement. But nonetheless, you are absolutely right that this is a legitimate course of concern.
Senator CORNYN. Professor, thank you. My time is up. I appreciate your response to my question. Thank you.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. Senator Coburn? Senator COBURN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have been listening. I was not here for all of it, but I was paying attention by the video screen in the back room, and just some observations. You know, I live on Capitol Hill with two Democrats and the things that normally asked of them is, how can you live with that guy? And their answer is you don’t know his heart. And then I get asked the same thing: how can you live with those two guys? And I say you don’t know his heart. And it strikes me as I look at this panel, the three people who testified favorably for Judge Alito know him and the three people who didn’t testify—who testified somewhat negatively about Judge Alito don’t know him. They have read some of his cases, not all of his cases. And so it just kind of strikes me that one of the most valuable pieces of information that this Committee has gotten from outside witnesses was the judge panel that came before you, the people that have worked with him for over a decade, worked with him in a closed room. I believe they know his heart. And I believe

anyone in this room—you can take anything that we have written at some time or said at some time and you can make each of us look terrible.
And I only have really one question and that is for Professor Liu. How do you explain the fact that Judge Lewis, who is adamant about Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, his observations about Judge Alito are completely contrary to yours? How do you explain that? Here is a guy that knows him, here is a guy that has very liberal leanings in terms of the political spectrum, here is a guy that is basing his whole legal career on civil rights. And yet he says I know this man and there is no a bit of truth in any bias or any direction that he goes.
How do you explain that? Mr. LIU. Well, Senator Coburn, I certainly can’t dispute Judge Lewis’s account or views on Judge Alito. I understand the previous panel to be testifying to the integrity and intellectual honesty of the nominee, none of which I dispute. In fact, I conceded in the very first sentence of my testimony that I find him also to be an intellectually honest person. My only viewpoint, I guess, that I am offering is not really a viewpoint at all. What I am trying to simply urge is that some attention be paid to his record and that the record speaks for itself. And it doesn’t speak to the nominee’s intellectual—any negatives regarding the nominee’s intellectual honesty. Rather, I think it speaks more to the set of values or instincts or the intangible qualities of judging, I think, that every judge, every human being brings into the world. It is not that any judge decides to go about any case saying, oh, I come in with this bias or I come in with that bias. I grant that Judge Alito, like every judge, tries to be impartial, but every judge also has a set of instincts, a central tendency, and I think it can be revealed, not definitively, but it can be revealed by looking at patterns across large numbers of cases. Senator COBURN. And you looked at 50 cases of his. Is that correct? Mr. LIU. Well, I have actually looked at more, but the cases that I have— Senator COBURN. How many more? Mr. LIU. I have probably looked at 60 or 70 cases. Senator COBURN. Out of 4,000? Mr. LIU. Out of the 360 that he has written. Senator COBURN. Written opinions on, but he still has adjudicated over 4,000 cases. Mr. LIU. Certainly, that is true. Senator COBURN. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Coburn. I had hoped to finish up this evening, but the sense of the proceeding at this point is that it is not a wise thing to do. This panel took an hour and 15 minutes, and projecting with a break, we would be in the ten o’clock range or perhaps even later. That would depend upon how many Senators were here to question, and I think in the morning we may have more questions.

704 I think it is a fair observation that we are not at our best. We started at nine, so we are in the tenth or eleventh hour. And we have tomorrow to proceed and still meet the schedule that I had announced early. I know that it is a likely inconvenience to some of the people who were on the later panels, although nobody on the latter panels, if we were to finish tonight, would be out of this town tonight anyway. So it is really staying over, and I know that in making your plans to come here, you didn’t know whether you would testify on Thursday or Friday and nobody else knew whether you would testify on Thursday or Friday. We tried to follow the Roberts model, but on Roberts we finished up his testimony close to 11 and today we didn’t start on the outside witnesses until 2:30. That is probably more than you want to know, but I like to tell you what is on my mind. I see some of the witnesses on the later panels nodding an affirmative. Nobody seems to be too distressed about calling it a day at 6:36 after starting at 9 a.m. So we will be in tomorrow morning at 9. Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, could I enter into the record a letter from the National Association of Women’s Lawyers at an appropriate place, and then also a letter from Professor Higginbotham, as well, at an appropriate place in the record? Chairman SPECTER. Certainly. Without objection, they will be placed in the record at what we conclude to be an appropriate place after consulting with you. Thank you all very much. That concludes our hearing. [Whereupon, at 6:36 p.m., the Committee was adjourned, to reconvene at 9 a.m., Friday, January 13, 2006.]

NOMINATION OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., OF NEW JERSEY, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
FRIDAY, JANUARY 13, 2006
U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,
Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:02 a.m., in room SH–216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman of the Committee presiding. Present: Senators Specter, Hatch, DeWine, Sessions, Cornyn, Coburn, Leahy, Kennedy, Feinstein, and Schumer. Chairman SPECTER. The hearings for the confirmation of Judge Alito for the Supreme Court of the United States will now reconvene. I have just been discussing with Senator Leahy the allocation of time, and we had seven judges who testified yesterday who exceeded the 5 minutes. I thought it the better part of prudence to not bang the gavel, but allow them to go on, but they did take some extra time, in the seven-, eight, nine-minute range. So I have just said to Senator Leahy that we will give seven of the witnesses selected by Democrats five extra minutes, or he can allocate the time as he chooses. I don’t want to split hairs over how much the exact time was, but I think it is very important to keep the balance. And we did that in the selection of the number, 30. In the past, it had been divided about 18 to 12, with the majority party taking more. But we have worked out the arrangement of 15 to 15 to keep it level. Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, if I might, you have been fair on this. Ultimately, of course, everything has to be determined based on what the nominee says, but the public witnesses are important. You know, when we are deciding whether to replace Justice Sandra Day O’Connor with Samuel Alito, I think they help focus us, as the witnesses yesterday did, on aspects of his record on the bench with respect to civil rights and privacy rights. These are long-time pioneers in our Nation’s sometimes rocky journey toward equal justice and respect for women’s rights. They are the people on the front line today. We are going to hear from representatives of minority communities. We have a number of written statements. As I have said over and over again, we are the only 18 people who get to ask questions on behalf of 295 million Americans and of generations for a long time to come. So I think these hearings

are important. Again, I thank you for your courtesies and your fairness in keeping them going.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. We now turn to our first witness on our next panel, Professor Nora Demleitner, from the Hofstra School of Law. She teaches and has written widely on criminal, comparative and immigration law; Managing Editor of the Federal Sentencing Reporter, and serves on the executive editorial board of the American Journal of Comparative Law; a Bates graduate, summa cum laude, and a graduate from the Yale Law School in 1992—we have a heavy representation of Yale Law graduates here; that is a very healthy thing—and was Symposium Editor of the Yale Law Journal. I didn’t know there was a Symposium Editor. There wasn’t one there in my time. Thank you for joining us, Professor, and the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF NORA V. DEMLEITNER, VICE DEAN FOR ACADEMIC AFFAIRS AND PROFESSOR OF LAW, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW, HEMPSTEAD, NEW YORK
Ms. DEMLEITNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, members of the Committee. Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to testify today. The one thing I should—
Chairman SPECTER. I should have added, Professor, that you clerked for Judge Alito after graduating from law school. I think that ought to be on the record.
Start the clock back at 5 minutes. Ms. DEMLEITNER. I was about to add that. Thank you very much. Now, since the very early days of my clerkship, I must admit that Judge Alito has really become my role model. I do think that he is one of the most brilliant legal minds of our generation, or of his generation, and he is a man of great decency, integrity and character. And I say all of this as what I would consider to be a left-leaning Democrat; a woman, obviously; a member of the ACLU; and an immigrant. And my view is not one that is unique with regard to people who have worked with him or with regard to people who have worked for Judge Alito. Now, all of his clerks, many of whom are politically liberal, have signed on to a letter strongly urging the Senate to confirm Judge Alito as Associate Justice. A number of non-Republican legal academics who have worked with or for Judge Alito have also issued an equally forceful statement on his behalf. Let me explain to you why I believe that Samuel Alito deserves to sit on the highest Court and why his confirmation will, in fact, not pose a threat to the rights of women, to the rights of minorities, immigrants, or other vulnerable groups. Now, Judge Alito does not have a political agenda. He gives very careful consideration to the lower court record and to prior judicial decisions. Now, let me point you to two cases that may explain the judge’s philosophy. While I clerked for him, he had to decide the case of Parastoo Fatin. Ms. Fatin had left Iran in part to be escaping the regime of Ayatollah Khomeini. She applied for asylum in the United States, but was denied by the immigration court and by the Board of Immigration Appeals.

707
Now, without revealing any confidences, I can tell you that Judge Alito was very much moved by the personal tragedy of the situation and the moral dilemma Ms. Fatin would face. If returned to Iran, she would either be unable to speak her deep feminist convictions or the Iranian regime would penalize her.
Now, the problem with her case was that there was really an absence of favorable case law and, even worse, a very thin record that indicates only very limited opposition on her part to the Iranian regime.
Now, the judge did not see himself in a position to help Ms. Fatin, who was, however, ultimately permitted to stay in the United States. He, however, did take this opportunity to write one of the most progressive opinions on gender-based asylum. Now, his decision was the first to recognize that gender alone could constitute a basis for asylum. This revolution in asylum law has not been widely recognized outside a very small group of asylum practitioners, and neither has Judge Alito gotten a whole lot of credit for garnering the votes of both of his fellow panelists for this decision, one of whom was a Nixon appointee.
Now, the Fatin case hasn’t gotten a lot of attention, but you have spent part of the day yesterday on the Rybar case, where Judge Alito dissented. Now, I think you should read the case a little differently than the way in which it has been portrayed. Now, let me just set the context.
In 1995, the Supreme Court decided Lopez, Justice O’Connor joining the majority striking down the possession of machine guns on school grounds as unconstitutional. Now, I think a lot of commentators expected this to create a major shift in lower court jurisprudence. This did not happen, I think, in part because the lower courts read the decision extremely narrowly and arguably incorrectly.
Now, Judge Alito, who has been, I think, generally labeled as an anti-criminal defendant judge, was very much willing to follow Supreme Court precedent to the point where it would necessitate the dismissal of a host of criminal indictments. At the same time, he took pains to note that Congress could very easily remedy the problem with the statute by indicating in the record that there was a connection between the possession of machine guns and interstate commerce. Now, let me also point you to the fact that a blue ribbon ABA task force has increasingly critiqued the increasing Federalization of criminal law.
Now, Judge Alito’s record, I think, indicates, and Rybar confirms, that he will follow Supreme Court cases very carefully, and that he will read congressional legislation very carefully. He has also used, I think, his prior background experience very effectively in working, for example, on sentencing reform with the Constitution Project and at one point as an advisory board member of the Federal Sentencing Reporter.
I believe overall that his criminal background experience will inform the judge’s decision, but it will surely not bias him in one way or the other. He will be able to strike a practical balance that is informed, but not predetermined by his background.
And for all those reasons, I believe very strongly that he deserves to be confirmed as the Court’s next Associate Justice.

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor. We now turn to Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, the Alston & Bird Professor of Law and Political Science at Duke. Prior to coming to Duke in 2004, he had been for 21 years at the University of Southern California Law School, where he was the Irmas Professor of Public Interest Law. He is a graduate of Northwestern University with a bachelor’s degree, and a law degree from Harvard. Last year, he was named by Legal Affairs as one of the top 20 legal thinkers in America. Thank you for coming in today, Professor, and the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY, ALSTON & BIRD PROFESSOR OF LAW AND POLITICAL SCIENCE, DUKE UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA
Mr. CHEMERINSKY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, distinguished Senators. It is truly an honor and a privilege to testify at these historic hearings.
It is impossible to overstate the importance of this nomination to the future of constitutional law. In recent years, the Supreme Court was often referred to as the O’Connor Court because Sandra Day O’Connor so often has been in the majority in 5–4 decisions in crucial areas: protecting reproductive freedom, enforcing the separation of church and state, limiting Presidential power, and advancing racial justice. Replacing her has the possibility of dramatic changes in so many areas of constitutional law.
A crucial question for this Committee is what will be the effect of Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court. I want to focus on one area, Executive power. I choose this area because no area of constitutional law is likely to be more important in years ahead than this.
As you know, in recent years the Bush administration has made unprecedented claims of expansive Presidential power, such as the claim of authority to detain American citizens as enemy combatants without meeting the Constitution’s requirements for warrant, grand jury, or trial by jury; the claim of authority to torture human beings, in violation of international law; the claim of authority to eavesdrop on conversations of Americans without complying with the Fourth Amendment or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act; the claim of authority to hold American citizens indefinitely and citizens of other countries indefinitely as enemy combatants.
Now, my goal here isn’t to discuss the merits of any of these issues; instead, to point to the fact that separation of powers is likely to be an enormously important issue in the years ahead. And, of course, there is no need to remind this body of the crucial role that checks and balances and separation of powers play in our constitutional structure.
Some of the most important Supreme Court cases in history have been those where the Court has said no to assertions of Presidential power, such as in Youngstown Sheet and Tube v. Sawyer in striking down President Truman’s seizure of the steel mills, and United States v. Nixon in saying that President Nixon had to reveal the Watergate tapes.

A key question for this Committee is whether Samuel Alito will continue this tradition of enforcing checks and balances or whether he will be a rubber stamp for Presidential power. I have carefully read the writings, the speeches and the decisions of Samuel Alito in this area and they all point in one direction—a very troubling pattern of great deference to Executive authority.
I have closely followed the hearings this week and I know you are familiar with the examples. To mention just a few, in 1984 while in the Solicitor General’s office, Samuel Alito wrote a memo saying that he believed that the Attorney General should have absolute immunity to civil suits for money damages of engaging in illegal wiretapping, a position the Supreme Court rejected in language that seems so appropriate now in saying there was too great a danger of violation of rights from executive officials who, in their zeal to protect national security, would go too far.
The next year, he said there should be increased use of Presidential signing statements. He said, quote, ‘‘The President should have the last word as to the meaning of statutes,’’ which would mean an increase in Executive power.
As you know, in a number of writings and speeches, he said he believed in the unitary Executive theory. Now, there was a good deal of discussion this week as to what that means. But if you look at the literature of constitutional law, those who believe in a unitary Executive truly want a radical change in American Government. They believe that independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Communications Commission are unconstitutional. They believe the special prosecutor is unconstitutional. They reject the ability of Congress to limit the Executive.
Now, as a judge on the Third Circuit, Judge Alito has not had the opportunity to review assertions of Presidential power, but there have been many cases where he has considered assertions of law enforcement authority. Over and again, he comes down on the side of law enforcement.
I think his dissenting opinions are particularly revealing because Judge Becker said he rarely dissents. One case, I think, shows Judge Alito’s overall philosophy and it is one discussed yesterday at the end of the day, Doe v. Groody. This, of course, was the case where the police strip-searched a mother and her 10-year-old daughter who were suspected of no crime.
As Carter Phillips said yesterday, this was an issue of qualified immunity. That means did the officers violate clearly established law that a reasonable officer—should the officer have known that it violates the Constitution? Senators, any police officer, any judge should know that strip-searching a 10-year-old girl who is suspected of nothing violated the Constitution. Senators, this is one of so many cases where Judge Alito deferred to law enforcement.
I am here for a simple reason. I believe that at this point in time it is too dangerous to have a person like Samuel Alito, with his writings and records on Executive power, on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Chemerinsky appears as a submission for the record.]

Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor. We now turn to Professor Anthony Kronman. After teaching at the University of Chicago Law School and Minnesota Law School, Professor Kronman came to Yale, where he has been on the faculty for 16 years and was the dean of the law school from 1994 to the year 2004, and is the Sterling Professor of Law at Yale. He has his undergraduate degree from Williams in 1968, with highest honors, a Ph.D. in philosophy, and a law degree from Yale in 1975, when he was a classmate of Judge Alito. Thank you for being with us today, Professor, and the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF ANTHONY KRONMAN, STERLING PROFESSOR OF LAW AND FORMER DEAN, YALE LAW SCHOOL, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT
Mr. KRONMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, other members of the Committee. I am grateful for the opportunity to appear this morning and offer my testimony.
I have known Sam Alito for 33 years, since we met in the fall of 1972 as members of the entering class at the Yale Law School. Over the next 3 years, we took nearly a third of our law school courses together. We worked on the law journal together. We debated in the moot court program. I had a chance to observe Sam Alito at close range and to form an estimate of his character.
Sam was hard-working and ferociously bright. No one, I think, would challenge that, but that wasn’t the first thing that impressed me about Sam. What impressed me first and most emphatically was his generosity and gentleness. When Sam spoke in class or out, others listened. But when others spoke, Sam listened, and not just in the superficial sense of waiting politely until they had finished, but in the deeper and more consequential sense of straining to grasp the good sense of their position and to see it in its most attractive light.
Sam always spoke with modesty, but even when he was defending a position that he believed clearly to be right, did so with the knowledge that he might be wrong. Learned Hand once described the spirit of liberty as the spirit ‘‘that is not too sure of itself.’’ That is a phrase that has always had a special meaning for me and it well describes the quality in Sam that I noticed from the start.
I noticed something else and admired something else as well, and that was Sam’s faith in the law. Sam believed in the integrity of the law and in the essential fairness of its processes. Anyone who has studied the law knows that it is not a mechanical system. It requires moral judgments at many points.
But there is all the difference in the world between a person who approaches the law from the outside and views it as an instrument for the advancement of some program of one kind or another and a person who approaches it from the inside and whose fundamental, leading allegiance is to the law itself.
Sam falls clearly in that second category. He had, so far as I could tell, no political agenda of any kind. I would have described him in law school as a lawyer’s lawyer, and if you had asked me on the day we graduated whether he was a Democrat, as I was then and am today, or a Republican, I couldn’t have told you.

My knowledge of Sam Alito is based almost entirely on my personal acquaintance with the man, but since his nomination to the Supreme Court, I have attempted, as have many others, to glean at least a sense of his judicial temperament by reading a few of his opinions. I haven’t read many. I haven’t made a systematic study of them, but the ones that I have read suggest to me rather strongly that the judicial temperament that I discern in these opinions is entirely consistent with the human temperament of the man I came to know and admire more than 30 years ago.
The temperament of the judge, as I see it, is marked by modesty, by caution, by deference to others in different roles with different responsibilities, by an acute appreciation of the limitations of his own office, and by a deep and abiding respect for the past.
There is a name that we give to all of these qualities, taken together. We call them judiciousness, and in calling them that we recognize that they are the special virtues of a judge. Judge Alito has been a judicious judge and my confidence that he will be a judicious Justice is based on my personal knowledge of the man and my belief that his judicial temperament is rooted in his human character, which is the deepest and strongest foundation it could have.
Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kronman appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Kronman. We turn now to Ms. Beth Nolan, a partner in Crowell & Moring’s Litigation Group. She has a broad practice which focuses on constitutional and public policy issues. Ms. Nolan held prestigious and high-ranking positions in the Clinton administration and the Department of Justice in the Office of Legal Counsel. She had been a clerk to Chief Judge Collins Seitz, of the Third Circuit, has an undergraduate degree from Scripps College and a law degree, magna cum laude, from Georgetown in 1980. Thank you for being with us today, Ms. Nolan, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF BETH NOLAN, PARTNER, CROWELL & MORING, LLP, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Ms. NOLAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, members of the Committee. I am delighted to be here today, and thank you for inviting me to provide my views.
I want to address one issue: how Judge Alito, if he should become Justice Alito, would approach questions of Executive power. I have served, as you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, in the White House as Counsel to the President and in political and career positions in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Clinton and Reagan administrations.
And as might be expected of one who has served as Legal Counsel to the President, I believe it is essential to defend the power of the President to undertake his constitutionally assigned responsibilities and to resist illegitimate incursions on that power. And certainly, in my position as White House Counsel, I sometimes was in conflict with Congress, as each branch struggled to assert its views of its authority.

712
This does not mean, however, that the Executive should assert a view of its power that is virtually unconstrained or that fails to take account of the constitutional powers of Congress. Presidential power should be interpreted even by lawyers for the President with proper respect for the coordinate branches, not solely to maximize Presidential power.
Judge Alito’s service, as has been mentioned, on the Third Circuit has not offered him much opportunity to address issues of Executive power, but we do have some indication of his views, and I find particularly instructive and troubling his 2000 Federalist Society remarks in which he announced his support of the unitary Executive theory. What he means by that support is a critical question.
It is a small phrase in one way, ‘‘unitary Executive,’’ but it has almost limitless import to many of its adherents. At one level, it embodies the concept of Presidential control over all executive functions; as Professor Chemerinsky mentioned, a concept that has been soundly rejected by the Supreme Court.
But the phrase also often serves to embrace a bundle of expansive interpretations of the President’s substantive powers and correspondingly stringent limits on the legislative and judicial branches. This is the apparent meaning of the phrase in many of this administration’s signing statements claiming broad powers for the President.
In his Federalist Society speech, Judge Alito endorsed the theory of the unitary Executive as developed during the period he served in the Office of Legal Counsel as a supervising deputy. An important question is how he views OLC precedents from that time. In one opinion from that time involving covert activities, OLC expressed the President’s authority in sweeping terms, adopting Justice Sutherland’s dicta from a very different context to assert that the President’s authority to act in the field of international relations is plenary, exclusive and subject to no legal limitations, save those derived from the applicable provisions of the Constitution itself, while declaring that Congress had only those powers in the area of foreign affairs that directly involve the exercise of legal authority over U.S. citizens.
This would seem to mean that the President is essentially above the law in the areas of foreign affairs, national security and war, and Congress is powerless to act as a constraint against Presidential overreaching in these areas. It is a fair question whether Judge Alito agrees with these sweeping views.
This is not just of historical interest, of course. That version of unitary Executive from the 1980s sounds remarkably similar to the assertions of unreviewable and unconstrained powers the current President has asserted with regard to this authority to ignore the laws passed by Congress, such as those forbidding torture and those regulating electronic surveillance. These issues may well come before the Supreme Court.
Judge Alito indicated over 20 years ago his strenuous disagreement with the usurpation by the judiciary of the decisionmaking authority of political branches. Does this signal that he will defer to the executive branch’s positions on its power and its claims that these positions are largely unreviewable, or will he, as Justice

O’Connor did in Hamdi, see a clear role for the courts in protecting our constitutional balance and hence our civil liberties? Judge Alito’s statements about Executive power raise legitimate and serious questions that should be explored.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Nolan appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Nolan. Our next witness is Professor Charles Fried, of the Harvard Law School, an expert in the areas of constitutional, legal and moral philosophy. From 1985 to 1989, he was Solicitor General of the United States, and from 1995 through 1999 he was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Princeton, a doctor of law from Columbia, and both a bachelor’s and master’s from Oxford University. Professor Fried, in his capacity as Solicitor General, was Judge Alito’s superior when Judge Alito worked in that office. Thank you for joining us, Professor Fried, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, AND BENEFICIAL PROFESSOR OF LAW, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS
Mr. FRIED. Thank you, Chairman Specter, and I thank the members of the Committee for inviting me.
I think what I can most usefully do is cast some light on Judge Alito’s—and if I slip into ‘‘Sam,’’ please forgive me, because we were a small and very colleaguely and friendly office—Judge Alito’s work in that office.
The Reagan administration, no doubt, had a point of view about the law, just as did the FDR administration in 1933 or the JFK administration in 1961. That is not unusual. That is what elections are about. Part of that view encompassed the notion that the lower courts had gone too far in limiting the ability of law enforcement; that the lower courts had moved too far away from an appropriate view of affirmative action, as expressed by Justice Powell in Bakke, toward quotas. And I suppose emblematic of the notion that courts sometimes just make things up was the notion that Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided, a notion which, may I say, was shared by people across the political spectrum—Professor Paul Freund; Archibald Cox expressed that view as late as 1985; and Dean Ely.
Now, the first job of the staff of the Solicitor General’s office was to make sure that when the Solicitor General presented the Solicitor General’s client’s position to the Supreme Court, this was done in a professional, correct and respectful way.
That office had career lawyers, some of whom stretched back to the time of Lyndon Johnson. I myself appointed as deputies people who I knew to be Democrats, liberal Democrats. None of that bothered me or bothered them because we were a professional office and they understood that their work was professional work. That is exactly how Judge Alito viewed his work.
If I look at the two examples that have been much featured in these discussions, his memo to me in the Thornburgh case on Roe v. Wade—it is said that he argued that Roe v. Wade should be over-
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00725 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.004 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

714
ruled. He did not. You need only read that memo because he said in that memo that we should not argue that Roe v. Wade should be overruled. I didn’t follow that advice, but that was what the advice was.
Similarly, it said that he argued for the absolute immunity of the Attorney General in connection with wiretaps. He did not. What he said was I don’t question that immunity, but we should not propose that argument; we should not make that argument to the Court.
Now, in 1985 he wanted a job in the administration, and at that point he took on a different role and he spoke in a different tone of voice. I think that is perfectly understandable and appropriate. And when, 15 years later, he became a judge—when, 15 years ago, he became a judge, he once again assumed a different role. His whole career shows that he understands the different between a professional lawyer, an advocate, and a judge. And no more eloquent testimony of that understanding can be had than the wonderful testimony of his colleagues, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, who served with him for those 15 years.
I believe that it is perfectly appropriate for this panel, for this Committee, to have probed Judge Alito’s disposition. Everybody has a disposition. He is in the mainstream. He tends toward the right bank of the mainstream, I agree. When this Senate approved two wonderful judges to be Justices, Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, it was perfectly plain that they tended toward the left bank of the mainstream and they were confirmed, and properly so. I believe Judge Alito should be as well.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Fried appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Fried. Our next witness is Professor Laurence Tribe, Loeb University Professor at Harvard University and Professor of Constitutional Law at the Harvard Law School. Professor Tribe has argued before the U.S. Supreme Court over 33 times, served as a law clerk to Justice Potter Stewart, and received his bachelor’s degree from Harvard College, summa cum laude, in 1962, and his law degree also from Harvard, magna cum laude, in 1966. Professor Tribe, the floor is yours.
STATEMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, CARL M. LOEB UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS
Mr. TRIBE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a great honor to be here on this very important occasion.
I am not here to endorse the nomination of Judge Alito, as I did with my most recent testimony before this Committee on a Supreme Court nomination with Justice Kennedy. I am not here to oppose his nomination, as I did several months before that time with Robert Bork. And I am not here to lecture the Committee on its responsibilities or its role. I don’t think that is my role.
I think the only useful function that I can perform is to ensure to the limited extent I can that Senators not cast their votes with, to borrow an image from a Kubrick movie, their eyes wide shut.

715
It is quite clear that there are two central concerns in the country and in the Senate with respect to this nomination, and they do not relate, honestly, to what a truly admirable, collegial, modest, thoughtful and brilliant fellow Sam Alito is. And I don’t mean to call him ‘‘Sam.’’ I don’t really know him the way that my colleague, Charles, does.
They relate to whether Justice Alito might, by casting a decisive fifth vote on many cases, narrow the scope of personal liberty, especially for women, and broaden the scope of Presidential power at a time when we see dramatically the dangers of an unfettered Executive by weakening the ability of both Congress and the courts to restrict Presidential assertions of authority.
A word first about liberty. It is certainly true that in the Solicitor General’s office the memorandum that Judge Alito wrote for the Solicitor General did not urge that the Court be confronted frontally, overrule Roe. But he made it clear even then that the strategy he thought wise to pursue was a step-by-step process toward the ultimate goal of overruling Roe.
That is the only prospect on the table. I assure you that if the Supreme Court actually overrules Roe, I will have thousands of students to tell that I predicted the wrong thing. That is not the danger. They won’t say Roe v. Wade is hereby overruled. What they will do—and I am saying ‘‘will’’ because I am assuming that confirmation will occur. Maybe it won’t, but with the vote of Judge Alito as Justice Alito, the Court will cut back on Roe v. Wade step by step, not just to the point where, as the moderate American center has it, abortion is cautiously restricted, but to the point where the fundamental underlying right to liberty becomes a hollow shell.
It is the liberty interest which occurs not only in Roe, but in the right to die and in many cases that we can’t predict over the next century, and certainly over the 30 years that Justice Alito would serve—it is that underlying liberty which is at stake. And it is crucial to know that Judge Alito dramatically misstated the current state of the law, and I say that with deference and respect, but it was clear.
When pushed on whether he still believed, as he said, not in his role as a Government lawyer but in his personal capacity that he believed the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion— when he was asked, do you still believe that, he said, well, I would approach it by starting with Casey. Casey, in 1992, he said, began and ended with precedent, stare decisis. Casey simply followed Roe. And he thereby avoided the issue.
That is not true. Casey split the baby in half; that is, Casey said there are two fundamental questions here. One, does the woman have a fundamental liberty at stake when she is pregnant and wants to make a decision? And No. 2, assuming she does, at what point does the state’s interest in the fetus trump the woman’s liberty?
On the liberty issue, the Court did not rely on stare decisis and Roe. The moderate Justices who wrote the joint opinion, Justices O’Connor and Kennedy and Souter, said that on the underlying issue of liberty, we agree clearly the woman’s liberty is important, special, not just like the right to fix prices, because if we didn’t think that and if we had a case where a teenage girl was being

716
forced to have an abortion, her liberty wouldn’t be special either. And therefore we must conclude, without relying on Roe, this is a liberty deserving of special protection.
Never in the descriptions that you heard from Judge Alito with respect to the issues in Roe did he confront the question, does he too believe that that liberty is special or does he, as did Robert Bork and as do many, believe that there is no special liberty. Simply because the woman happens to have a fetus inside her, her interest is no greater than my interest in learning how to play tennis.
So it seems to me clear that the indications we have of Judge Alito’s belief are that he does not have a conviction that that liberty is special, and he is unwilling not only to commit to treating this as a so-called super precedent; he is not even willing to indicate to this Committee that he believes that the Court has a special role in protecting intimate personal liberties.
Now, with respect to consolidating the powers of the President, I want to associate myself completely with the remarks of Beth Nolan. It is very clear that with respect to the unitary Executive theory that is being espoused that what you saw in the instance of Judge Alito’s testimony was not a forthright description of what he said he believed—
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Tribe, you are a minute-and-a-half over. If you could summarize, I would appreciate it.
Mr. TRIBE. I am sorry. I will certainly summarize. When he spoke in November of 2000, after Morrison was decided, he outlined a strategy for consolidating the power of the President, notwithstanding Morrison. And I think it is easy to explain, but I won’t try to do it over time. The distinction he tried to draw between the President’s control of functions within his power and the scope of Executive power is a completely phony distinction. Chairman SPECTER. Professor Tribe, did you say you were not testifying against Judge Alito? Mr. TRIBE. I am not recommending any action. I am recommending that everybody, because I think it is foolish—nobody really cares what I think. Chairman SPECTER. Aside from your recommendation, are you saying you are not testifying against Judge Alito? Mr. TRIBE. I am not testifying for or against Judge Alito. I am explaining why I am very troubled by his views. Obviously, it follows from that that I would be hard-pressed to recommend his confirmation. [The prepared statement of Mr. Tribe appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. The clock needs to start at 5 minutes even for the Chairman and for everybody. I had already started the 5minute round, but we will proceed. And as we all know, after the panel testifies, each Senator has 5 minutes of questioning. Professor Fried, you testified in the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts that you thought Roe was wrong decided, but you also thought that Roe should not be overruled. And that is based on the reliance and upon the precedents and upon stare decisis. You have worked closely with Judge Alito. I know you have followed his career. What is your sense as to how Judge Alito will ap-

717
proach the Roe issue if it should come before the Court for reversal or being sustained in the context of your understanding of his approach to stare decisis?
Mr. FRIED. Well, I think it is a version, but only a version of what my colleague and friend, Larry Tribe, has said. I think he will not—and Larry agrees with that—move toward a frontal overruling, just as he has been urged and others have urged should happen. That is my belief, and I could be quite wrong. I could be quite wrong about that, but that is my belief.
Now, the idea that he would chip away at it—I am not sure I know what that means. When the Casey decision came down and Justice O’Connor—and it is clearly Justice O’Connor—moved from the very strict, almost abortion-on-demand standards of Roe toward the undue burden standard, a cry went up from the community which I think Professor Tribe is associated with that this was a disaster. But, in fact, it was a reasonable thing to do.
And we do not know what the future holds, but I don’t expect him to do things which would be other than in the reasonable tradition of Casey, which I agree with Professor Tribe is a much better decision and a much better-founded decision than Roe.
Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Nolan, the critical issue which the Congress is going to be looking at and this Committee is going to hold a hearing on is the President’s power on eavesdropping without a warrant, in contravention of the specific provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
During the Clinton administration, Deputy Attorney General Jaime Gorelick testified—I see you nodding; you know she testified that the President had inherent authority to conduct those warrantless searches.
What have you seen—aside from the generalizations of unitary power, anything specific in the record of Judge Alito that he has a view on that critical issue?
Ms. NOLAN. First of all, I just want to be clear that Deputy Attorney General Gorelick’s testimony was about inherent authority in the absence of a statutory provision. It was physical searches not covered by FISA, so just to clarify that.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, she testified during the Clinton administration, which was long after FISA was adopted.
Ms. NOLAN. Yes, but it didn’t cover physical searches and that was the question at that time. It was part of the Ames case. And, in fact, the administration brought to Congress a request that FISA be amended to cover physical searches.
Chairman SPECTER. OK, on to Judge Alito. Ms. NOLAN. I am not aware of anything in Judge Alito’s record with regard to that. Chairman SPECTER. Professor Chemerinsky, do you think—you comment on the issue as to Judge Alito as to whether he would be a rubber stamp or not for Executive power. Do you think he would be a rubber stamp. Mr. CHEMERINSKY. Everything that I could find in his record points to tremendous deference to Executive authority. Chairman SPECTER. Well, tremendous deference is a little different from being a rubber stamp.

Mr. CHEMERINSKY. I think the key question that this Committee has to face is will this be a Justice who on these issues that we are talking about come before the Court will be willing to enforce checks and balances. In light of his entire career before going on the bench being in the executive branch, in light of his writings when he was in the Solicitor General’s office, the speeches that he has given and the opinions he has written on the Third Circuit, I don’t find anything to indicate that he will be enforcing checks and balances.
Chairman SPECTER. So you think he would be a rubber stamp? Mr. CHEMERINSKY. I think the record here does speak for itself. I think if we can’t find anything that points to that he will enforce checks and balances— Chairman SPECTER. I have to interrupt you. I want to ask a question of Professor Kronman and Professor Demleitner. There has been a lot of talk about Judge Alito and whether he is deferential to the powerful and to the government. You, Professor Demleitner, were his clerk. You know him pretty well. You know him, Professor Kronman, for several decades. I would like you to address your sense of him on that issue. We will start with you, Professor Demleitner. Ms. DEMLEITNER. I have never seen anything while I clerked for him or in subsequent years that led me to believe that he had an agenda or any kind of plan to favor particular groups over others. He really, in my experience, looks at each case individually, and I am sure he was surprised when he saw the statistics adding up how often he voted for a corporation or for an individual. Quite to the contrary, I think his opening statement was a very powerful one in which he addressed his own background, and I think he indicates that he would not be inclined to favor big government or big corporate interests over individual interests. Chairman SPECTER. Professor Kronman? Mr. KRONMAN. I would agree with that. I have no reason to think that Judge Alito begins with a strong dispositional inclination to always favor governmental power over individual rights. He does, I think, have an inclination to be respectful of those in positions of institutional authority who have wrestled with questions that come before his court and to take seriously the thought they have given to those questions and to weigh them appropriately. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much. Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am curious, and I listened very carefully, Professor Chemerinsky—did I pronounce that correctly, Chemerinsky? Mr. CHEMERINSKY. Yes, you did. Thank you. Senator LEAHY. Thank you. In 2004, in the Hamdi case—and I am sure you are very familiar with that—the Supreme Court considered whether due process required that a citizen of this country who is being held as an enemy combatant should be afforded a meaningful opportunity to challenge the factual basis for the detention. Justice O’Connor’s decision for the Court upheld the fundamental principle of judicial review over Executive authority. She said, in effect, that even if you are at war, whether a declared war or a war

on terror or whatever, it is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation’s citizens.
Now, the unitary Executive theory which Judge Alito espoused in remarks just as recently as 5 years ago was championed in dissent by Justice Thomas in Hamdi, saying that the war powers of the President couldn’t be balanced away by the Court.
Well, I am going to ask you this and then I will ask Ms. Nolan the same question. What are the implications for the rights of Americans to be free from governmental intrusion were Justice Thomas’s views to prevail rather than Justice O’Connor’s?
Mr. CHEMERINSKY. It is an enormously important question. Hamdi was a tremendous victory for all American citizens because, as you say, the Supreme Court said that before an American citizen can be held as an enemy combatant, there must be due process—notice of the charges, an opportunity to be heard, representation by counsel.
There was only one dissent directly to that and that was Justice Thomas, who advances the unitary Executive theory as the reason why the President should be able to hold individuals without due process. You asked, well, what might be the implications of this?
Well, the question would be can the President engage in electronic eavesdropping, in violation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act? It seems clear what the unitary Executive theory would say about that. Can the President hold an American citizen as an enemy combatant without a warrant for arrest, a grand jury indictment, or a jury trial? I can think of nothing more antithetical to the Constitution, but the unitary Executive theory would seem to say yes.
Senator LEAHY. Ms. Nolan, what would you say about that? The professor added this question of wiretapping outside the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. If you could go to my original question, but also tell me what would you have given as advice to the President of the United States if he said, ‘‘I am going to bypass FISA, and I am just going to go wiretap on my own innate authority.’’
Ms. NOLAN. Well, here, I am going to show my credentials as the lawyer to the President and say that I am not exactly sure because we don’t know the full contours of the program. So I want to be clear that it is possible that the President could bring something to me that would make me say under these circumstances of emergency powers—
Senator LEAHY. Let’s go by what you have seen in the press. Ms. NOLAN. By what I have seen, I would say you have to follow FISA or you have to go to Congress and get it amended. Senator LEAHY. And do you agree with Professor Chemerinsky that as to the theory of the unitary Executive, we would be in a much different world if that theory had prevailed in the Supreme Court, rather than Justice O’Connor’s view in Hamdi? Ms. NOLAN. Absolutely, and I think the electronic surveillance is a perfect example of this theory going to the next step, which it is based on this unitary Executive theory and the commander-in-chief power. But the theater of war now is the entire world, including the United States, and the end of the war may be never when we are talking about the war on terror. And so we are not talking

about limited emergency Presidential powers in a very short period of time.
Senator LEAHY. We are talking about powers being used for the rest of my lifetime and your lifetime.
Ms. NOLAN. That is correct. Senator LEAHY. And if I might, because the time is limited—and I would like to pursue that because I think you are absolutely right. If we say it is a war on terror, nations have faced terrorist threats throughout their history. Look at Europe, look at other countries. Do we set aside our Constitution on the claim that we may face these threats? Professor Tribe, you and I have talked about a number of issues over the years, and I appreciate all the help you have given both me and this Committee. Last month, we passed a McCain amendment that prohibited inhumane, degrading treatment of detainees by U.S. personnel under all circumstances, which was originally strongly, strongly opposed by the administration; the White House’s polling and published polling showed that their opposition was not a sustainable position. They worked out a deal with Senator McCain, and the President, with great fanfare, signed the McCain amendment into law, but, of course, then very quietly issued a statement, in effect, construing what the law was and exempting or carving out an exemption for the Executive. Now, let’s say there was a violation brought before the courts on the McCain amendment prohibiting cruel, inhumane and degrading conduct, and it came before a court. What weight would a court give the President’s signing statement? Would the court give equal weight to the statute overwhelming passed by Congress, signed into law by the President? Would they give equal weight to that as they would to this signing statement by the President which carved out exceptions to the law? Mr. TRIBE. Senator, under current law, a clear majority of the Supreme Court and most circuit courts would say that although in cases of ambiguity the understanding of the President of the law’s meaning at the time it is signed might be a factor to consider, when, as in this case, the law was clear, or as clear as one can be in talking about gradations of methods of interrogation, the McCain law, the statute and the Levin-Graham compromise, or whichever way it was sequenced, is the law. And the statement made by the President of the United States on December 30 of 2005 that this will be enforced by the President only in accord with his power over the unitary Executive, a phrase that is constantly used by this administration, and when that was understood to mean that he will decide in his unfettered discretion when the method of interrogation crosses the McCain line and is cruel and inhumane, that will be given no weight. But there is no way, consistent with his expressed beliefs, that a Justice Alito could go along with that view; that is, under his view, which would be, I think, quite similar to the view of Justice Thomas dissenting in Hamdi, it is up to the President to decide how he will, through his subordinates in the unitary Executive branch, carry out his authority as commander in chief, especially given the authorization for the use of military force.

721
And it is interesting that when asked by Senator Durbin about the role of the unitary Executive theory in Hamdi, which goes directly to the question whether American citizens could be detained indefinitely or made subject to eavesdropping under the broad authority of the authorization for the use of military force notwithstanding FISA, he said, well, I am not sure that Justice Thomas referred to the unitary Executive theory. Well, in fact, he did. Just read his opinion.
He relies heavily on and names—he says because the unitary Executive must have discretion to decide how to carry out the war, it is his views that will prevail. But it would not be on the theory that the President’s understanding of the law trumps Congress’s intent. It would rather be on the theory that the President has unfettered power to control the entire executive branch within the reach of his authority.
Now, let me, if I might, just say why this distinction between scope, the reach of his authority, and control is not a coherent one. Yes, it is true that the unitary Executive theory would not suddenly add to the executive branch a distinct lump of law-making powers. For example, the power that Truman exercised in the steel crisis; the President couldn’t suddenly, under the unitary Executive theory, gain the power of eminent domain.
But the President does have the power to disregard Acts of Congress that would impinge on his carrying out of an executive function. And under the views that were expressed by Judge Alito in his testimony and the views that were really the underpinning of the unitary Executive theory when it was cooked up on a creative storm in the Office of Legal Counsel in the period when Judge Alito was there, the underpinnings included the notion that the President has inherent power over foreign affairs, war-making and the executive.
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Tribe, we are way over time on this section. If you could wrap up that answer—
Mr. TRIBE. It is wrapped up. Chairman SPECTER.—I want to be deferential to Senator Leahy, who has a followup. This is not a precedent now. Senator LEAHY. No, no, no, that is OK. Actually, my followup was going to go into this subject, so I was interested in the answer. Chairman SPECTER. OK, if you are sure. Senator Hatch. Senator LEAHY. Thank you. Thank you very much, Professor Tribe. Senator HATCH. Well, I have to apologize to this brilliant panel because I was not here. I was down at the Blair House with the Chancellor of Germany that I needed to do, and I have respect for all of you. I just have one question. Maybe, Professor Fried, you could assist me with this. Could you please—you know, we have had some difference of opinion as to what settled law is in this body. A common question to ask is do you believe Roe v. Wade is settled law or any number of other opinions as well. Professor Fried, could you explain the difference between settled law and settled precedent? Because, as I heard both of the—as I heard both now-Chief Justice Roberts and Sam Alito, Judge Alito,
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00733 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.004 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

722
they basically both said that they believe that Roe v. Wade and a number of other cases are settled precedents.
Now, I think what I would like you to do is could you please explain the terms ‘‘settled law’’ and ‘‘settled precedent’’ so that we all understand it once and for all, and whether the two witnesses, now-Chief Justice Roberts when he was Judge Roberts and Judge Alito, whether they were consistent in their answers on that particular issue.
Mr. FRIED. I am afraid I am unable to say what the difference between settled law and settled precedent is. I think that came out during the very excellent questioning by Senator Feinstein, and Judge Alito’s answers, I think, were admirable.
Chief Justice Roberts answered Senator Feinstein and came up with the statement of settled law, settled precedent. I don’t think that there was an attempt to make some distinction between those two concepts. But what he was suggesting is that this is something that is so well understood that it would be really extremely disruptive and unfortunately disruptive to overrule it.
Now, Judge Alito—I am sorry. This was taken by members of this body and in the press as an absolute commitment how Judge Roberts would vote. I don’t believe he meant it as that. And Judge Alito, to his credit, when he was asked that question, was so scrupulous about giving a commitment, which he absolutely must not do, and which I don’t think any member of this panel would want him to do, to make a commitment, that he avoided a formulation which had come to be made the equivalent of commitment, of an oath that I shall never do that. No judge, no person who aspires to be on a court, should ever make a commitment about how he or she will vote. I think you all agree with that. And I think Judge Alito, though it is causing trouble for him and will cause trouble for him, was unwilling to enter that territory because of his very admirable scrupulousness.
Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to clarify that, and I think that does clarify that, because that is the way I interpreted it as well. But thank you for answering that.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. To come back to this unitary Executive, Judge Alito was asked frequently about his view about this and also about its impact upon the administrative agencies. And he responded during the course of the hearings that the Humphrey’s Executor and Morrison cases upheld the powers of Congress to create the independent agencies and tried to leave it at that. Of course, what is enormously interesting was his statement that his dissent in the Morrison case, where he took exception to Morrison, he says, ‘‘But perhaps the Morrison decision can be read in a way that heeds if not the constitutional text that I mentioned, at least the objectives for setting up a unitary Executive that could lead to a fairly strong degree of Presidential control over the work of the administrative agencies in the areas of policymaking.’’ So this is his view. We would appreciate an understanding what the law is. I think Professor Tribe indicated what he thought would be the decision. But this is his view.
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00734 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.004 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

723
And then in his work at the Justice Department at OLC on signing statements—and I will include the appropriate paragraph, but let me just in the issue of time mention his statement here. ‘‘Since the President’s approval is just as important as that of the House or Senate, it seems to follow that the President’s understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress.’’ That is rather, at least for me, and I think for most legislators, a bizarre concept. I thought we were the legislative branch.
But then he continues: ‘‘From the perspective of the executive branch, the issue of the interpretive signing statements would have two chief advantages: first, it would increase the power of the Executive to shape the law’’—‘‘increase the power of the Executive to shape the law; and, second, by forcing some rethinking by courts, scholars, and litigants, it may help to curb the prevalent abuses of legislative history.’’
The question is, Are we talking about someone that has a different understanding of the balance between the Executive and the Congress and the judiciary in terms of the makings of law? It seems to me that this is an attempt to tip the—to change that balance and tip it more towards the Executive at a time when we have certainly the challenges that are out here before the country to make it fairer, more equitable, to deal with the problems and challenges that we are facing in the country in terms of opportunity. Professor Tribe?
Mr. TRIBE. Well, I think I would underscore one aspect of what you were quoting, Senator Kennedy. Those statements that were made by Judge Alito about how he understands and how he believes one could shape the relationship among the branches of Government after Morrison, which was the decision upholding the validity of the independent counsel law and the decision rejecting Congress’s—sort of rejecting the attack on Congress’s role with respect to the Executive.
When Judge Alito made those statements, he was not working for the Government. He was not speaking in some other role. He was a judge. He had been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for about 10 years. The statement was made on November 17, 2000, to a gathering of the Federalist Society, obviously a group exercising considerable influence with what was then the likely new administration. That was 10 days after the votes were counted in the election of 2000. It was 10 days after now-President Bush had declared victory even though the recounts were going on.
So he was speaking to the decisionmakers who would perhaps decide—he was already discussed as a possible nominee to the Supreme Court—who would decide whether he would remain on the Third Circuit. And he was saying to that group, ‘‘I still believe in what we were arguing back in 1986 at OLC.’’ He talks about the ‘‘Gospel according to OLC.’’ He says, ‘‘I still believe in that gospel.’’ He is speaking as a judge, and he says, ‘‘Under that gospel, we have a way of giving the President more power.’’
I cannot imagine more direct evidence— Senator KENNEDY. I am sorry to interrupt you, but I have very brief time. Just how would that change the relationship between the Executive and Congress?

724
Mr. TRIBE. Well, it would make it much harder for Congress to say you cannot interfere with the SEC in the following way, you cannot override the directives of the Fed. Even the independence of the Federal Reserve Board, which could be distinguished on grounds that historically monetary control was outside the Executive power, but that is shaky ground when you believe in the full unitary Executive. In theory, it could take over the conduct of all of the agencies because there are only three branches of Government, and they belong in the Executive.
Senator KENNEDY. My time is up, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. The Committee is going to break very briefly for the memorial service for David Rosenbaum, which is being held at 10:30 in this building. A number of members of the Committee have expressed an interest in going there. I do not intend to stay for the full ceremony. I will be back. Others may stay longer. But I just wanted to point that out, and we will be breaking at about 10:20 or so. Now, Senator Sessions? Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, could I just ask unanimous consent to place in the records several news articles regarding this whole issue? Chairman SPECTER. Without objection, they will be made a part of the record. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Professor Demleitner, I found your comments insightful, and from your perspective, as you said, a left-leaning Democrat, an ACLU member, and who worked at the Criminal Justice Clinic while you were at Yale. And you told the story about being with Judge Alito as his clerk, and you saw something that concerned you in an opinion, and you asked him about it and he took the transcript home that night to read it. Would you share briefly how that came about and what that meant to you as a young law clerk? Ms. DEMLEITNER. Of course. I would be happy to. Thank you for asking, Senator. I think it was in the fall of my clerkship, and as you said correctly, I had worked in the prison clinic at Yale, and obviously it was representing prison inmates, and so I had a very pro-defense outlook, which I think I still have today. And so clerking for a former Federal prosecutor was somewhat—I guess I was somewhat apprehensive about that. But from the very first day on, I think Judge Alito made it very clear that he wanted to hear all kinds of arguments, and I was, I think, generally inclined to argue to him that he should vote to reverse convictions. There was one particular case that I remember very distinctly. It was a bribery case, and I had read the record, I had read the lower court transcript, and I thought there was some reason why he should vote to reverse. And, you know, I think a lot of other judges would have said, No, I don’t see it, and just left it at that. He took the entire lower court record home, took my memo home, and the next morning, when he came back, it was very clear he had spent quite a bit of time with it. He had read it. He had digested it. He sat me down and explained to me why I was wrong. He was right.

But I was so impressed with it because he didn’t just laugh, you know, this is one of Nora’s other theories to set someone free, but he really took it seriously. And he did this with every single case.
So I actually wanted to respectfully disagree with Professor Tribe on this issue because I think collegiality, brilliance, listening to others, which Professor Kronman had talked about, are very important on a court that consists of only nine members, because I think it shows he will be open minded, he will listen. He always listens, and I think that is very important, and he can be moved. I mean I remember writing memos to him and discussing cases with him where I saw this is his position, and he came out of oral argument and came out of the bench meeting with the judges afterwards, and he had changed his mind. So he has not said he is nondoctrinaire, and I think that is important to know about him.
Senator SESSIONS. That is consistent with what his colleagues on the bench have said, that is for sure. You mentioned the Rybar case. I agree with you on that, and in fact, in that case he ruled for the little guy against the prosecutors and the Government, who wanted to put the man in jail. He threw out the conviction. People have forgotten that in the course of the discussions.
Ms. Nolan, I remember you served as legal counsel in the opportunities that we had to chat, and you point out that you believe it is essential to defend the power of the President to undertake his constitutional assigned responsibilities, whether considering the exercise of his powers under the Appointments Clause or under the Commander-in-Chief Clause. You had to do that in that position in Department of Justice. You note that: In my view the executive branch is right to resist inappropriate incursions on its power from the legislative and judicial branches, and we should thus expect that executive branch lawyers will strongly defend Executive powers.
Just briefly, before we get into some of my questions, Congress is never reluctant to expand its power, and oftentimes to diminish Executive power, and it is a constant tension there, is it not, from your perspective? You served on the President Clinton—
Ms. NOLAN. There is definitely a tension. I do think Congress is sometimes reluctant, but there is definitely a tension.
Senator SESSIONS. Professor Fried, most of us, I think, are not familiar with this idea of unitary Executive. I have heard it complained for many years—and I assume this is the genesis of it— that these ABC agencies, these alphabetical entities that are quasi a part of the executive branch, but nobody controls them, is somehow contrary to our three branches of Government concept, and you have served in the Department of Justice, you have been Solicitor General, you are now a professor of law. Could you share with us the tensions that might exist and how we might think about these issues?
Mr. FRIED. I would be glad to, but only if the Chairman will give me the time.
Chairman SPECTER. Professor Fried, to the extent you can, would you make it brief?
Mr. FRIED. I have a talent for making things brief. [Laughter.]

726
Mr. FRIED. Yes. First of all, Morrison v. Olson, the independent counsel case, was the crucial case on the unitary Executive. It was my bitter experience to have argued that case and lost it 7–1. I always tell my class that if that had come up later and had been styled ‘‘Clinton against Starr’’, I would have won it, because by then it became perfectly obvious what an abomination that Independent Counsel Law was, how it had been misused, and how it tore the fabric of our constitutional system.
I think what has been said about the unitary Executive in these hearings is very misleading. The unitary Executive says nothing at all, nothing about whether the President must obey the law. It talks about the President’s power to control the executive branch. That is the subject. And in this, the unitary Executive theory is not an invention of the Reagan Justice Department or the Office of Legal Counsel, it was propounded in the first administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who objected to the powers of the Controller General, who tried to fire a Federal trade commissioner, and who referred to himself as the general manager of the executive branch. That is the origin of the notion in FDR’s administration.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Fried, and thank you, Senator Sessions.
I had asked you to be brief because Senator Feinstein wants to question before our break, and that is imminent.
Senator Feinstein? Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much. I would like to quickly go down the line and ask each witness which present or past justice do you think Judge Alito will most be like, please? If you do not, Dr. Chemerinsky, we will come back. Do you have a view? Mr. CHEMERINSKY. Sure. Your Honor, having read over 200 opinions written by Judge Alito, I think ideologically he is closest on the current Court to Justice Scalia, which, of course, is exactly what President Bush said he wanted in appointing a Justice to the Court. Mr. KRONMAN. I would name Justice John Harlan, who Judge Alito identified as one of his four heroes on the Supreme Court. Ms. NOLAN. I think it is likely to be Justice Scalia, although I think he may be more aggressive on Executive power than Justice Scalia has been in all areas. Mr. FRIED. It is certainly not Justice Scalia, because he has not sworn allegiance to any of the theology which Justice Scalia has propounded, never on any occasion. I think it is Robert Jackson. Mr. TRIBE. I only wish it were Jackson or Harlan. I think he would be—I do not know that I accept the question as being sort of directly— Senator FEINSTEIN. You do not have to answer if you do not have— Mr. TRIBE. I would not mind answering. I think he is somewhere— [Laughter.] Mr. TRIBE [continuing]. Between Scalia and Thomas, and I could explain the differences, but I do not think he is anything like Jackson or Harlan. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you.

Mr. Fried, I listened to your testimony on Justice Roberts with great interest. In a dialog you had with Senator Specter, I want to quote what you said. You said, talking about Roe, ‘‘It is not only that it’s been reaffirmed as to abortion, but that it has ramified, it has struck roots, so it has been cited and used in the Lawrence case . . . in some of the opinions in the right-to-die cases, in the Troxel case, which is the grandparent visiting right case. So it is not only that it is there and it is a big tree, but it has ramified and exfoliated, and it would be an enormous disruption. So you not only get branches, you get leaves.’’
And then you went on to say, ‘‘Since I do not know Judge Roberts except most casually, and I certainly have never discussed it, if you want a prediction from me, I would predict that he would never vote—not never—but he would not vote to overrule it for the reasons that I have given.’’
Would you make the same prediction about Judge Alito? Mr. FRIED. I would, and I should say that after Judge Alito left my office, which was late in 1985, I think I have spoken to him three times, and then maybe 15 words. So it is a guess there as it was with Roberts, but, yes, that would be my prediction. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you. Now, my question of anyone who would care to answer is about the value of a Presidential signing statement. If it is true—and it is—that the legislature passes legislation, makes findings of fact, that legislative intent is generally based on those who formulate the legislation and pass it, does a Presidential signing statement shape the law? Mr. FRIED. I think that this has been much misunderstood here too. The Presidential Signing Statement Initiative, which I was involved in, I must say, was principally devised to curb the abuses of legislative history and legislative reports in which staff often— and I am afraid we continue to see that—with the assistance of outside groups and lobbyists—different groups, different lobbyists— but with their assistance, plant little stink bombs in the legislative history, which then flower in later litigation. [Laughter.] Mr. FRIED. The point of the signing statement was, if you like, a kind of Airwick against those stink bombs. [Laughter.] Senator FEINSTEIN. You have aroused the staff. Mr. TRIBE. There may be a lot of staff-oriented stink bombs, but the power to inject a poison pill in the legislation is what we see in the Signing Statement Initiative. And whatever was the original intent under Charles’s tutelage, what has happened under the current administration is totally different. There are something like 100 examples now of references in these signing statements to the unitary Executive, and they are being used, they are being used to give the President the kind of control that not only FDR, but all the way back to George Washington you can find examples of the President saying, ‘‘I am the President. This is my Government.’’ But it is a big fallacy to say, as my friend Charles Fried did, that this has nothing to do with the power of Congress. Congress often enacts legislation to structure the executive branch and to limit the power of the President as the head of the branch, to tell the limbs

of that tree that Charles described, and the leaves, exactly what to do.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Feinstein. Senator FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. We are going to adjourn for a— Senator COBURN. Senator Specter, I will defer my questions so that we will not have to have the panel come back, if that would be OK, and I will submit some questions. Chairman SPECTER. You are entitled to your round. Senator COBURN. But I think in all courtesy to our distinguished panel, this would release them, and I will be happy to submit some questions for the record. Chairman SPECTER. All right. We will proceed in that manner at your suggestion. As I had said earlier, New York Times reporter, David Rosenbaum, a memorial service is being held for him. he was brutally murdered on the streets of Washington very recently. We will recess for just a few moments. I would like the next panel to be ready and the Senators to be ready. [Recess at 10:05 a.m. to 10:40 a.m.] Chairman SPECTER. The hearing will resume. The first witness on our next panel, Panel 5, is Mr. Fred Gray, senior partner at Gray, Langford, Sapp, McGowan, Gray & Nathanson, a veteran civil rights attorney with an extraordinary record of representation. At the age of 24, he represented Ms. Rosa Parks, whose involvement in the historic refusal to give up her seat on the bus to a white man is so well known. That action initiated the Montgomery bus boycott. He was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s first civil rights lawyer. In 2004, Mr. Gray received the ABA Thurgood Marshall Award for his contributions to civil rights. A graduate of National Christian Institute, Alabama State University, and Case Western Reserve. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Gray. I haven’t had an indication from Senator Leahy about whom they would like to give extra time to, but my sense is that you would be on the list, so we are going to set the clock at 10 minutes for you. You may proceed.
STATEMENT OF FRED D. GRAY, SENIOR PARTNER, GRAY, LANGFORD, SAPP, MCGOWAN, GRAY & NATHANSON, TUSKEGEE, ALABAMA
Mr. GRAY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. By way of explanation, the judges talked longer yesterday, and I thought it appropriate not to interrupt them, and I want to give the extra time to this panel. If Senator Leahy comes in and cuts you off, Mr. Gray, just remember I gave you 10 minutes. [Laughter.] Mr. GRAY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And to my Senator, Senator Sessions, who represents us well in the Senate, to the other members of the Committee, of course, I am Fred Gray. I live in Tuskegee, Alabama, with offices there and in Montgomery. I appreciate this Committee inviting me to appear. I consider it an honor.

For over 50 years, I have filed almost every imaginable type civil rights case in Alabama. Many of those cases have resulted in Supreme Court rulings and many of them precedent-setting cases in which the Court declared unconstitutional certain State and city ordinances, including in the field of registration and reapportionment.
As one who has been in the trenches and still is in the trenches, I appear today to attest to the tremendous importance of the reapportionment cases, those cases decided by the Warren Court, one of which I actually litigated and was my brainchild, the case of Gomillion v. Lightfoot.
I am still troubled, extremely troubled by Judge Alito’s comments made in his application, notwithstanding the testimony before this Committee. The reapportionment cases decided by the Warren Court made certain that the Federal courts had the power to ensure that voting rights were meaningfully protected. These rights had been violated by many of our States since Reconstruction. The cases illuminate the inequities of malapportionment which deprived African-Americans of voting strength across the Nation. In my view, there is no more important body of law than that generated in the field of voter registration and in civil and human rights.
African-Americans in Alabama and other Southern States for years, even before Browder v. Gayle, which is the case that integrated the buses and which was a unanimous case of the Warren Court, were actively working toward obtaining the right to vote. For example, in my hometown now, Tuskegee, Alabama, the home of Tuskegee University where Booker T. Washington was its first president, where George Washington Carver made many of his scientific discoveries, and the home of the Tuskegee Airmen, AfricanAmericans in that county filed lawsuits as far back as 1945 in order to obtain the right to vote.
After years of litigation, when we were finally able to get approximately 400 African-Americans registered for an upcoming municipal election, in 1957 the Alabama Legislature passed a law which changed the city limits of the city of Tuskegee from a square to a 26-side figure, excluding all but three or four African-Americans and leaving all the whites in the city. And then the State said, ‘‘We are not denying you the right to vote. We are simply changing the political boundaries of the city of Tuskegee, and you cannot vote now in the city elections because you are no longer there.’’ I thought that was wrong, and so did the Supreme Court. We filed the case of Gomillion v. Lightfoot. That case substantially strengthened the law in securing the right to vote for African-Americans.
The Gomillion case was the first significant reapportionment case decided by the Warren Court. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that the boundary change violated the 15th Amendment. Just as importantly, the Court rejected the argument that impairment of voting rights could not be challenged in the face of a State’s unrestricted power to realign its political subdivisions. The Court stated: ‘‘When a legislature thus singles out a readily isolated segment of a racial minority for special discriminatory treatment, it violates the 15th Amendment....Apart from all else, these considerations lift this controversy out of the so-called ‘polit-

ical arena’ and into the conventional sphere of constitutional litigation.’’
There is no question in my mind that it gave rise—Gomillion v. Lightfoot did—to the other subsequent cases you have heard about, great reapportionment cases, Baker v. Carr, Gray v. Sanders, Reynolds v. Sims.
I cannot overstate to this Committee the importance of these cases, for they laid the foundation for our democracy. The reapportionment cases enshrining the principle that every citizen has a right to an equally effective vote, rather than the right to simply cast a ballot. State legislatures could not dilute the votes of racial minorities by perpetuating unequal voting districts. And, most importantly, the reapportionment cases also established principles for challenges ‘‘at-large’’ and ‘‘multi-member’’ electoral systems enacted by many of the Southern States after the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
When I filed the Gomillion case, we had very few African-Americans registered to vote and had no legislators. I was one of the first two in 1970. Now Alabama has—and across the Nation there are over 9,000 registered—9,800 appointed and elected officials, and they are there because of the result of the Warren Court’s decisions in Gomillion, Baker, Gray, Reynolds, and these other cases enacted by legislation since that time. So we have these persons serving with honor and distinction, from city council to the Congress.
However, we still need a strong Supreme Court to continue to enforce these laws. I have seen in my home State, as fast as we get one law stricken, they will enact another. Now that we have a proportionate number of African-Americans in the legislature, we want to be sure that we have a strong Supreme Court that will not permit that to be changed.
I respectfully submit and suggest that this Committee carefully scrutinize Judge Alito’s disagreement with these cases. A nominee to the Supreme Court who has a judicial philosophy that is set against the Warren Court and against the reapportionment cases is, in effect, saying that he would turn the clock back. If this occurred, not only would African-Americans lose, the entire Nation would lose the great richness of their contributions as we are currently enjoying. In my opinion, a Supreme Court Justice with these views would impede instead of protecting the right to vote.
In conclusion, I submit that the next appointee to the Supreme Court should favor the protection of voting rights and should strengthen, and not weaken, the voting rights case law as developed by the Warren Court.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Gray appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Gray, and thank you for your remarkable service on civil rights and voting rights. Your listing of cases and listing of clients is enormously impressive, and it has been a great contribution to America. Mr. GRAY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER.

NARAL Pro-Choice America. Prior to joining NARAL in 1985, she was Executive Director of Planned Parenthood in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where she expanded the range of reproductive health services available in the area. She also trained medical students and residents in child development as clinical assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Pennsylvania State University School of Medicine. And it is worthy of brief comment that we two Pennsylvanians have had many discussions on this issue at the same health club. Remarkable what the health clubs will do.
Ms. MICHELMAN. We miss you. Chairman SPECTER. What is that? Ms. MICHELMAN. I said we miss you over there. Chairman SPECTER. Well, they don’t have a squash court. [Laughter.] Ms. MICHELMAN. I know that was a big mistake on their part. Chairman SPECTER. I had to change health clubs except for the Senate gym, where I see Senator Kennedy. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. What is your time— Senator KENNEDY. Can we take you up on that? Chairman SPECTER. We are going to put your time at 10 minutes, Ms. Michelman, and we look forward to your testimony.
STATEMENT OF KATE MICHELMAN, FORMER PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ABORTION AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ACTION LEAGUE (NARAL) PRO-CHOICE AMERICA, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy, who is not here, and members of the Committee, it is my pleasure to talk with you today, and I must say I am deeply honored to be sitting next to this great man, Mr. Gray.
Certainly for many days we have heard many legal experts and constitutional law theorists, but I think the voices of real people whose lives will be affected by the potential confirmation of Judge Alito have been absent from this discussion. And I am here as one woman among millions whose lives could be indelibly shaped by the confirmation of this judge.
In 1969, I was a young, stay-at-home mother of three little girls, a practicing Catholic who had accepted the church’s teachings about birth control and abortion. The notion that abortion might be an issue I would face in my own life never, ever occurred to me until the day my husband suddenly abandoned me and our family. In time, with nothing to live on, we were forced onto welfare. Soon after he left, I discovered I was pregnant. After a very long period of soul searching, of balancing my moral and religious values about the newly developing life, with my responsibility to my three young daughters, I decided to have an abortion.
I might add, Mr. Chairman, that of the countless women I have encountered throughout my life, not one has made a decision about abortion without first contemplating the gravity of that choice. Not one needed the tutelage or supervision of the State to understand her own ethical values much less to be reminded to consult them. And every single one of them deserve the respect and protection afforded by Roe v. Wade.

Now, because all of this occurred prior to Roe, I was legally prevented from acting privately on my decision. I was compelled to submit to two interrogations before an all-male panel of doctors, who probed every aspect of my private life, from my sex life with my husband, to whether I was capable of dressing my children. Eventually they gave me their permission. I was awaiting the procedure when a nurse arrived to tell me that State law imposed yet another humiliating burden. The Government required me to obtain my husband’s consent. I was forced to leave the hospital, find where he was living, and ask him to give me his permission.
Now, this was incredibly humiliating, and an experience that awakened me to a lifetime of activism. I tell you this story not to get your sympathy, I tell this story because this nomination poses a real threat that women will once again face the dreadful choice between the degradation of the Review Board and the danger of the back alley, and this is neither hyperbole nor hype. It is the simple demonstrable reality of the situation.
Predicting how any given judge will decide any given case is a Washington parlor game, in my view, that distracts from the central issue. That issue is whether we any longer will recognize limits on the Government’s authority to reach into the most intimate areas of our private lives. There is nothing in Judge Alito’s lengthy public record to suggest that he recognizes such limits for anyone, and even less so for women, and there is much in his record that indicates, I think, clearly and beyond the boundaries of reasonable dispute, that he rejects the idea of privacy, personal privacy, as a fundamental American ideal.
A woman’s right to choose is a powerful manifestation of privacy, but it is one right among many, and all of them should concern us. There is no sense in Judge Alito’s writings or rulings that privacy is a fundamental constitutional right. In his record, not only are individuals often powerless against the prerogatives of the State, individuals are more often than not simply absent all together. In many ways, what Judge Alito has written is less disturbing than what he omits, any sense of how his legal rulings bear on real people whose lives are shaped by his decisions.
When he ruled that a Pennsylvania law requiring women to notify their husbands before obtaining an abortion was not ‘‘an undue burden,’’ there was no sense that a woman like me ever existed or even mattered. When he wrote that commonly used methods of birth control could be classified as methods of abortion, there was no indication he considered the women who would be forced into unwanted pregnancies. His writings contain ample veneration for the State, but I think place little value on the individuals whom Government exists to serve, protect and respect.
I have been involved in many Supreme Court nominations, but frankly, none more important than this one, nor as dangerous, for the contrast between Judge Alito and the Justice he would replace is quite stark. As the first woman to serve on the Court, Justice O’Connor brought a very unique perspective to the law that is evident in her opinions, upholding a woman’s right to choice, protecting women from discrimination, and defending affirmative action. Quite often—you have talked about this a lot—she has been

733
the decisive vote in 5–4 cases, whose balance Judge Alito would now tip the other way.
Here, Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that Justice O’Connor is a judicial conservative, who has not always fully protected constitutional rights and liberties, but she crafted opinions that retained meaningful protections for rights that other Justices sought to deny completely.
But the most disturbing difference between these two jurists is not simply the conclusions they reach, but also how they reach them. Justice O’Connor considered each case with careful attention to what the law means and who it affects, for she knows that that is the essence of justice. In Judge Alito’s approach to the law, there is neither justice, nor regard for women’s human dignity.
Judge Alito has parried challenges to his record by promising an open mind and a respect for precedent. We must ask whether this assurance offered only now, can be allowed to outweigh the totality of this man’s record. Millions of American women whose lives, privacy and dignity have a place in this debate would have to conclude no.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Michelman appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Michelman. Our next witness is Professor Ronald Sullivan, Associate Clinical Professor of Law at Yale. He is a graduate of Morehouse College in 1989, and a law degree from Harvard in 1994. He served for 1 year in Nairobi, Kenya as a visiting attorney for the Law Society of Kenya, and in that capacity was on a committee charged with drafting a new constitution for Kenya. We very much appreciate your coming in today, Professor Sullivan, and the floor is yours, and the clock will start at 10 minutes.
STATEMENT OF RONALD S. SULLIVAN, JR., ASSOCIATE CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW, AND SENIOR FELLOW, JAMESTOWN PROJECT, YALE LAW SCHOOL, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT
Mr. SULLIVAN. Thank you very much, Senator Specter, and Senator Leahy in his absence, members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify at this very important expression of our democracy.
I have been asked to comment on Judge Alito’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Two broad themes follow from his record. First, Judge Alito’s Fourth Amendment opinions reveal a clear pattern of privileging Government power when it comes into conflict with individual liberty. Indeed, in the 17 opinions that the nominee has authored regarding the Fourth Amendment, in his more than 15 years on the bench, Judge Alito has ruled to suppress evidence only once.
The second broad theme is that Judge Alito is a skilled, legal writer with a sharp analytical mind. Almost none of his opinions appears to be a radical departure from accepted jurisprudential conventions. Rather, his constitutional criminal procedure decisions, read together, demonstrate a pattern that cannot be ignored. In over 50 constitutional criminal procedure cases that I have re-

734
viewed, Judge Alito ruled in the government’s favor over 90 percent of the time. To borrow an old phrase, as the government goes, so goes Judge Alito in a criminal law context.
But the point I make here is more than a mere statistical correlation. I want to make a deeper and more substantive point. Judge Alito’s tendency to privilege government power in a criminal context represents a failing in his jurisprudence for the following three reasons.
Number 1: Judge Alito criminal law corpus demonstrates a judicial philosophy that improperly subordinates privacy, dignity and autonomy concerns to the interest of the government.
Number 2: Even when the government undeniably violates the Fourth Amendment, Judge Alito employs legal rules to excuse the government for its misbehavior.
Number 3: Judge Alito shifts from a strict constructionist to an activist jurist at times when the government’s interest so dictates.
Let me briefly address each of these propositions in turn, and of course, I give much greater detail in my written statement. First, privacy and dignity concerns. Groody v. Doe has been discussed all week, and I assure you I shall not be redundant. Let me simply invite the Committee to read my comparison of Groody with another one of his cases, Leveto v. Lapina. In Groody, Judge Alito was only able to muster up one clause, not even a full sentence, giving voice to the highest order dignity concerns involved or implicated in the strip search of a 10-year-old girl. Compare this to Leveto, a tax evasion case involving the search of a wealthy veterinarian and his spouse, who was wearing a nightgown, where Judge Alito devotes four entire pages of text to express the ‘‘indignity’’ or ‘‘stigma’’ concerns associated with the illegal search. In no other, I repeat, no other Fourth Amendment case that Judge Alito authored, did he spend even a fraction of the time expressing the dignitary objections that he did in Leveto. One is forced to wonder whether Judge Alito has a more robust appreciation for the privacy and dignity concerns of the wealthy or the class of individuals typically charged with tax evasion or crimes of that sort.
In the area of what I have characterized as excusing governmental misbehavior, Judge Alito frequently uses the good faith exception or the qualified immunity doctrine to cure an otherwise illegal search. Indeed, in nearly one-third of his Fourth Amendment cases, Judge Alito excuses the government’s unconstitutional invasion of our privacy. Now, the insidious effect, the on-the-ground effect of the heavy reliance on the good faith exception or the qualified immunity exception is that the exceptions tend to swallow up the rule. This gives government officials the perverse incentive to knowingly violate the constitutional rights of our citizens because no practical consequences follow.
So Judge Alito’s rulings will take the following form. There was no substantive violation of the Fourth Amendment, therefore, conviction affirmed; or, yes, there was a substantive violation of the Fourth Amendment, as in the Leveto case, and it was a horrible violation, but even though there was a violation, I am going to interpose a qualified immunity defense, and the government is therefore shielded from civil liability. This form of argument can be seen throughout his jurisprudence.

735
Now to the strict constructionist argument. Judge Alito was praised by many as being a true conservative jurist, a strict constructionist, and that proposition has been almost assumed, as I have listened to the hearings this week. But that he is a strict constructionist is not true all of the time. A review of his entire criminal law jurisprudence demonstrates that Judge Alito shifts his interpretive style when necessary to rule in accord with the government’s interests.
Two of Judge Alito’s opinions illustrate my claim, Sandoval v. Reno and U.S. v. Lake. In Sandoval, Judge Alito employs a literalistic and plain meaning construction of the relevant statute to limit, to limit the scope of a defendant’s rights. There is a very technical habeas issue that I will not go into, but essentially Judge Alito said—he cited the captions in the relevance statute in bold letters and all caps twice, and said, ‘‘This is all we have to look at. This answers the question to congressional intent.’’ And that is within the norm of judicial reasoning for a strict constructionist. But he uses this interpretive style to limit the scope of a defendant’s right.
But in Lake he shifts his interpretive style and uses a broad, liberal even, statutory construction to augment the scope of government power. More specifically in Lake, Judge Alito found that a car, located the functional equivalent of a city block away from its owner and out of its owner’s eyesight, was nonetheless in the ‘‘presence of the owner.’’ To do so, Judge Alito relied on a Ninth Circuit, yes, a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling to articulate a remarkably broad definition of ‘‘presence.’’ This sort of shifting jurisprudence begins to look like it is result driven and not restrained in the jurisprudential tradition in which Judge Alito positions himself.
We are living in a moment where the Executive is making extraordinary claims of authority to conduct investigations of U.S. citizens. The delicate balance between liberty and safety that the Framers fought so hard to erect, and that their successor generations fought so hard to maintain, needs our continued vigilance to sustain.
In the United States perhaps no right is regarded as more sacred, more worthy of vigilant protection, than the right of each and every individual to be free from government intrusion without the unquestionable authority of the law. Judge Alito, on my read of his constitutional criminal procedure opinions, shows an inadequate consideration for the important values that underwrite these norms of individual liberty, the very norms upon which this constitutional democracy relies for its sustenance. This Committee and this Committee’s decision on whether to consent to Judge Alito’s nomination will have a profound impact on how liberty is realized in the United States.
In addition to Judge Alito’s constitutional criminal procedure decisions, I have reviewed nearly 415 of Judge Alito’s opinions under both the auspices of the Alito Project at Yale, where a number of my colleagues and I reviewed all 415 of his opinions, and under the auspices of the Jamestown Project at Yale, where I serve as a Senior Fellow. While I have not studied in detail all 415 of his opinions—and I should say the opinions that he authored, which I

found to be most instructive—I find this tendency to be consistent with other areas of the law as well.
That said, I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to share my remarks with you, and I look forward to answering any questions that the Committee may have.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Sullivan appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Sullivan. We now turn to Professor Amanda Frost, Assistant Professor of Law at American University’s Washington College of Law. She is a graduate of Harvard College, 1993, with a bachelor’s degree and a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1997. Her areas of specialization include civil procedure in Federal courts, and is the author of several Law Review articles. As staff attorney for the Public Citizen’s Litigation Group, she has litigated cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and Federal Courts of Appeals. She was a consultant for the Shanghai Municipal Government in drafting open government legislation. Thank you for being with us today, Professor Frost, and we will set the clock at 10 minutes for your testimony.
STATEMENT OF AMANDA FROST, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF LAW, WASHINGTON COLLEGE OF LAW, AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Ms. FROST. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Senator Leahy and members of the Committee, I feel honored to have the opportunity to testify at these important proceedings. My comments today are about reforms that are needed, and the procedures and practices that govern recusal of Federal judges.
Your consideration of Judge Alito may be affected by your views about whether he should have recused himself from certain cases while sitting on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. That is why I wanted to discuss with you today certain problematic recusal practices that too often have led Federal judges into situations into which their recusal decisions undermine the public faith in the judiciary.
Because the reputation of the judiciary is affected as much by the appearance as the reality of bias, Congress has enacted a statute, 28 USC section 455, that provides, ‘‘Any justice, judge or magistrate judge of the United States, shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.’’ By using this language, Congress sought to ensure that even when a judge is certain that he or she could be impartial, that judge must step aside if members of the public might reasonably disagree.
In essence, the law requires a judge to recuse even in borderline cases in which the possibility of bias or appearance of bias is slight.
I think this is a good standard, but a key problem with the statute is that it contains no procedural mechanisms to govern the recusal decision. It does not say how the parties are to seek recusal, does not say how evidence about a judge’s potential biases or conflicts are to be shared with the parties, does not clarify who should make the recusal decision, or whether that person should articulate any reasons for making that decision.

737
So, for example, Supreme Court Justices recuse themselves in dozens of cases a year, and they almost never explain why they are doing so. When a party files a motion seeking a Justice’s recusal, which is a rare event and something that most parties would be reluctant to do, there is no formal process through which the entire Court considers and decides that motion. Instead, it is sent to the one Justice whose impartiality is being questioned, and that Justice makes the decision on his or her own, often without explanation.
This procedural vacuum has, I believe, been the cause for recurring controversies over judges’ failures to recuse, controversies that undermine the very goal of section 455 to protect the integrity of the judicial branch.
I want to give just a few examples of some of the recusal problems that have occurred over many years. In 1969, Supreme Court nominee Clement Haynsworth failed to be confirmed for that position, in part due to revelations that while sitting on the Fourth Circuit he had sat on a number of cases in which he had a small financial interest.
In 1972, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist was criticized for sitting and hearing a case that he had commented on publicly while he was in the Department of Justice.
In 2004, most of us remember, Justice Scalia made a controversial decision not to recuse himself from a case in which Vice President Cheney was a party, despite having vacationed with the Vice President shortly after the Supreme Court had agreed to hear the case.
And then most recently, Judge Samuel Alito has been questioned by this Committee for his failure to recuse himself from a case in which Vanguard was a party, despite the fact that he owned mutual funds with Vanguard, and as stated in his 1990 Judiciary Committee questionnaire that he would recuse himself from all such cases.
What everyone’s views are about whether the individual judges and Justices in these examples should have recused themselves— and I recognize there is differences of opinion on that—but whatever your views are, I think most would agree that the process by which that decision was made did not work to foster public confidence in the judiciary. These problems with the recusal law are particularly evident and disturbing at the Supreme Court level. When a district court judge or circuit court judge fails to recuse themselves, that decision may be reviewed by a higher court.
As I said, when a Supreme Court Justice faces a question of recusal, the Justice makes the decision on his or her own and there is obviously going to be no review of that decision. There is no higher court.
Furthermore, the stakes are simply that much higher at the Supreme Court, which hears the most divisive and important cases and which sets the law for the Nation.
Finally, the Supreme Court is the public face of the judiciary, and because of this, their recusal practices are more likely to have a negative effect on the public’s perception of the Judiciary.
I propose a series of procedural reforms that could be made either by the Justices themselves in a rule, or by Congress, by
VerDate 0ct 09 2002 10:43 Feb 24, 2006 Jkt 025429 PO 00000 Frm 00749 Fmt 6601 Sfmt 6601 S:\GPO\HEARINGS\25429T.004 SJUD4 PsN: CMORC

738
amending the recusal laws. First, there should be more transparency. Judges should be required to inform the parties and the public of any information that would be relevant to the recusal question. Even if they do not think recusal is required, the parties should be given full information, and the public as well.
Second, when judges do decide to recuse themselves, they should at least issue a brief explanation explaining why. That will provide a body of precedent to guide future litigants and judges facing these difficult recusal situations.
And third, when a judge does not decide or does not think it is clear that he should recuse himself, that judge should turn that decision over to his colleagues, or at the very least consult his colleagues, rather than make the decision on his own.
With these reforms in place, I think we would better protect both the reputation of the judiciary and of the judges who serve the public.
Thank you for inviting me to share my views with you today. [The prepared statement of Ms. Frost appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Frost. We now turn to Professor John Flym, professor of law at Northwestern. He has taught Professional Responsibility and Advanced Criminal Procedure. He served as counsel to Ms. Shantee Maharaj, the plaintiff in the 2002 case where Judge Alito ruled in favor of the Vanguard Mutual Fund. He got his bachelor’s degree from Columbia in 1961 and his law degree from Harvard. Thank you for agreeing to be a witness here today, Professor Flym, and we look forward to your testimony.

I would like to make one correction, if you please. It is a common error, but I have taught at Northeastern University, which is in Boston.
I am indeed the lawyer who challenged Judge Alito’s failure to recuse in the Monga case, the Monga/Vanguard case.
What I would like to do now is to address three points, one of which was particularly addressed by Senator Hatch yesterday in his questioning of John Payton, the Eighth Federal Circuit representative. Does the law require Judge Alito to recuse given his investments in Vanguard?
Now, my colleague Amanda Frost addressed Provision (a) of the statute, which speaks in general terms and states the general principle based on the appearance. A judge shall recuse if someone could reasonably question the judge’s impartiality. Section (b), however, is the applicable provision. Section (b) doesn’t state a general proposition. It states a specific proposition. Among them (b)(4) says that a judge shall recuse if the judge has a financial interest in a party to the case. It then goes on in subsection (d) to define what ‘‘financial interest’’ means, and it says a financial interest means

a financial interest, ‘‘however small,’’ and then it goes on to list the various exceptions.
Now, Judge Alito in his answers filed in the questionnaire which he submitted to this Committee relies on the third exception in subsection (d), the one which plainly has nothing whatsoever to do with mutual funds. It has to do with interests, for example, in insurance policies. The one exception that does address mutual funds is the one raised by Senator Hatch, but it says the opposite of what Senator Hatch suggested yesterday. It says that one of the exceptions is that an investment in a mutual fund shall not be regarded as a financial interest in the securities held in the fund’s portfolio. Now, that is an obvious proportion. It has nothing whatsoever to do with simply saying that an investment in mutual funds doesn’t qualify as an interest, as a financial interest within the meaning of subsection (b), because if it did, Congress would simply have defined what—it would simply have said in the exceptions that financial interest doesn’t include an investment in a mutual fund. That is what the statute says.
Now, the statute goes back to 1974. It would be astonishing if there weren’t interpretations, case law of the statute. There are lots of interpretations. The Second Circuit in 2002, that is, the year before Judge Alito wrote the December 10th letter to Judge Scirica saying, ‘‘After I received the November 2003 motion that I should have recused myself, I reviewed the law, and having reviewed the law, I concluded that the statute doesn’t require me to recuse. But, nevertheless, I am going to do that so that you can appoint a panel to consider the pending motion.’’ He did not recuse from the case. A more important detail than might otherwise appear.
Now, in his statement to this Committee, his reliance on the third exception for insurance policies is unexplainable. It is incoherent. It has nothing whatsoever to do with mutual funds. The first exception, with due respect to Senator Hatch, says the opposite of what the Senator suggested yesterday. It says mutual funds do count as financial interests. These simply do not include investments that the fund makes in the securities, that is, the securities which are listed in the fund’s portfolio.
Now, I, like everyone else, have been enormously impressed by all of the testimony, particularly his colleagues and everyone who has worked with judges, that he is a brilliant man, that he studies the law very carefully, that he pays particular attention to the arguments presented to him because he is a fair-minded man.
Now, at the time that he wrote this letter, he had the benefit of the motion, which included everything that I have just told you, including the case law and the analysis, and a lot more. It is inconceivable to me that he could have made the statement that he made in his letter to Judge Scirica and in his questionnaire to this Committee.
I will now move on to a second point. The second point is part of what he testified to. He said that he is—and I think this was in response to the question by Senator Kennedy: ‘‘And I am one of those judges that you described who take recusal very, very seriously.’’ Is that a credible statement?
He also says that it never crossed his mind that there was a recusal issue when he looked at the Vanguard case. The name

‘‘Vanguard’’ is plastered all over the documents. We are talking about literally dozens and maybe hundreds of references to Vanguard, including in the opinion that he himself authored.
He made a pledge to this Committee in 1990, which I assume he did after reading and understanding what the 1974 recusal statute said, he continued to invest in Vanguard over the years and watched his investments grow into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. I have heard estimates that run way beyond the $370,000 which has been mentioned here. And while he was sitting on the appeal in the Vanguard case, he continued to make investments, both before and after the opinion.
Now, I would like now to move to a third point, which I consider to be perhaps most important in a sense—not most important, but just as important. I spent 40 years of my professional life representing the little guy. My client, Ms. Maharaj, exemplifies the little guy. She has nothing, not one penny. All she had was the IRA which, by law, passed to her at the death of her husband in 1996.
Now, that IRA is supposed to be sacrosanct. The Supreme Court has held in a trilogy, beginning with Guidry in the 1980s, Patterson in 1992, and most recently, Rousey in 2005, that creditors can’t reach IRAs.
Now, just as has been suggested with respect to how the Roe decision may be undone through small, creative exceptions to that ruling, likewise here what the judge did—and I am confident that he did read the record and that he understood all too well what was at stake—was go out of his way on the most dubious of legal principles to rely on the supposed decision of the Massachusetts court, which, in fact, is on appeal—I argued the appeal in October. There is no decision yet. We don’t know how the Massachusetts court will decide. But all of the law which I set out in my motion makes it clear that he had no business relying on that Massachusetts decision.
What that means is that, with respect to IRAs only, never mind the other forms of retirement savings, 40-plus million Americans with their savings in IRAs, with more than $2.3 trillion in those IRAs, could see the security in what they thought were sacrosanct savings beyond the reach of any creditors, no qualification, as the Patterson court said in 1992, all of a sudden threatened the same way that the employees of IBM suddenly woke up to discover that their pensions were pretty much smoke and mirrors.
Thank you very much, members of the Committee. I realize that I spoke with some passion. I had promised myself to be calm and collected, but I confess that unless—but for the fact that President Bush nominated Judge Alito, no one would ever have heard of Ms. Maharaj or the Vanguard case and Judge Alito’s role in it.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Flym appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Flym. Mr. Gray, beginning my 5 minutes of questioning with the issue of voting rights, which you have testified about so eloquently, are you at all comforted by Judge Alito’s statement that the principle of one person/one vote is firmly embedded in the law of the land and he will follow that?

Mr. GRAY. Well, I am still troubled by the fact. I am glad to hear that. And if what that means is that if he is confirmed he will be the type of Justice protecting civil rights and human rights that Hugo Black did when he was on the Court, then I would be happy to have him serve. But I don’t remember—and I think the first time I recall that he made this statement is after it was raised in these hearings.
I would think if he was sincere about it, realizing what he had said in 1985, that he would have disclosed the fact that, ‘‘I said that then, but my position now is entirely different,’’ and would have been rather candid upright before the matter was raised, I am troubled that we would even have a nominee who would have to explain this. Because if these rights are so embedded, then there should never have been any statement the way it was in the first place.
Chairman SPECTER. Ms. Michelman, on the Roe issue, which is a matter of enormous importance, I started my questioning of Judge Alito with that subject, as I did with Chief Justice Roberts. And we have had the examples of Justice O’Connor, who was against abortion rights before she came to the Court, and Justice Kennedy against abortion rights, and a lot of worry about Justice Souter. And you have the political process where the judicial appointments are part of the process. And you heard Judge Alito talk about the precedents and the culture of the country and being embedded and a living document, which is very different from what some others have testified to in recent times.
You have watched this situation very closely, and you have noted who some of the other prospective nominees are, at least reported. If Judge Alito is rejected, what do you think the prospects are of getting a nominee whom you like better?
Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, Senator, it is true that the President won the election and he has the right to nominate Justices who share his values and his views. He made it very clear that his model Justices were Scalia and Thomas, whose views about women’s constitutional legal rights, including the right to choose, are a danger to American women and to their lives and their health and their dignity. So he has that right, but you share a co-equal responsibility, and the American public, the individuals in this Nation have only a voice in this process through you. And I would answer you by saying that I think every nominee has to be evaluated on his or her merits, on his or her record, on his or her views, judicial and philosophical views included. And we have to take one at a time. And if that nominee’s record is clearly a danger to the constitutional and fundamental rights of the American people, then I think that nominee should be defeated, and we will take on the next one.
But I think the President has, you know, made his case on this nomination. I think Judge Alito’s record—and if you look at the totality of his record, his service in the Justice Department, his service on the court, it is very clear that he will move the Court in a very different and dangerous direction for women’s legal rights. And—
Chairman SPECTER. I want to ask you one more question, and my time is almost up. You have commented about the other issues, philosophical—you have enumerated them, but we have been over

742
Executive and legislative power. We have been over congressional power, affirmative action, many items. Do you think that a nominee ought to be rejected on the basis of a single issue?
Ms. MICHELMAN. I don’t consider the right to privacy, personal privacy, the right to dignity and autonomy and control over one’s life as a single issue. I do think it is profound and will have enormously important implications for women, for men, for families in this Nation. And I do indeed think it is so serious and profound that he should be rejected on those grounds, even if there were no others, and I would subscribe there are other grounds.
Chairman SPECTER. Well, thank you very much for your testimony, Ms. Michelman—
Ms. MICHELMAN. You are welcome. Chairman Specter [continuing]. And for your service. You have been in the forefront of this issue for a long time, and I know how deeply you feel about it. And I thank you for sharing with us your personal experiences. They are not easy to testify about. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. I would concur with that. I thought of that prior to your testimony when reading the article about you yesterday in the Post, a story I was familiar with. And you are one of the reasons I came back. I was at a friend’s memorial service and will return to that right after my questioning. Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you. Senator LEAHY. But you are absolutely right that there is an awesome responsibility in the Senate in the choice, first with the 18 of us here, who are the only 18 people in America who got to question Judge Alito, if you don’t count the first vetting they had by Vice President Cheney, Karl Rove, and Scooter Libby a day or two before he was nominated by the President. As to that, of course, we are not privy to what was said or what assurances were made, nor was he about to share that with us. Mr. Gray, I am glad you are here. You spent a lifetime, a very distinguished lifetime, fighting for those denied the right to equal protection, equal dignity. I know that after you graduated law school, you immediately went to work defending two icons of America, Rosa Parks and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in the Montgomery bus boycott. We have heard Judge Alito say that one of the things that motivated him was his objection to Baker v. Carr, the reapportionment case. We heard Justice Frankfurter, who delivered a scathing dissent in that. And we know the position of the second Justice Harlan, who Judge Alito admires, who feels very strongly that Baker was wrong. How important was it that the Supreme Court didn’t follow these attitudes, didn’t follow Justice Harlan’s lead, and instead intervened in the 1960s to correct massive disparities in the size of voting districts, the underrepresentation of voters from urban areas, and to ensure the removal of poll taxes and other barriers to minorities to vote? What is the difference it makes in America today that the dissenters did not win? Mr. GRAY. The difference is then, prior to these decisions, and even prior to Brown v. Board of Education, and prior to Gomillion v. Lightfoot and Browder v. Gayle, the case that desegregated the

buses, we had very few African-Americans and other minorities registered. We had little or no African-Americans in public office. For example, in my state, in 1957 we had none. Now my State has approximately the same number of persons in our State legislature. It mirrors the population. We now have thousands of AfricanAmericans and other minorities who are holding public office, and an additional thousand that those public office holders have appointed to elected office.
Senator LEAHY. When you started this fight, did you very believe you would see an African-American mayor, an African-American sheriff in some of—
Mr. GRAY. No, sir. And the first one since Reconstruction was Lucius Amerson in my county. I got him elected, but I couldn’t get elected to the State legislature.
Senator LEAHY. That is why I raised that. You anticipated what I was raising.
Ms. Michelman, you know about the job application of Judge Alito to the Meese Justice Department. He said he personally believes very strongly the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion. In your reading of Judge Alito’s writings, but especially your observations of the past few days of these hearings, have you seen or heard anything to reassure you that Judge Alito’s personal beliefs about constitutional privacy will not affect his decisions as a judge?
Ms. MICHELMAN. No, I haven’t. In fact, I don’t think there is— again, if you go back to his memo you are referencing, the work he did in the Justice Department, and his record on the court, his decisions on the court I think reveal very clearly that he does not believe deeply in a fundamental right of privacy and apply that belief that the Constitution protects that fundamental right of privacy to individuals.
So, no, I am not—I am deeply concerned that Judge Alito not only was proud and discussed very openly how proud he was to be a part of an administration that repeatedly sought the Court to overrule Roe and overrule other privacy cases, but that he actually laid out a strategy for the administration to pursue the overruling of Roe in an incremental strategy, to pursue taking away the right of women to decide for themselves and to keep the government out of these very private decisions. He laid out a strategy that you could keep Roe in place as a shell, not overturn it directly, but incrementally dismantle those rights. And the States, by the way, have—the anti-choice movement in this country has pursued that strategy very effectively and there are now hundreds of laws that really burden women, both financially and emotionally, when they are trying to make responsible choices.
No, I have no confidence at all that Judge Alito, when faced with the question of whether women should decide or whether the government, State and Federal, has the right to interfere in these intimate decisions that women make, that he will come down on the side of the government.
Senator LEAHY. My time is up. Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you. Senator LEAHY. I just want to thank all five of you for being here. I know that it is not easy to come and very publicly oppose

somebody who has the backing of the President of the United States and the backing of so many powerful Senators to be on the U.S. Supreme Court. But it goes to the tradition of speaking truth to power, and I thank you all.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Senator Hatch? Senator HATCH. I think I will reserve my time, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Five minutes, a number of areas to cover. First, I thank all of you for being here. And, Dr. Gray, in the application, the 1985 application and where the nominee points out, ‘‘In college, I developed a deep interest in constitutional law, motivated in large part by disagreements with Warren Court decisions, particularly in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.’’ Just very, very quickly, how important—in terms of having our Nation, a fairer and more just Nation—how important are those Warren Court decisions on reapportionment? And just quickly, what would this country look like if they had not made those judgments? Would we be a different Nation? Mr. GRAY. We would be a different Nation, and it would all appear to be whites and no persons of color would have very little if any involvement in it. Senator KENNEDY. Professor Sullivan, I want to ask you about the impact of Judge Alito on average Americans. This is something we have heard from the power structures around here. I want to hear what impact you believe his service on the Court would have for average Americans, and I want to clarify that not all Fourth Amendment cases are criminal cases, there are civil cases too. Could you comment about that? Mr. SULLIVAN. Yes, that is correct. Senator KENNEDY. The idea that sometimes innocent people are caught up on these police searches and bring Fourth Amendment charges. Mr. SULLIVAN. Yes. In Groody, for example, which we have talked about a lot, it was a civil damages case. Congress has provided a remedy for our citizens when their rights have been violated, their constitutional rights, in this case search and seizure rights. Let me say that the Warren Court, in answer to your question, set forth a jurisprudence with respect to the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment, that in effect, limited the scope of police power vis-a-vis the average citizen, that there are some rights deeply enshrined in the Constitution that we all have from the highest and most powerful to the average Joe, and that is what the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment protect. My read of Judge Alito’s jurisprudence in this area is that he weakens the protections. He is very deferential to institutions and would allow law enforcement practices to expand in a way that I suggest to you would have a negative and detrimental impact on the nonpowerful in our country. Senator KENNEDY. Professor Flym, just on this issue of recusal, is it your understanding that under the existing code of conduct for

745
U.S. judges, that Judge Alito should have complied, should have recused himself, and should have established on his letter of recusal or on the system, Vanguard, and that he failed to do so with his interpretation of the ethic?
Mr. FLYM. Absolutely, Senator. But in addition to the Code of Judicial Conduct that is frequently understood in terms of ethical rules, the statute enacted by Congress in 1964 trumps whatever else may be adopted, and it is unmistakably clear that he had an obligation to recuse.
Senator KENNEDY. Ms. Michelman, I want to first of all thank you. That was a splendid performance on Meet the Press.
Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you. Senator KENNEDY. In response to the questions, just to pick up on the Chairman’s thought where you talked about the dignity of women. You touched on it here now. I would just like you to use up whatever time I have in talking about what you think the implications would be by this nominee, just on women’s issues just generally. I think you have spoken very, very eloquently on the choice issue. Obviously, refer to that if you would too, but I am very, very interested in this broad view of yours about both the dignity of women, women in the family, women in our society, the role that they are playing, and a bit about what kind of country we would be if we did not have justices that protected that, and what kind of country we can become if they do. Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you, Senator, also for your generous comment about my Meet the Press performance. We should not forget that women have had a long and hard journey to full equality in this Nation. It has only been 84 years since we have had the right to vote. So it has been a long and difficult journey, and one that has taken great effort, and both as a political movement, but also through the law, to have recognized that we could vote, we could own property, we could get charge accounts—which I was denied the right to have a charge account because I was not married in 1969. It was shocking. So it has been a very long and arduous journey. Women’s equality and full capacity to be partners, equal partners with men in the socioeconomic political life of this Nation is dependent on our right to determine the course of our lives, our right to education, our right to employment, our right to equal pay. All of these things are determined by our right to control our lives, and we absolutely need a legal system that recognizes, respects women’s dignity and autonomy, including our right to determine when to become mothers and under what circumstances, and even whether. It is hard to find the words to adequately express how important that is. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. My time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. Without objection, there will be placed in the record a large group of letters relevant to the issue, and I want to remind everybody on the Committee that under Committee practices, that as with the proceeding on Chief Justice Roberts, all questions must be submitted within 24 hours of the close of the hearing, which will be a little later today, perhaps even shortly. Senator Hatch?

Senator HATCH. Let me just greet all of you and thank you for being here. Dr. Gray, I have tremendous respect for you. You have led a lot of fights in this country under very, very trying circumstances. Having been born on the other side of the street myself, I understand a little bit about how tough that might be from time to time, but I am sure not nearly as much as you understand it.
Mr. GRAY. Thank you, Senator. Senator HATCH. Ms. Michelman, it is always nice to see you. Ms. MICHELMAN. Good to see you too. Senator HATCH. As you know, I have respect for other points of view as well. Mr. Sullivan, nice to get acquainted with you. Ms. Frost, with you. Mr. Flym, I have to say I disagree with you, as do almost every ethics expert I know, including the American Bar Association, but I appreciate your advocacy for your client. That is always appreciated by me, and respect you for it. I just wanted to greet all of you and let you know that we appreciate you coming. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Hatch. Senator Sessions? Senator SESSIONS. Mr. Gray, it is a delight to have you here. You are certainly one of Alabama’s most distinguished citizens. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Gray just completed tenure as President of the Alabama Bar Association and traveled the State extensively and talked on these subjects, and I think, reminded people a lot about just what our situation has been and how far we have come and things that we still need to do. So, Mr. Gray is an extraordinary leader, capable of holding any high office in this country, and it is a pleasure to get to know him. I have read with great interest his book, ‘‘Bus Ride to Justice.’’ He talks about that first bus boycott in the ’50s with Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, and the tension, and the work, and the enthusiasm, and the courage that was shown at that time. It is really remarkable, and it is important for us to remember it. We have a lot of things to do, but, Mr. Gray, I thank you for your service. Mr. GRAY. Thank you very much, Senator, and I even talk about the judgeship which was not to be in that book too. Senator SESSIONS. Well, we have both been there, have we not? [Laughter.] Mr. GRAY. Yes, sir. Senator SESSIONS. We may have a little more jaundiced eye than some around here about this process. Mr. GRAY. That is correct. Senator SESSIONS. When you came out of college, I notice in your book you mention several times you had a commitment in the ’50s, ‘‘destroying everything segregated I could find.’’ Mr. GRAY. That was the motivating factor, Senator, as to why I became a lawyer, and I wish this nominee had that kind of commitment. If so, I would not feel uncomfortable and would not be troubled.

Senator SESSIONS. But Gomillion v. Lightfoot was—I mean you had the Vivian Malone case at the University of Alabama, you were involved in that, the syphilis study at Tuskegee, the Gomillion v. Lightfoot, and of course, Rosa Parks case. But on Gomillion you made an argument that I think at first appeared not to be. I mean, Colegrove v. Green was a Supreme Court case that seemed to stand squarely in your way. In fact, you lost it in earlier rounds of the Court, but you had a vision that this gerrymander of that city was directly driven to deny people the right to vote, and that was your idea and your concept. Would you just share that?
Mr. GRAY. Yes, sir, that is exactly the thing, and I illustrated it by having a map drawn to scale of the old city limits and the new city limits, showing where the blacks were excluded, and go all the way in to include whites. And I think that case, no question, set the precedent for these other cases. If Reynolds v. Sims had been first, I do not think we would have won, but with Gomillion, which shows an extreme situation, but the purpose of the State in all of these cases was the same, and that was to avoid minorities from voting.
I am glad we have passed that, but we still have, even in Alabama, major cases. The higher education case, the Knight case is still pending. We still have cases—and Lee v. Macon that I filed in ’63, elementary school cases, where there are no degrees in, and now my sons are handling those cases, and we still have a teacher testing case in Alabama that is still pending. So we need to have a strong Supreme Court if we are going to continue to make progress.
Senator SESSIONS. I would point out a couple of things. First, it took a reversal of precedent to make this happen, so sometimes bad precedent ought not to be kept on the books. We have been talking about precedent and stare decisis an awful lot here, and I wanted to mention that.
I would just say, Mr. Gray, I think, as Judge Alito has explained it, his father was a nonpartisan clerk for the New Jersey legislature. They were trying to redistrict the legislature, and the court was ignoring classical, geographical or political boundaries, counties and that kind of thing, and that is where his frustration came, not with the concept, which he has affirmed clearly here, of one man/one vote.
Mr. GRAY. I want to thank you, Senator, and I want to publicly thank you for doing what you have done in helping the Tuskegee Human and Civil Rights Multicultural Center, which is designed to preserve some of this rich history in that part of the State, and I want to thank you for it.
Senator SESSIONS. And we can thank Chairman Specter for helping us some on that.
Mr. GRAY. Thank you very much. Senator SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. You were not going to conclude, Senator Sessions, without saying why you can thank Senator Specter. Senator SESSIONS. For helping us with the Tuskegee Human and Civil Rights Center. Thank you, sir. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. Senator Coburn.

Senator SESSIONS. You have always been accommodating. Senator COBURN. Senator, I will defer. There is obviously a very distinguished panel before us, each a leader in their own way, respected for their advocacy and their heart, and their desire to make our country better. The fact that you would come here today and put forward your views lends great credibility to the process, and places more responsibility on us to hear every point of view as we make a consideration on this nominee, and I thank you for coming. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Coburn. Thank you, Mr. Gray and Ms. Michelman, Professor Sullivan, Professor Frost, Professor Flym.

Let’s have order in the hearing room, please. Our first panelist on the sixth and final panel is Kate Pringle from the Litigation Department of Friedman, Kaplan, Seiler and Adelman, a graduate with honors from American University in 1990, cum laude from Georgetown University Law Center, editorin-chief of the Law Journal there. Ms. Pringle was one of Judge Alito’s clerks in the 1993–94 term. Thank you for joining us, Ms. Pringle, and the floor is yours for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF KATHERINE L. PRINGLE, PARTNER, FRIEDMAN KAPLAN SEILER & ADELMAN, LLP, NEW YORK, NEW YORK
Ms. PRINGLE. Mr. Chairman and honorable members of the Committee, thank you very much. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to share my experiences with and personal observations of Judge Alito, for whom I did clerk in 1993 to 1994 and who has served as my mentor since that time.
First, let me explain briefly the job of a law clerk. It is the law clerk’s job to provide legal research to the judge, to assist him in his analysis, and generally to act as a sounding board in the difficult process of deciding cases. As Judge Garth indicated yesterday, it is an unusually close professional relationship.
I began my clerkship for Judge Alito upon my graduate from Georgetown Law School. I was then—as I am now—a committed and active Democrat. I had heard from some of my professors that Judge Alito had a reputation as a conservative, and I, therefore, expected his to be an ideologically charged chambers, in which I would battle to defend my liberal ideals against his conservative ones.
But what I found was something very different than what I had expected. I learned in my year with Judge Alito that his approach to judging is not about personal ideology or ambition, but about hard work and devotion to law and justice.
I would like to share with you several things that I learned about Judge Alito during the time I which I worked with him.
First, I learned that Judge Alito reaches his decisions by working through cases from the bottom up, not the top down, to use a

phrase that we heard from Judge Roberts. Judge Alito taught me to try to ignore my personal predispositions and to come to each case with an open mind. He taught me to work carefully through an analysis of the facts of the case and the legal precedents, and to try to find the resolution that flowed from that analysis.
Judge Alito consistently applied this bottom-up approach. He approached every case without a personal agenda and with a commitment to careful and methodical review. His approach was demanding. He read and reread the record of each case, the decisions cited, and the relevant decisions that the parties had failed to cite. I remember him building a model from string and paper to try to figure out the events of one case, and I remember him physically acting out the events of another, all in an attempt to truly understand the facts. He worked hard on every case, large or small, and he sought to find the result that flowed from the facts and the law, divorced from any personal bias or interest.
Second, I learned that Judge Alito is interested in, and respectful of, differing points of view. The law clerks with whom I worked spanned the ideological spectrum. I later learned that this is typical and that Judge Alito selects law clerks with widely varying backgrounds political outlooks, and personal views. This led to lively debates amongst the law clerks. In my experience, Judge Alito was never dismissive of any point of view. He encouraged our input, challenged each of us to substantiate our views, and listened carefully to the points that each of us made.
Judge Alito treated advocates before him with that same respect. He asked probing questions, which he refused to let the advocates sidestep. But he was never caustic or rude, and he always appreciated the honest efforts of an advocate.
Judge Alito was similarly respectful of the differing opinions of his fellow judges on the Third Circuit. He sought to forge consensus where consensus could be reached. When he dissented from another judge’s views, he did so in a respectful and intellectually honest way. The appreciation that all of Judge Alito’s colleagues on the bench have for him is reflected in the outpouring of support at these hearings from other judges on the Third Circuit.
Finally, I learned that Judge Alito approaches his job with personal humility and a great respect for the institution of the courts. What I saw was a person cognizant of the limited role assigned to him by the Constitution to interpret the law as established by written law and prior precedent. Judge Alito did not, in my experience, ever treat a case as a platform for a personal agenda or ambition. Rather, his decisions are limited to the issue at hand. They demonstrate an effort to interpret honestly and faithfully apply the law to the parties that seek justice before him.
Apart from his judicial approach, Judge Alito was a thoughtful and generous boss. He took the time to get to know his clerks and to learn about us and our families. He had none of the personal arrogance that sometimes attends power.
It was my great privilege to work with and learn from Judge Alito at the outset of my career. Many of Judge Alito’s law clerks, both men and women, both Republicans and Democrats, have traveled to Washington to be here for these hearings. We are all here because we feel strongly about Judge Alito’s talent and character.

We all believe that he will be an outstanding Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. Pringle appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Ms. Pringle. Our next witness is Congressman Charles Gonzalez. Representative Gonzalez was first elected to the House in 1998. He is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He served as a Texas Regional Whip for the Democratic Caucus and as Chair of the Hispanic Caucus Civil Rights Task Force. Congressman Gonzalez has been Chair of the House Judiciary Initiative for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. There is a little extra time left over from the time given to the judges yesterday, so we are going to start the clock at 8 minutes for each of the witnesses invited by the Democrats, and you have 8 minutes, Representative Gonzalez.
STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES A. GONZALEZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS
Representative GONZALEZ. Well, thank you very much, Chairman Specter, and, of course, Senator Kennedy. And today I am representing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in my capacity as the Chairman of the Hispanic Judiciary Initiative and Task Force on Civil Rights.
The Hispanic Caucus was obviously disappointed that the President did not nominate a highly qualified Hispanic to the bench. We did not expect a Hispanic to be nominated for the sake of being a Hispanic. We did expect the administration to have recognized the need for our Nation’s highest Court to reflect the Nation’s diversity in all its forms—thought, experience, and expression.
The Hispanic Caucus’s policy with respect to the evaluation of nominees for judicial vacancies requires an extensive examination of each nominee in order to assess the following: his or her commitment to equal justice and right of access to the courts, his or her efforts in support for Congress’s constitutional authority to pass civil rights legislation, and his or her efforts in support of protecting employment, immigrant, and voting rights, as well as educational and political access for all Americans.
Our process is also assisted by the excellent work of many legal and advocacy organizations, and I would like to especially thank the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund for their efforts to assist us in our work.
Allow me to highlight a few areas that cause the Hispanic Caucus great concern:
Discrimination in jury selection, Pemberthy v. Beyer. Judge Alito’s ruling would allow the use of language to serve as a pretext to discriminate on the basis of ethnicity.
Voting Rights Act violation, Jenkins v. Manning. Judge Alito appears to have joined the majority opinion in that case. It dealt with at-large school district voting systems. Judge Alito, along with the majority—and we are assuming that that is what he signed off on—found no violation of the Voting Rights Act even though his-

torically only 3 out of 10 black candidates over a 10-year period were elected.
Constitutional rights of noncitizens. His 1986 memo to FBI Director William Webster, in which Judge Alito appears to ignore precedent, cited old law to accommodate denying constitutional protections to immigrants.
Commerce Clause application. You all have discussed the United States v. Rybar case. Judge Alito’s reasoning would seriously hamper Congress from passing laws to address civil rights abuses.
Equal employment opportunity, Bray v. Marriott Hotels, which you have also touched on. Judge Alito would impose a standard that deviates from accepted legal norms, making it extremely difficult to prove discrimination based on race or gender.
The Hispanic Caucus wishes to acknowledge the indispensable role the U.S. Senate plays in determining the composition of the Supreme Court. We know that the nominee will be someone of President Bush’s choosing. However, this does not necessarily mean that the Supreme Court should be a mere extension of the executive branch. The Nation’s Founding Fathers did not intend it to be and, therefore, subjected the President’s nominees to Senate approval by way of advice and consent.
There may be a good-faith disagreement as to the appropriate parameters limiting the types of questions asked of the nominee by this Committee, but no one would argue that questions establishing a nominee’s judicial philosophy are universally contemplated under advice and consent. The Hispanic Caucus is aware that political, social, and economic forces in any society play to the advantage of the employer over the employee, the able-bodied over the disabled, the citizen over the immigrant, the majority over the minority, the wealthy over the poor, and the state over the individual. But in this country, it has been the third branch of Government, the judicial branch, which has countered the tendency to abuse this innate ‘‘advantage’’ by acting as the great equalizer regardless of one’s status.
For the Hispanic Caucus, the desired judicial philosophy is a simple one and is best expressed in the following quotation: ‘‘There is so much to be done that demands the full capacities of our hearts and souls, but, truly, where shall we begin? Perhaps I will begin with you? Keep in mind...that if your life is without value, so is mine. If the law does not protect you, it will not, in the end, protect me.’’
The Hispanic Caucus does not believe that Judge Alito’s writings and decisions embrace this simple but profound judicial sentiment. We do not argue that he possesses a brilliant legal mind and has had an accomplished career. And I will state that we do not believe that he is a racist or a bigot. But this is not the controlling issue. The issue is what judicial philosophy guides and motivates such a gifted and talented person in his decisionmaking process. In the end this should not be a question of party affiliation or conservative versus liberal beliefs. Any Republican, any Democrat, any conservative, or any liberal should share a judicial compass that points them to the inevitable truth that indeed ‘‘if the law does not protect you’’ then it protects no one.

I will be recommending to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that it oppose this nomination. Thank you very much.
[The prepared statement of Representative Gonzalez appears as a submission for the record.]
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Representative Gonzalez. We now turn to another Member of the House of Representatives. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz serves the 20th Congressional District of Florida. Her resume notes—and since it is on her resume, I will read it—she is the first Jewish Congresswoman ever elected from Florida to the House. She serves on the Financial Services Committee and the Committee on the Judiciary. Thank you for joining us, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, and you have 8 minutes.
STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA
Representative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Senators. I am honored to speak to you as you consider the nomination of an individual to a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. And I come before you today in several capacities.
First, I am here as a Member of Congress, proudly representing the people of South Florida.
Second, I am here as a member of a generation that benefited from long-fought Supreme Court battles, resulting in equal rights for all Americans, which is a fundamental principle of our democracy.
Third, I am here in my most rewarding role: as the mother of three young children who will come of age in an America guided by many of the decisions that this Court will make.
I cannot imagine my children’s future in an America without privacy rights and the civil rights and liberties that all Americans enjoy today.
These are the reasons that I am here today, to express the concerns about the rights and freedoms that, based on his record, I believe would be threatened by Judge Alito’s elevation to the Supreme Court. And, therefore, I urge you to reject his nomination.
By now we are all very familiar with Judge Alito’s writings and views on reproductive rights, each one indicating a different nuance of his opinion on a woman’s right to choose. But really here is the bottom line: You are considering a nominee who wrote a memo urging the courts to restrict a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices. Judge Alito ruled, actually ruled in support of spousal notification. In essence, he is comfortable putting a woman’s constitutional right to make decisions about her body in the hands of her spouse as soon as she signs her marriage license.
This blatant disregard for individual rights is why our Founding Fathers designed a meaningful system of checks and balances. And once any branch of Government surrenders itself to the others, that authority is difficult to regain.
Now, I come from a State where Executive power and Government intrusion on privacy rights has been repeatedly abused. Florida’s Governor pushed the State legislature to grant him authority

to overturn a judicial decision in the Terry Schiavo case, and Congress inserted itself into that family’s private tragedy.
Ultimately, the case could have reached the Supreme Court. Now, let’s think about this for a minute. Can America risk Justice Alito, a Supreme Court Justice Alito, casting the deciding vote to drag us through another tragic saga similar to the Terry Schiavo case? I don’t think America can endure another Terry Schiavo case.
In another disturbing privacy matter, Judge Alito’s lack of judgment, I believe, was appalling. In this case, a police officer stripsearched a 10-year-old girl and her mother. They were not named in the search warrant; they were simply on the premises.
According to the Boston Globe, the 10-year-old girl’s lawyer later reported Judge Alito as saying, ‘‘Why do you keep bringing up the fact that this case involves the strip-search of a 10-year-old child?’’
Why? Because this was not a simple case of whether or not the officers exceeded their investigative authority. It escalated to an unconscionable level.
Judge Alito was the only member of a three-judge panel who found the strip-search of the 10-year-old acceptable under his interpretation of the law.
Now, I am horrified that someone could strip-search my children because of selective interpretation of a warrant.
And as you consider this nomination, I ask you to reflect: Would you be comfortable if your own child was the subject of a stripsearch? Based on his record, would you be comfortable if your little girl was the plaintiff with Judge Alito as the deciding vote?
The standard must be higher when cases involve the most vulnerable members of our society—our children. When enforcement authorities lapse, our courts must not.
Now, despite his questionable affiliations with discriminatory organizations such as the Concerned Alumni of Princeton, there is no question, as has been acknowledged by many others, that Judge Alito had impressive education credentials and he had led a distinguished career. But credentials alone do not qualify an individual for elevation to the Supreme Court.
Senators, as you contemplate the profound influence Justice O’Connor’s successor will have on the lives, liberties, and legal protections of Americans for decades to come, I ask you to consider that Judge Alito is a nominee who will replace one of only two women Justices. This really reflects a missed opportunity to retain or even expand, as my colleague referred to, the existing diversity of the Court.
Now, I distinctly remember the feeling that I had in 1981, Mr. Chairman, when I was 14 years old and I first heard that a woman would serve on the Supreme Court. It proved to me what my parents had told me my whole life: that in America, little girls really can grow up and be anything that they want to be. That is an amazing thing about this country, and it is one that we really need to carefully think about, especially with the selection and elevation of a Supreme Court nominee. The message that we send to little girls in America really needs to be a strong one when it comes to nominations like this one.
The Supreme Court, Senators, is the final arbiter in our Nation, and today you stand as the guardians to its membership. From

Marbury v. Madison to Brown v. Board of Education, the fingerprints of the U.S. Senate have subtly steered the highest Court in this Nation time and again. And long after we have completed our public service here, the decisions made by the Supreme Court will continue to impact all Americans, and history will really judge your decision.
And I just want to close by just asking you to think about the role of the legislative branch. I have served as a legislator in the State legislature or in the Congress for the last 13 years, and I think we should zealously guard our legislative authority. We are, after all, the only directly elected branch of Government. And I think we need to carefully think about how this nominee thinks about our role in the governmental process. I think many of his views have demonstrated that given his belief in a unitary Executive or, at the very least, the strength of the Executive, we should carefully think about how we believe our role as legislators would be compromised if he was elevated to the Supreme Court.
Thank you very much for this opportunity. [The prepared statement of Representative Wasserman Schultz appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. Our next witness is Mr. Jack White, associate in the San Francisco law firm of Kirkland and Ellis, graduated magna cum laude from Pepperdine Law School, editor in chief of the Law Review there; bachelor’s degree from the United States Military Academy at West Point, served as an active duty officer in the Army, and continues to serve as a captain in the Reserve. He is, according to his resume, a dedicated member of the ACLU and NAACP. He was one of Judge Alito’s law clerks in the 2003–04 term. Thank you for coming from San Francisco, Mr. White, and the floor is yours, but only for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF JACK WHITE, ASSOCIATE, KIRKLAND AND ELLIS, LLP, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
Mr. WHITE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy. I appreciate the opportunity to testify here today.
In order to provide some context for my comments, I would like to share some personal information about myself. I am the son of African-American parents born in the segregated South. Their respect for the recognition of civil liberties that enabled them to succeed and raise principled children inculcated the same respect in me. This respect is what led me to become a member of the NAACP and the ACLU. The same respect for our freedoms as Americans encouraged me to serve our country after graduating from West Point on active duty in the United States Army.
Now, as I clerked for Judge Alito, I saw a deep sense of duty, diligence, humanity, and respect for his role as a Federal appellate judge. Judge Alito required searching analysis of the factual and procedural background of every case. He required thorough evaluation of the applicable law in every case. He uniformly applied the relevant law to the specific facts of every case. Judge Alito recognized that every case was the most important case to the parties and attorneys with something at stake. There was no wavering

from this consistent, predictable method of his judicial decisionmaking process. Working for Judge Alito, I saw in him an abiding loyalty to a fair judicial process as opposed to an enslaved inclination toward a political or personal ideology.
What I found most intriguing and particularly exceptional about Judge Alito’s judicial decisionmaking process was the conspicuous absence of personal predilections. I never witnessed an occasion when personal or ideological beliefs motivated a specific outcome in a case. Indeed, after a year of working closely with the judge on cases concerning a wide variety of legal issues, I left New Jersey without knowing Judge Alito’s personal beliefs on any of them. Now, the reason I didn’t know his personal beliefs on all of these issues was that the jurist’s ideology was never an issue in a case that Judge Alito heard. Indeed, it is never an issue in any case. My fellow former law clerks have uniformly agreed, and we have communicated this notion to the Committee in a letter that we have provided.
Although Judge Alito’s sense of duty, diligence, and commitment to the decisionmaking process have inspired the collective support of his former law clerks, there is an additional characteristic that also heavily impressed me. On a daily basis, Judge Alito dealt with a wide variety of individuals, including law clerks, fellow judges, experienced attorneys, inexperienced attorneys, court staff, law students, and individuals throughout the community. Without fail, I saw Judge Alito treat everyone, every individual, with dignity and respect. In fact, on one occasion, my parents went to New Jersey to visit their son. Judge Alito suggested that I bring them to his chambers. Now, because oral arguments were rapidly approaching, I thought that the judge would shake their hand and we would quickly be on our way. Over an hour later, my parents left his office understanding my extreme regard for this jurist. At the end of the day, my parents left believing that meeting them was the highlight of Judge Alito’s day. Perhaps it was.
Working for Judge Alito provided me with the opportunity to witness American justice at work. I saw a jurist with an abiding respect for the strength, purpose, and authority of our Constitution, and a particular regard for the limited role of the judiciary envisioned by the Framers of our Constitution. From my experience, I will feel confident with Judge Alito serving as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, interpreting las that affect me.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. White appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. White. We turn now to Mr. Reginald Turner, president of the National Bar Association, partner in the Detroit law firm of Clark, Hill, practiced labor law and employment law and governmental relations for over 15 years, served as president of the Michigan State Bar Association, was a White House fellow, a graduate of Wayne University, where he got his bachelor’s degree, and a law degree from the University of Michigan Law School. We welcome you, Mr. Turner, and you have 8 minutes to testify.

STATEMENT OF REGINALD M. TURNER, JR., PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION, WASHINGTON, D.C.
Mr. TURNER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Senators. It is an extraordinary honor for me to be here today to testify on behalf of the National Bar Association.
Our association was founded in 1925 at a difficult time in our Nation’s history when lawyers of color could not belong to the American Bar Association or many of the State bars and other voluntary bar associations around the country. Today, we represent a network of over 20,000 lawyers with 80 affiliates around the world.
The National Bar has established a rigorous process for evaluating judicial nominees. We take a position on a nomination only after an exhaustive evaluation of the nominee’s record.
Judge Alito was evaluated consistent with this process. The results of our review are troubling to us, and we cannot support this nomination. We don’t take this position lightly. With President Bush’s nominations that exceed 200 in number, we have only taken positions either without support for or in opposition to three of President Bush’s nominees.
We understand that Judge Alito has solid educational and professional credentials, but these credentials alone are not sufficient, in our view, for a lawyer or judge to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. We strongly believe that a nominee to our Nation’s highest Court must share an unequivocal commitment to the basic rights and liberties afforded to all Americans under the United States Constitution.
In this country, race and the treatment of racial issues by the judiciary profoundly affect every aspect of American life and play critical roles in the formulation of social, economic, and political agendas. Accordingly, the National Bar Association has adopted a standard to determine whether a Federal judicial nominee will interpret the Constitution and laws to advance our great Nation’s slow but steady progress toward equality of opportunity.
Unfortunately, our legal system is not as colorblind as it aspires to be. In Grutter v. Bollinger, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor acknowledged that. She said, and I quote, ‘‘...in a society, like our own...race unfortunately still matters.’’ Thus, judicial nominees should be able to articulate support for constitutional principles, statutes, and legal doctrines that serve to extend the blessings of liberty to all Americans.
In sharp contrast to Justice O’Connor’s philosophy, Judge Alito’s work as a lawyer and as a judge reveal a hostility to these basic civil rights and civil liberties that makes his nomination particularly troublesome to the National Bar Association. His philosophy as a lawyer is revealed in his 1985 application for the position of Deputy Assistant Attorney General. Among other things in that application, then-Attorney Alito expressed disagreement with well-established Supreme Court precedents that relate to fundamental rights. Attorney Alito indicated at the time that he was attracted to constitutional law because of his ‘‘disagreement with Warren Court decisions,’’ including a series of landmark decisions that established the constitutional principle of one person/one vote. Under this fundamental doctrine, every citizen of the United States has

757
the right to an equally effective vote, rather than the mere right to cast a ballot.
We heard Fred Gray testify a few moments ago very eloquently about the impact of the Warren Court decisions that upheld the provision of one person/one vote. We heard of the tremendous impact on the inclusion in our Nation’s cadre of elected officials of people of color for the very first time in many States in the Southern part of this United States and in States around the country. We have heard of the tremendous progress made as a result of those decisions, progress which would not exist today if Judge Alito’s views on this issue had carried the day.
In addition, Judge Alito expressed opposition to programs designed to increase diversity in education and employment. He mischaracterized these programs as ‘‘quota systems’’ when, in fact, many of these programs were benign efforts on the part of educational institutions and employers to promote opportunities for those who traditionally had been disenfranchised from the mainstream of American society.
At the same time, then-attorney Alito proudly listed his membership in Concerned Alumni of Princeton, a group that advocated quotas for children of alumni of Princeton in an effort to reduce the admissions of women and minorities to that prestigious university.
Although these writings are 20 years old, they are relevant today because the views espoused by attorney Alito are reflected in the judicial record of Judge Alito. His judicial opinions evidence an agenda to reverse hard-fought civil rights gains and to limit improperly the authority and power of Congress, particularly in the area of providing remedies to unlawful discrimination and protecting the health, welfare, and safety of the American people.
Just to summarize some of these points, Judge Alito has been the most frequent dissenter among the Third Circuit Court of Appeals judges since his appointment in 1990. According to estimates by University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein, more than 90 percent of Judge Alito’s dissents take positions more conservative than those of his colleagues. He rejected the views of a majority of his court, as well as the rulings of six other Federal appellate courts, when he reasoned that the Federal law limiting the possession and transfer of machine guns was unconstitutional.
In civil rights cases where the Third Circuit was divided, Judge Alito opposed civil rights protections more than any of his colleagues. Indeed, he has advocated positions detrimental to civil rights 85 percent of the time and has filed solo dissents in more than a third of these cases.
In one civil rights case, Sheridan v. Dupont, all 10 of Judge Alito’s colleagues—appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike—agreed that a sex discrimination victim’s case was properly submitted to the jury, contrary to Judge Alito’s sole dissent.
In Doe v. Groody, Judge Alito’s dissent condoned the strip-search of a 10-year-old girl and her mother, even though they were not named in the warrant that authorized the search. The majority opinion by then-Judge Michael Chertoff criticized Judge Alito’s view as threatening to turn the search warrant requirement into ‘‘little more than the cliche ‘rubber stamp.’ ’’

758
In his dissent in Bray v. Marriott, Judge Alito argued for imposing an evidentiary burden on victims of discrimination that, according to the majority, would have eviscerated legal protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. In particular, the majority contended that Judge Alito’s position would protect employers from liability even in situations where employment discrimination was the result of conscious racial bias.
In conclusion, on the basis of our thorough review of Judge Alito’s record, the National Bar Association cannot support the nomination of Judge Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. For several decades, Judge Alito has championed limitations on civil rights and voting, resulting in curtailed educational and employment opportunities for people of color and women. If his views had prevailed in many cases, our Nation would not be far beyond the regrettable days when opportunities for Americans, like retiring Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and the late Justice Thurgood Marshall, were truncated on the basis of gender and race. Now is not the time for retrenchment. Now is the time for America to step forward into the 21st century and open the doors of mainstream society for the benefit and protection of all Americans.
Again, thank you very much for the opportunity to testify. [The prepared statement of Mr. Turner appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Turner.

ordinary posture is to take no position on nominees to the Federal courts. So I am not here with any pleasure.
I am not here to challenge Judge Alito’s intellect or his integrity. I am not here to engage in the politics of personal demonization, which takes all of us on a low road that leads us to a place where I think we are all diminished.
Many fine people have testified on both sides of this nomination, people whom I know and respect and admire, and I think it is very important to understand that people of good will may differ on this nomination and the substantive issues that lead them to take positions on this nomination.
I, with all due respect, hasten to add that there is nothing remarkable about colleagues on the Federal bench and former law clerks taking positions in support of this nominee. Collegiality is a very, very important commodity on the bench, and, of course, I think it is quite a heady thing to know someone who is being nominated to the Supreme Court. I don’t suggest that that is why they support him. I am saying that they know him personally. But this is not about personality and it is not personal.
We are compelled to testify in opposition to the nomination of Judge Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court based on a standard that the judge himself articulated. I think it is the correct standard. He said, ‘‘If you want to know what kind of Justice I would be on the Supreme Court, look at my record on the court of appeals.’’
That is exactly what we have done, and it is only on that basis that we have arrived at the position that we have taken.
I want to encourage all of the members of the Judiciary Committee to read our report in full. Our review of his record has convinced us that his confirmation to the Supreme Court would cause a substantial shift in the Court’s civil rights jurisprudence in a manner that would make it significantly more difficult for civil rights plaintiffs to prevail.
In his 15 years on the bench, Judge Alito has a record in civil rights that is extremely troubling to us. For example, in all that time he has voted for employment discrimination plaintiffs who are African-Americans on the merits of their cases twice. Some might say that that is a reflection of the strength of the cases that are coming before the court these days. We believe it is not, and without going into the detail that other people have gone into already— it would be redundant—I point to, for example, the Bray case—and I think it is very instructive—where Judge Alito took a position that appeared to us, at least, to be gratuitous.
The issue there was whether the jury would get an employment discrimination, whether it would go to the jury. And the reason proffered by the employer for the adverse employment decision claimed to be discriminatory, was proven and shown, demonstrated to be pretextual under the law as the majority saw it, and I think logic supports it. An inference can be drawn by a jury that the motivations were in fact discriminatory once the pretext has been exposed.
Judge Alito, it seemed to us, worked hard to arrive at a conclusion that that case should not even go to the jury, and it demonstrates a cramped and narrow reading of Title VII and civil

rights laws, which we believe is symptomatic of his views on civil rights issues in general.
I want to be very clear, because one of the members of this Committee raised the issue of whether anyone was alleging that Judge Alito harbors a bias. I want to be very clear on behalf of the Legal Defense Fund, that we are not saying that he harbors racial bias or that he is a racist. That would, as I indicated before, diminish all of us. Whatever his reason for ruling the way he does in cases, the record is consistently clear, as my colleague and friend, Reginald Turner, has indicated, and as our report has indicated. It is very difficult for African-American plaintiffs in civil rights cases to prevail.
Now, it is not limited to African-American plaintiffs, but those are the individuals whom we represent at the Legal Defense Fund. Certainly, his view of interpretation of civil rights laws extends to gender discrimination, some of the cases which we have highlighted in our report, and it extends to other areas with respect to individual rights.
Now, we believe that his views with respect to reinforcement, which have been here, are deeply troubling. We believe in the area of criminal justice his views are troubling, but I particularly want to point to an area about which we have a deep concern. The analogy with baseball has been very popular—and I want to end on this point—before this Committee and in these nominations. And Judge Alito, at one time, used to like to say about affirmative action that Henry Aaron would not be regarded as the all-time home run king and hero that he is if the fences had been moved in whenever he came to bat. I think that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about affirmative action. The issue, with respect to civil rights and affirmative action advocates is not about asking that the fences be moved in, it is about asking about an opportunity to take the field, to stand at the plate, it is about an opportunity to play the game. And that is, I think, a fundamental difference in how one views the world with respect to issues of race these days.
I would like to conclude by saying that no one more than those of us at the Legal Defense Fund in this Nation would be happier if in fact our views are misplaced. And I am told, or we are told, we read that he will certainly be confirmed. We think that is before the Senate Judiciary Committee. But no one would be happier if our views are misplaced. We hope that that is right if he is confirmed. But we cannot take a position based upon hope. We have taken a position based upon his record, and we reluctantly and regretfully conclude that we must oppose Judge Alito’s nomination to the United States Supreme Court.
Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Shaw appears as a submission for the record.] Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Shaw. And now my 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. White, when you served as Judge Alito’s law clerk—and you have identified in your brochure your membership in the NAACP and ACLU—what was your sense of his view of equality of African-Americans, equality of opportunity?

Mr. WHITE. When I served I worked with him on several cases where race issues arose among blacks and whites and other types of race issues. Mr. Shaw, for whom I have the utmost respect, says that it is not about personality, it is not about the person, and I respectfully disagree. Judge Alito, when he was testifying, he said he has an open mind. During my testimony I said that Judge Alito treats everyone the same, and I also mentioned that he looks at every case as a brand new case. My experience was that he did look with an open mind, and that it is not personal. I have to respectfully disagree with that as well. It is kind of personal.
On the street that I live I am the only African-American, and I can walk down the street without being racially profiled. Judge Alito has ruled that racial profiling is incorrect. So that is very personal to me. In my experience, he was very fair and open-minded.
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. White. I want to move to Mr. Turner at this point. Judge Tim Lewis testified yesterday, had been on the Third Circuit with Judge Alito for several years, an African-American. Identified himself as being very strongly pro-choice and very active in civil rights issues, and said that he would never consider supporting Judge Alito if there was any doubt in his mind as to Judge Alito’s dedication to civil liberties. Do the views of Judge Lewis, Mr. White, who worked with him closely, have any impact on your thinking? Mr. TURNER. Well, I would agree with my colleague and dear friend, Ted Shaw, that the folks who have worked with a lawyer or judge very closely in the course of their careers will have developed friendship and camaraderie with that person in ways that would promote good feelings about that person’s character, temperament and ability. Chairman SPECTER. You think a little bias for Judge Alito? Mr. TURNER. I would not use the word bias. That is a very positive— Chairman SPECTER. Wait a minute. That is why I used it. Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman— Chairman SPECTER. Wait a minute. You do not have to use it. [Laughter.] Mr. TURNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our view of Judge Alito is based upon his record as a lawyer and as a judge. It is based on his writings during the time that he was a lawyer in the Justice Department, and on the basis of his rulings from the bench, which have presented an ultra-conservative tendency to rule against people of color and women in cases involving discrimination, and to rule in favor of employers and other institutions that have sought to— Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Turner. I have to move on to Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz. Mr. TURNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman SPECTER. You know the political process, the election of Presidents and campaign issues, and I am sure your deep interest in this issue has led you to see the other reported prospects for the Supreme Court should Judge Alito be rejected, and you have heard Judge Alito’s statements about what he would consider on stare decisis. Do you think if Judge Alito is rejected you will get somebody you like better?

Representative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I am hopeful—I recognize that the President, obviously, has the right to nominate a conservative. And I am a Democrat, and I recognize that given that the President is a Republican that that is likely what he would do with almost any nominee.
But Americans have the right to expect that he will not nominate an extremist, and I agree with Mr. Shaw and Mr. Turner, it is well expected that colleagues of his—I served in the State Senate. I understand what collegiality is. Colleagues of his, former law clerks, they are going to express—
Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz.
One last question, Ms. Pringle and also Mr. White. Ms. Pringle, two parts. What do you think about as concerns about women’s issues? And both Mr. White and Ms. Pringle, there has been concern that Judge Alito may favor the powerful in the Government. You both clerked for him, saw him on specific cases. I would like your evaluation on that. Ms. Pringle?
Ms. PRINGLE. I found that the Judge approached each case without a predisposition toward one party or the other. He does have respect for law enforcement, but I also felt that he had respect for the individual plaintiffs or the individual parties who came before him, and treated them in a fair and open-minded way.
And I also think that—I understand the comments that have been made about personal relationships bearing on a witness’s testimony, but I do think that a 15-year record gives an opportunity for every group to find something that they like or dislike.
What I wish is that everyone on the Committee had had the opportunity that I have had to really get to know this person, because I believe that the concerns about his character and his approach to judging would be alleviated by that opportunity to really know and work with this person.
Chairman SPECTER. Mr. White? Mr. WHITE. Judge Alito’s testimony and his record show that he has ruled in favor of the Government, and he has ruled in favor of what has been called the little guy, and from my experience, he always ruled fairly after thorough evaluation of the facts and application of relevant law. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. As I just came, I was going to let Senator Kennedy go. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was interested in Mr. Shaw and Mr. Turner’s reactions to the significance of Judge Alito’s opinion in that Riley v. Taylor case, where he analogized statistics on left-handed Presidents and right-handed Presidents to statistical evidence of discrimination in jury selection. You are familiar with this case where they struck three blacks from the jury and a black defendant was sentenced to death. Judge Alito found no cause to reject that, and used this right-hand, left-hand analogy. Are you familiar with that case? And maybe you would comment on that briefly. Has that got a ring to you, and does it within the community? It was such a startling fact situation, certainly for me. I am just wondering your own response, reaction.

Mr. SHAW. Senator Kennedy, the Legal Defense Fund has litigated issues involving discrimination in jury selection almost throughout its existence. In fact, the late Judge Constance Baker Motley, when she was a Legal Defense Fund lawyer, argued Swain v. Alabama in the Supreme Court, which set a standard that existed for many years, which was inadequate to protect against discrimination in jury selection. The Legal Defense Fund litigated Batson v. Kentucky, which changed that standard.
We believe that Judge Alito’s comparison of race discrimination with people who are left- or right-handed really trivializes the significance of race discrimination and the history of race discrimination, and a continuing problem with respect to jury selection.
And within the Third Circuit, Philadelphia itself and the District Attorney’s Office recently, has had some terrible problems that have been exposed with respect to intentional discrimination with respect to jury selection.
Senator KENNEDY. I will ask Mr. Turner, but just this last comment to Dr. Gray’s comment about the continuing ongoing challenge that we are facing, I think there are many of us in the Congress who just think, ‘‘Well, the next thing up is the Voting Rights Act,’’ but that is really the only thing that is out there. I think what has been mentioned by Mr. Shaw and also Mr. Turner and Dr. Gray, is that this is an ongoing, continuing everyday battle in almost every part of the country, including my part of the country.
Mr. TURNER. Yes. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. I agree with you wholeheartedly, and in fact, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, as I quoted in my remarks, understands that, unfortunately, in this Nation race still matters. Our justice system is not as blind as it aspires to be, as we would all like for it to be, and it is particularly reprehensible for attorneys to use racial bias in the selection of jurors. Jurors are central, critical to our American system of justice. It is through the jury as fact-finder that we commonly seek to find truth in our justice system, and where that process is subverted on the basis of racial discrimination, particularly in a death penalty case, we strike at the very heart of what I know we all believe to be fundamental principles of justice in our society, and we believe Judge Alito’s position and his remarks certainly minimize those important principles, if not completely disregard them.
Senator KENNEDY. Just in the brief time left, just one question, and that is how the Supreme Court looks to all of you. You represent different traditions, women, Hispanics, blacks. We want the Supreme Court to be universally respected and their decisions respected, and I think most of us believe that to the extent that it can reflect what our society has become in its diversity, and with all of its dynamism and its creativity, and evolving opportunity. I am just wondering whether any of you have a reaction. I think the Congressman has mentioned—I know we are short in time, but if each of you could just take just half a minute or so to tell us what you think in terms of this nominee versus what we are really hopeful of achieving in terms of a Supreme Court that is going to be reflective of our country and our society. Are you concerned about it? Should it make a difference? Does it make a difference? What do you think? Just go down the line. I know my time is up. This will be my last question, obviously.

Ms. PRINGLE. I personally would like to see more women justices on the Supreme Court, and I hope that is something that we will aspire to as a country, but I am also pleased to see an ItalianAmerican, first generation, lawyer on the Supreme Court as well.
Representative GONZALEZ. And as a Hispanic, of course, it would be important to have a Hispanic on the Supreme Court of Texas, but Senator, at the end of the day, in final analysis, the truth is, give us anybody up there who will give us a fair shake and is not predisposed, and when we have a President who says, ‘‘I am going to be nominating individuals more in the mode of Scalia and Thomas,’’ he gives us great cause to pause and ponder and question.
Representative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. This nomination is particularly important because of who Judge Alito would be replacing. He is replacing the first woman to ever serve on the Supreme Court, and he is replacing someone who has consistently been the key swing vote in very significant cases that matter to women and minorities in this country, and he has very divergent views from Justice O’Connor, and I think that is incredibly important to know.
Senator KENNEDY. Mr. White? Mr. WHITE. I think it is extremely important to have a Supreme Court that reflects the people for whom it is interpreting the laws. In the absence of an African-American nominee, I think that Judge Alito was an excellent choice. Mr. TURNER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. I believe diversity may be America’s greatest asset, and when we fail to embrace our Nation’s diversity, particularly in an area as important as judicial appointments, we polarize our Nation at a time when unity and tolerance of diversity is critically important to our continued advancement as a great Nation, critical to our national security and our productivity. Mr. SHAW. Senator Kennedy, I think we are long past the time when a Latino, a Hispanic ought to be on the Supreme Court. I believe diversity on the Supreme Court is important, but I am more concerned about the substance of the Supreme Court. The Court has been divided in race cases for the last 25 years with a narrow 5–4 edge in most cases. Justice O’Connor was the deciding vote in many of those cases. We did not always get her vote, but it was in play. That is what we are concerned about with respect to this nomination. Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank all of our panel. Chairman SPECTER. Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, most of the questions have been asked, so I am not going to ask them again. I have read carefully the statements of each one of you, and I appreciate you being here, and I apologize, as I did to others earlier, about having to leave for the memorial service. Representative Wasserman Schultz, having you here, I could not resist. I had asked Judge Alito several questions about the very deeply personal matter of Terri Schiavo from your State. I was offended, as many others were, at the number of people in elective office running before the cameras to try to grandstand in what was a terrible family tragedy. We saw them trying to overrule the State

of Florida. I forgot the number of times the State courts in Florida faced this issue.
Representative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Twenty. Senator LEAHY. Twenty. I knew it was a lot. Some Members of Congress were attacking the judges who upheld the State court rulings because it fit their political purposes. The Florida legislatures passed an unconstitutional measure allowing Governor Bush to intervene. Actually a colleague of yours in the other body even issued a congressional subpoena to prevent Terri Schiavo’s medical decisions. I mention this sad and somewhat outrageous conduct of people who know better, but in every single case were attacking the independence of the judiciary. Do you have a sense whether Judge Alito would be one who would value an independent judiciary? I ask this in light of the questions I have asked him on the unitary Executive, and the situation we now see where the President can sort of write sidebars to everything from torture legislation to spying. Representative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I think that that is an extremely important question, and Judge Alito’s record is emblematic of the problems with the Terri Schiavo case. His views on privacy are extremely important. In that case you had the Congress insert itself into a family’s private tragedy. You had the State legislature give our own Governor the unconstitutional right to overturn a judicial decision. You had, time and again, the Supreme Court rule that this was a matter that should be decided in State court, and decided not to take the case up. And I think it is a very important question. If that case had gone to the Supreme Court and you had the question of whether Congress actually had the right to insert itself into Terri Schiavo’s private family tragedy, how would Judge Alito have ruled? He has very troubling views about the power and the authority of the Executive, and I think that we need to make sure that we zealously guard our legislative authority and make sure that we have a Justice on the Supreme Court that supports the system of checks and balances, and I do not think that Judge Alito’s record demonstrates that he does. Senator LEAHY. Thank you. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your patience. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you. There are two more items that I want to cover, but we will first of all let the panel go. Thank you very much, Ms. Pringle, Congressman Gonzalez, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, Mr. White, Mr. Turner and Mr. Shaw. You have been a very enlightening panel, and I know how deeply all of your views are held. That is one thing we have seen in this hearing. Nobody is casual about Judge Alito. Everybody is very decisive. Emotions run deep. Two items I want to cover, one in a colloquy with my distinguished ranking member, that is the future schedule on Judge Alito, and then I intend to announce my own decision on my vote now that the hearing is over. The issue of scheduling has been extraordinarily difficult, as Senator Leahy and I have wrestled with that problem. Preliminarily, let me say that it has been a pleasure to work with Senator Leahy, and I think our collegiality has been demonstrated in many ways,

mostly by all of the pictures taken where we were huddled together so that our voice do not carry too far beyond, and also with a sense of humor. In the bad old days, when I had no hair, the only way that Senator Leahy and I could be told apart was by color of our ties.
[Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. Of course, you are still wearing the red tie. Chairman SPECTER. I am glad to have some hair. But the scheduling issue has been an important one, and it was a difficult issue as to when we would schedule these hearings. The President, as is well known, wanted the matter decided before Christmas, and it seemed to me that was not realistic. We had to do it right and not do it fast. And then the issue came up, OK, not before Christmas, then when? And I wanted to start the hearings the day after New Year’s. I wanted to start them on January 2nd. And the Democrats have a right, under our Committee practices, to delay for a week, and it seemed to me that that week could be given from the 2nd to the 9th, and that would be the week’s delay. Senator Leahy and I are under—we have a lot to consider. We have Committee members who have views, and we have caucuses which have views. But at any rate, we came to terms on what I thought was done, and Senator Leahy and I then went up to the radio-TV gallery, and I want to read a bit of the discussion which we had there. I do not do this in a legalistic sense to mind Senator Leahy. I do it to set the parameters as to where we have been and the views that my Committee members have and which I have. This is the transcript. But at any rate, Senator Leahy and I have worked through it, and said it could be delayed a week in any event by any Senator who wants to hold it over for a week, that we would put that week back at the start on the 9th with the good faith understanding that our intent would be to go to the Executive Committee meeting on the 17th, the day after the Martin Luther King holiday, so that the schedule will be that we will start hearings at noon on the 9th, will have them on Tuesday the 10th, Wednesday the 11th, Thursday the 12th, Friday the 13th, and Saturday the 14th if necessary. Then we will go to the Exec. on the 17th, and here we cannot get everybody bound in writing to waive in advance, but Pat Leahy and Arlen Specter have had no problems, nor have we anybody on the Committee of not fulfilling what we have said we would do as a matter of good faith intent, which would put the Executive Session on the 17th. We finished that with Chief Justice Roberts in the morning. And then we would go to the 18th, 19th and 20th for floor debate, with a vote on the 20th. There is more dialog, and Senator Leahy then put in a limitation, quote, ‘‘Obviously, this leaves room if something extraordinary comes up that neither, frankly, neither Senator Specter nor I anticipate or expect,’’ close quote. And I did not object to that. Seemed to me that that was a reasonable condition which might change what I had said earlier. It is my intention to adhere to that schedule and to set the Executive Committee meeting for next Tuesday, the 17th in Dirksen 226, our regular hearing room, at 11 a.m.

Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. Of course, we did this on November 3rd, and the discussion was had by—you are absolutely right, by Senator Frist, who was responding to the—I will not characterize it as pressure, but the direction he had received from the White House to move forward prior to Christmas. You may recall that Senator Frist had first said that the Senate would adjourn for the year in the first week in October, and then under every conceivable circumstance, the week before Thanksgiving, and instead there was a joyful singing of Christmas carols in the halls as we were finishing up just a few days before Christmas. Had we followed what the White House had told Senator Frist they wanted and gone before Christmas, of course, we could not have even had the hearing. We were having votes every 10 minutes. It would have been chaotic. It would not have been the dignified and thorough kind of hearing we had here. On January 2nd, of course, was a holiday, we could not come back that day and start the hearings. As I stated at the press conference, it would have meant destroying any of the staff’s attempt to have any time over the holidays with their families. They had lost much of the family time during the normal school vacations in August because we had to prepare for the Roberts hearings. This was, of course, the third nominee of the President for this seat. I would have much preferred, as you know, for a personal reason to have had it the first week during January because of long, long, long standing personal plans for this week, which I canceled, because otherwise it would have meant canceling everybody’s time with their families at Christmas. I had been told that a number of our members are going to be home for Martin Luther King events this weekend, will not be back on time on Tuesday, and so they will exercise their rights. And as you and I discussed privately prior to that press conference, of course, any Senator could exercise their right to put it over, a right that you and I—both of us have served as Chairman—something you and I have always protected. I understand from something the majority leader said that, again, even though the Court does not come back in until the latter part of February, that the White House has told him they want the debate to begin before the President’s State of the Union, even if we had—I do not have a calendar before me—but even if we put this over from next Tuesday to the following Tuesday, there is no reason why then it could not be on the floor on Wednesday, which is still 6 days prior to the State of the Union. Just in case you are wondering. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. This is about the first time Senator Leahy and I have not agreed on something, but there has to be a first time for everything. Senator LEAHY. I agree you are a superb Chairman. We can agree on that I hope. Chairman SPECTER. The reciprocity of respect, I think, is pretty evident, the way we have conducted these hearings. And I appreciate what Senator Leahy has said about the full and fair—and he used the word dignified—I think they are dignified. There is a

Latin maxim, the exception proves the rule. There might have been 4 minutes in the hearing when it was not dignified, but we worked through that as well. About the only thing the respective parties have been able to agree to on this whole proceeding is that Senator Leahy and I have functioned collegially and have produced a full and fair and dignified hearing.
As far as I am concerned, we are going to proceed on the 17th at 11, and if the right of the—
Senator LEAHY. The right of any Senator. Chairman SPECTER. Well, if they are held over, they are held over. I had thought we had—I do not fault Senator Leahy. I had thought that the Democratic Caucus knew what we were doing, and they certainly knew about it after we said it, but we will work through this problem like many, many others. This is not a gigantic problem. Senator LEAHY. I think one of the problems is that—whether this affected it or not, I think the fact that the time that we were going to wrap up the session, the time which is determined by the leadership, by the majority leadership, kept changing, kept changing almost day by day, by day, by day, by day, and it probably has put all the pressure on everything else. I would hope that we could work this out. Maybe you and I can—we have each other on speed dial at home, and Senator Specter has heard many descriptions about my farm house—let us get some of these hearings out of the way, and you and I can sit up there and have dinner and have a good time, but we will talk about this over the weekend. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Leahy. Let me now move to the final item of the Committee hearing, and that is the announcement of my position. And I intend to vote to support Judge Alito’s nomination for Associate Justice to the Supreme Court, and I do not do that as a matter of having a partyline vote or as a matter of party loyalty. If I thought that Judge Alito should not be on the Supreme Court, I would vote no, just as I did with Judge Bork. My commitment to the President as Chairman of this Committee is to give his nominees prompt hearings and to vote them out of Committee. And I have always believed in that. Before I became Chairman, I believed that there had been too many delays on both sides. Both Democrats and Republicans have delayed hearings on judicial nominees, and that led us to an escalation of events and filibusters and possibility of the constitutional or nuclear option. We have worked through that, and Senator Leahy and I were instrumental in avoiding what could have been a really cataclysmic event in the Senate. And I have always believed in voting people out of Committee. I recall the days when matters were bottled up in the Committee, and I never agreed with that. And I voted against Judge Bork in Committee, but I voted to send his nomination to the floor. So in fulfilling my commitments to the President and the Republican Caucus to have prompt hearings and to vote people out of Committee, I believed in that before I was Chairman, and I believe in it now. And after fulfilling those duties, whether I vote aye or nay, that is my independent judgment. Under separation of powers, Senators are separate from the executive branch. It would be inap-

propriate to make a commitment on a vote in advance in any way, and I prize that independence very highly.
With respect to Judge Alito’s qualifications, I think that they are agreed to, no doubt about the quality of his academic standing at Princeton and Yale or his erudition or his scholarship, working in the Solicitor General’s Office and Office of Legal Counsel, then 15 years on the bench. We could not have held these hearings when we did, into January, because there was so much to do. And this Committee has worked very, very hard, and I thank not only the members of the Committee but the staffs. The staffs of this Committee didn’t have an August. There was no recess to get ready for Judge Roberts’ hearings. We didn’t have a December or a November. We haven’t had much of a January.
Senator LEAHY. January is not too good so far. [Laughter.] Chairman SPECTER. But we wanted to do it right, and I think we have done it right. We have gone very deeply into Judge Alito’s background and studied his record. With respect to the answers which Judge Alito gave, there are going to be differences of views. I thought we had to hear his answers before coming to judgment, and I have urged colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to make up their minds before the hearings are over. There has been an enormous amount of publicity about Judge Alito, as there was about White House Counsel Harriet Miers. And as I have said before, Ms. Miers was run out of town on a rail. The nomination was decided in the radio talk shows, TV talk shows, on the op-ed pages, and not by the Committee, which is what the Constitution says should be done. The Senate should make the decision and it ought to have a hearing in this Committee. And we kept a level playing field for Judge Alito, and I was frankly a little concerned about the opening statements on both sides—a lot of accusations on one side and a lot of hyperbole on the other. And this is not a court of law, but I wanted Judge Alito to have a chance to explain where he stood and not to come to conclusions from the testimony. It was important to come from him. I think that his answers in a sense went farther than any in the past because he did not say that he would not respond because the case might come before the Court. He ultimately refused to give judgments as to how he would vote, but when the issue was raised, he discussed the considerations that would be involved on Executive power, a really very important subject, as to whether the resolution for the authorization of use of force comprehends authority to engage in electronic surveillance, and I don’t think it does. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is specific on that point. But we are going to have a hearing, and we hope to hear from— we expect to hear from the Attorney General on the question of whether there is constitutional authority for the President to override a statute because of his Article II power. Those questions were put to Judge Alito, and he responded with the kinds of considerations which would be involved. And I think he touched all the bases there, but he was not going to say how he was going to rule, nor should he.

When it came to the question of court-stripping and the amendment taking away habeas corpus jurisdiction from the Federal courts on detainees, I think that is an atrocious piece of legislation. I believe it will be declared unconstitutional. But when he was asked about that, he talked about the considerations involved, not how he was going to decide it.
And on congressional power, I think he agreed that the method of reasoning of Supreme Court Justices is not superior to the method of reasoning of Congress, and that there oughtn’t be flabby tests, as we talked about Justice Scalia’s dissent on the Americans with Disabilities Act.
When it came to Roe v. Wade, I think he went about as far as he could go. He started off by saying that he agreed with Griswold, a constitutional right of privacy in the Liberty Clause, and that it would apply to single people as well in Eisenstadt, and that when he was dealing with Casey, the issue of reliance was very important, that he thought it was critical by analogy to what Chief Justice Rehnquist had done in Miranda, that it was a critical factor as to whether a decision was embedded in the culture of the community. And I certainly think from my own point of view Roe is. And he agreed that it was a living Constitution, subject to change, as Cardozo said in Palco with the mores and values of the people.
And we had a lot of discussion as to his views on Roe v. Wade and what then-Judge Roberts had said. And from my reading, I don’t think there is a dime’s worth of difference between what Chief Justice Roberts said and what Judge Alito said about that. Both relied heavily on precedents, but said that they would not make a final commitment, nor should they have made a final commitment.
I think the judicial panel was very instructive, and there had been some precedents for it in the past, although this broke new ground in having as many testify as they did. And the practice after judges hear arguments to go into conference to discuss it is one which is not widely understood by people, and Judge Alito went into conferences. he and Judge Becker had sat on more than a thousand cases. I believe Judge Becker testified they disagreed only 15 times. Judge Becker received the Devitt Award as the Outstanding Federal Jurist a couple of years ago. Of course, I know Judge Becker very well because we went to college and law school together, and he has been a close friend. But he didn’t exert any undue influence on me. But he testified that Judge Alito had no agenda and was not an ideologue. And so did Chief Judge Scirica. And, of course, I know the Third Circuit because it is my circuit. I have argued a lot of cases in the Third Circuit and had a hand in the appointment of Judge Scirica to both the district court and the court of appeals, and Judge Barry.
And then I thought the testimony of Judge Timothy Lewis was very influential, and just a word about Judge Lewis. I first heard about him in about 1990 when he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Pittsburgh, an African-American. And Senator Heinz and I were very interested in diversifying the court, having an African-American. Hard to find a Republican African-American. Still is pretty hard to find. And when we found one, I wanted him on the district court bench. And I heard about him one morning in Pittsburgh,

saw him that afternoon in the hotel lobby, and talked to Senator Heinz about him the next day. And he was put on the district court, a very fast time, then on the court of appeals in 1992. And I have known him for more than 15 years, and when he says after knowing Judge Alito as he did, sitting with him, and Judge Lewis being dedicated to pro-choice and to civil rights, active on the ACLU and pro-choice, that he wouldn’t testify for him if there was a doubt in his mind, I thought that was significant.
We have gone beyond asking some of the witnesses what happens if Judge Alito is rejected. This was an issue in the Presidential campaign on both sides. Senator Kerrey said he would appoint someone who was pro-choice, and I think President Bush said he would not use a litmus test. And I don’t use a litmus test myself. But at least from those who have been reported in the press who would be considered, I put that question to Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz and to Ms. Kate Michelman, whom would they expect to find who would give more credence, thoughtfulness, and the precedents in the field.
Well, those are some of my reasons for supporting Judge Alito. I will prepare a written statement, but I thought it important to state my views now that the hearings are over. I know that I have already been asked many times by the press how I am going to vote, and I don’t want to be coy and I don’t want to hold back. And if the Senate was in session now, I would wait until the Senate was in session to go to the floor to make a statement. But that is how I think it through.
Senator Leahy? Senator LEAHY. I will just be very brief, Mr. Chairman. I was following with interest what you were saying, also the interest and the history in Pennsylvania—as you know, one of my favorite States. I visit there often, in fact, drive through there the one time a year when I drive to Vermont, usually during the August recess, this time with a trunkload weighted down with all of then-Judge Roberts’s writings. You had mentioned one thing about voting against a Supreme Court Justice in Committee, but then voting to go on the floor. I think that is a good practice. I joined you on that particular nominee. I had at least a couple nominees for the Supreme Court whom I voted against in Committee as I stated what my position was. But I then voted that they go to the floor of the Senate because I thought for a Supreme Court Justice, we ought to all at least follow the Senate procedures where a hundred of us could decide what procedure to follow and have a vote. That is one of the reasons why I felt so frustrated with the 61—you were not Chairman, but the 61 of President Clinton’s judicial nominees who were never allowed to have a vote in Committee but were basically pocket-filibustered. I thought it was a bad practice then. I think it is a bad practice, as I said, a lot of the partisanship that you and I have worked very, very hard to lower, that you and I have tried to go back to the type of Senate it was when both of us came here. I will work with you, of course, on the scheduling of this. I had obviously not realized, one, that we would go so late in the year, but, two, that we would have a number who are not prepared to vote on Tuesday and will just follow the normal rules. But there

772 will be no problem then in voting the following Tuesday. You have actually picked up a couple days by having the markup on a Tuesday, not a Thursday, voting the following Tuesday, and I guess it would be on the floor then Wednesday and off we go.
Excuse me. This is not emotion. It is a Friday afternoon voice. And as I said, I expect you and I will talk over the weekend. I admire you as a Senator. I admire your work as Chairman. I have often said that of all the Senators, you were my number 2 choice to be Chairman of this Committee.
[Laughter.] Senator LEAHY. Unfortunately, I don’t get my number 1 unless the Democrats are back in the majority. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much, Senator Leahy. Senator LEAHY. Thank you. Chairman SPECTER. Thank you very much for a full, fair, and dignified hearing. And that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the nomination hearing for Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. for the Supreme Court of the United States. [Whereupon, at 1:34 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.] [Questions and answers and submissions for the record follow.] [Additional material is being retained in the Committee files.]
