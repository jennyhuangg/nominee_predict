STATEMENT OF HON. EUGENE 3. McCARTHY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

Senator McGarr. thank you very much for your confidence, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that and also-
The CIIAIRm3AN. Speak a little louder. Senator MCCARTHY. I am pleased to be here with my colleague of
the Senate, Senator Mondale, and two members of the House of Representatives from Minnesota, to introduce to the Senate Judiciary Corn-
mittee Harry Blackmn, who has been nominated for the Supreme
Court. I would say I am pleasedl he was nominated for a number of rea-
sons, those affecting his person, what I know of him. I am also glad to have a nominee whom I can vote for. This will be the third nom-
inee-no, the fourth-I voted against, three. I am afraid I would be accused of general prejudice against the Sunreme Court. That has
never been the case. Judge Blackmun has a record which is familiar to, I am sure, most
of the members of this committee. I suppose half of you were on the committee when lie al)peared here in 1959 as the noliiee for tie. cir-
cuit, court. lie was al)l)roved then after adequate examination and, as I remember, without any objection.
IIe has served well as a lawyer in my State and on time circauit court has made a record which is open to everyone's admiration.
I have objection to only oie decision, not very serious objection. My delegation in Minnesota took a case before himi'on tihe principle of one liau, ole vote, in 1968 and lie as a member of the lmAnel decided that.

the time was not right, to ehtrry the one man, one vote principle back to the level of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor causes. I hope that when he is on tie.com and hasiliiote tiime to reflect,, if that same issue comes before him, that. that principle may be extended to the hegifting of
democracy. Mr. Chairman, I will now yield to my colleagues with a recomnen-
(lation to the cnminittee that dley 'fljlnp1ve Judge Blacknmun. 'rle CHAIRMAN. Senator Mondale.
STATEMENT OF HON. WALTER F. MONDALE, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA
Senator MfONDALE. Thank you, Mr. Chairmiffi members of the coinmittee. I am l)leasei tofappiear before this Committee for the purpose of introducing Jutdge Harry A. Blackinuni the President's nominee to be an Associate Justiceof the Supreme Court.
I gladly support this- noimnati6n, and I commend the President for clioosing such adistingIislied jfirist..
The word "scholarly" has iliostoften bt~en used to describe Judgye Iliackmifi,- iinfd I thiji k it is an apt descripttdn. lie left inesota to attend Ifnaard College onl a scholarship, where hie graduiated Sinia Cum Laude and as a membi er of Phi Beta Kappa. lie then went onl to the Hatrvared-Law School, working his way through
schol bytutoring in mathematics and by holding a variety of other jobs.
After graditafing from law school in 1932, Judge Blackhim retutned to Minnesota and served as a law clerk to .Judge John Sanborn, one of the most, distinguished judges in the history of that circit court.
He then began a long career as a member of one of Miniesota's most. prestigious law firms. While in private practice, lie taught. lawt' part time, first at the St. Paul College of Law in St. Paul and then at. the University of Minnesota. In 1950 he became the resident counsel of M]ayo Clinic and the other Mayo organizations.
By 1959 when lie was appointed to the U.S. Circuit Coilrt, Judge Blackniun had established a reputation as one of Mhnnesota's most brilliant attorneys. In his 11 years on the court of appeals, lie has served with great distinction.
Judge Blackinun is highly regarded by lawyers practicing before his court, and lie is known" particularly for Ihis expert opinions on complex taxation matters.
ie litbs-e.tablished a record as an able, fair, and understanding judge. His opinions are carefully written, and they demonstrate a clear respect, for judicial precedents.
Judge-Blackmun's character is perhaps best, described by his hometown paper, the Rochester Post-Bulletin, which said:
We know of no man In Rochester, or indeed In Minnesota, who Is move respected by close frionda and castrl acquaintances alike; who has a higher reputation for integrity; whose Judgment Is more respected.
WhIle his academle and professional record Is "a matter of record," so to speak, let It be added that just as a man-- man of personal Integrity-none can rate higher.
For the record, I am submitting a copy of this editorial, as well as a subsequent editorial from the same paper discussing the merits of this nomination.

But all that's vater over the dam. Judge Blackniun has been nominated and we believe tei Senate will find his academic, professional, judicial and personal qualifications eminently suited for the Supreme Courl.
There Is, of course, much speculation about what kind of a justice Blacknhmi will be. The White House press secretary said President Nixon considers hi to be a strict constructionist. Judge Blackmun himself commented to reporters: "I've beeni called liberal and conservative. Labels are deceiving. I call them (judicial decisions) as I see them."
Only history will tell what kind of a label fits him. Bult, as lie said, labels are deceiving. We're confident that, the kind of Supreme Court justice Harry Blackmun will be', will be a damned good one.
Senator MONDALt. As a Minnesotin, I am proud of the fact that such a qualified nominee is a resident of my State. I am sure that all Minnesotans share this pride.
Based on his past, career, there is little doubt. that Judge Blackmun will become a distinghisfed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I hope that this Cm)mpittee will recomifilend his confirmation.

STATEMENT OF HON. ALBERT H. QUIE, A ]REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA
Mr. Qeu. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
I appreciate the Committees courtesy in permitting me to alpe'ar today on behalf of my friend and constituent, the 1Ionli'able Harry Blackmun, a judge of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. When I first brought Judge Blackmun's qualifieations to the attention of P)resident-elect Nixon on November 26, 1968, 1 wrote as follows:
In my opinion, the superior talents and scholarly attainments and judicial accomplishments of Judge Blackmun attest to his eminent suitability to serve on the Nation's highest court. I believe Judge Blackinun's sound judgnment coupled with his scholarly approach will provide a partial solution at least to many of the problems our Nation faces.
Mr. Chairman, I am glad that President Nixon has agreed with that, assessment and has now nominated Judge, Blacknun as all Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Ile comes before you with a distillguished record of fair-minded justice, a record open for all to study.
In my years of association with him, I have never known the faintest suggestion of ias or prejudice toward any man or toward any principle of law or justice. Likewise, his )elsonal affairs, his con(luct on the bench and hisphilosophical views are an open book.
He is here t(, reSpond fully and frankly to this distinguished Committee in carrying 6ut. its constitutional resplonsibilities to the President. And I give to Judge Blacknun my unqualified endorsenment and urge this Committee to reconmend his confirmation to the full Senate without delay.

Thank you for tile privilege accorded by as a Minnesota lawyer, and

period of some 2 years when ,Judge Blackmuii was also practicing ill the eity. We were associated together in Bar Association activities and

I had'an opportunity to observe the way in which his fellow lawyers

regarded hin. I think it is fair to say, as has been said by those preceding me, that., no Minnesota lawyer stood higher in tie evaluation of

his professional colleagues than Harry Blackmun.

Following his move from Minneapolis to ROchester in 1950, I think

it is significant to note that. he continued that standard of excellence in

theopractice of law and that lie also moved to positions of leadership in

the coninlity and in his church. I have been interested in his decisions since he became a member of the circuit court. of appeals ill

1959 in our Eighth Circuit, and I find no jurist, who has the intellectual

equipment, the ability, the. industry and time fairmindedness of ,Judge

Harry A. Blackniun.

Like iy colleague, Congressman Quie, I was l)leased to urgo the President of the Uuiited States and the Attorney General to consider

his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. I am delighted that the

President has done so, and that lie shares our opinion of Judge.

Blackinun.

I am privileged to recommend to this committee that it recommend

to the Senate his prompt. confirmation as Associate Justice of the IT.S.

Supreme Court.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

STATEMENT OF HON. QUENTIN N. BURDIOK, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA

Senator BURDICK. Mr. Chairman, my colleagues, you have heard from the Minnesota depart inent. of the Eighth Cirlit. I think you should hear from a neighboring State, North Dakota, which is also a member of the Eighth Circuit. I would like to give the committee the benefit, of conneits made by the two North Dakota members of the circuit court. One is the recently retired senior judge Charles J. Vogel and the other is the acting jude, Judge Myron Bright.
Here is what Charles Vogel has to say. He said:

The nomination of Blackmnun Is tremendous. I think President Nix-on could

not make He is one

a finer choice than Judge Blackmnun. of the finest persons I could think of

I think he is highly qualified. for the Supreme Court.

And Judge Bright says:
11 has a fine legal mind. le Is an exceptional scholar. Any opinion of his Is well written. I think that anyone who has read his opinions will agree that this man Is certainly an outstanding judge.
So, hrofar the opinions of two circuit court judges who have served with 'Judge HIarry Blackifin. I think they testify a.s to his competence and high qualifications.

lion. JA.MES 0. EASTLAND, Chairman, Scitatc Committie on the Judiciary, WasIthigton, D.C.
DRAR SENATOR: This letter is submitted in response to your telegram of April 16, 1970 inviting the Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary of tile Amerieanr Bar Assoelation to submit its opinion regarding Honorable Harry A. Blacknuni of Minnesota who has been nominated to is, an A sociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United State.
Based on its investigation to (late our Committee is of the opinion that .Tidge Blackmuni meets high standards of professional competence, temperament and Integrity. Our investigation is continuing and we soulhl like the privilege of submiting a further report to your Committee after the conclusion of Its hearings. Rather than making this report unduly long, we state our conclui-ons and ,;hall be happy to supply further detail upon request.
Our committeee does not express any opinion as to political or ideological matter4. Its opinion is limited to the professional competence, temperament and integrity of the nominee.
The investigation of the Committee as presently expanded, has included the following steps:
1. It has interviewedl Judge Blackmun. 2. It has made its own survey of Judge Blackmin's opinions. 3. It has interviewed all members of the Eighth Circuit ('ourt of Appeals. 4. It has Interviewed the Chief Judges of each of the district Courts within the Eighth Circuit and a number of other federal and state judge within that Circuit. 5. It has Interviewed and had reports from over 100 lawyers within the Eighth Circuit who are in active practi e and who would be most likely to be familiar with Judge Blackmun's reputation in the ('ircuit. It has Interviewed the deans of four law schools within the Eighth Circuit. 7. It has Interviewed a substantial number of judges and some lawyers outside the Eighth Circuit. 8. It has interviewed the deans of more than 25 law schools outside the Eighth Circuit. 9. It has carefully considered the Mixteen paige letter dated April 15, 1970 to you from i)eputy Attorney General Richard G. Kleindlenst. Except for two instances hereafter related, none of the scores of persons interviewed commented adversely regarding .Judge Blackmun and all those who knew him or who were familiar with his work state that lie Is highly qualified.
PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDI
Judge Blackiiun has had broad general exprleince in law and business which glve.s him an excellent background for judicIal work. lie has served as a Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit for some eleven years. lie worked as the law clerk to Judge Sanborn of that Court in 19,33. Ile practiced law in a leading Minneapolis firm for sixteen years. -or five years he engaged Intensively in tax work, for two years in general litigation and for ten years li, slxcialized iti wills, trusts, estate llanning and taxes ani bank work. For nine years, lie was engaged as business,; manager amm(gl eneral counsel of the Mayo Clinic. lie taught law school for eight years, six of them at VIIIIam Mitchell College of Law night schodI during the 1930's and two of them at the University of Minnesota dluringthe facility Shortage following Worhl War II. .ludge llaeknuin has done considerable comnittee work in the Federal Court system by serving on the Advisory Committee on Research to the Federal Judicial Center, and the ABA Criminal .ustice. Standards Project's Advisory Committee on the Judges' Ful(tio. lie has partihilated ii numerous community activities.
1. Judge Ilia(knun itterview.-Judge tiaekmun was interviewed and im-
pressed us as a judge %Ahe is sincere, fraiik, understandlng :nd cooperative, one who conscientiously and with open mind weighs every reasonable argument with careful kovledge of the record, the arguments and the law.
2. Survey of .Judge Bhlacknlm's OpInions.-Our survey included opinions written by liin in various fields of law. They are scholarly and well written, with a consclousnmess of broad social policies involved and with a perception of current trends of tire law. They-may be characterized as lengthy but they have Indicated

10
to losing counsel and to the Supreme Court on review that all arguments have been considered and weighed In a fair Manner by the court.
The substantive areas covered by Judge Blacknun's opinions include a wide range of subjects, lie is particularly familliar with tax law, lie Ias written frequently with respect to criminal (-ases. lie has also written a number of opinions it the field of labor relations. Other than that his opinions run the usual wide variety of the Pederal courts, including matters of administrative law, patents
and trademarks, bankruptcy, and the questions of tort and contract law which come before the Federal court because of the diversity of citizenship of the
parties. lie has written some civil rights opinions and some of his (rilhinal .ase.i present civil rights Issues and basic constitutional iIsues, lie has written few antitnst opinions.
3. Members of Ihe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.-Ills colleagues have unanimously endorsed him as well qualified. .Nudge lilackmun its described by a former Chief Judge of this court as "the best qualified man in the Eighth Circuit * * * a consclentious hard worker and a good scholar."
4. Other Federal anti State Judges Within the Eighth Circuit.-These Judges Include the judges whose decisions are reviewed by the Court of Appeals of which Judge liacknini is a member.
The former Chief Judge of the l)istrict of Minnesota, one of the most respected trial Judges In thu country, writes of him in the following terms: "lle is a gifted, scholarly judge who has an unusual cal)acity for the production of opliftnis if ihe cases assigned to him on that cotirt which present learned treatises of the factual and legal questions Involved. And coupled with all of his erudition. lie Is massuing, kind and considerate in all of his a.oclations with tile liar and the public. ie has been nildcal Appellate .Jidge. I recommend him unreservedly to the Senate for the approval of his appointment."
The other federal judges support thi.s view as do state court judges in the Circuit.
5. Lawyers of the Eighth Circult.-The lawyers Interviewed practice in Minnesota, North l)akota, South Dakota. Nebraska. Iowa, Missouri and Arkansas. They include black lawyers and white lawyers, lawyers for labor unions, for
plaintilffs in personal Injury cases, for railroads, and for corporations and insurance companies, civil rights lawyers, president and past *presilents of State liar Associations, in short. a fair cross section of tihe liar. With a single excel-
tion, their comments were substantially the same as those of the judges, that Judge Blackmnun is' all excellent judge, one of tie best in tile Circuit, and that they had never heard an.thimg derogatory about hin. The exception believed that Judge Iliackmnun had a bias against labor union;'. Several other lawyers representing labor unions stated that Judge illackntmun was an exceptionally fine Judge,
that he was open minded and that ,they favored his appointment. 6. leans of Eighth Circuit Law Schools.-AWith the exception of one dealn who
was just appointed and who did not know Judge ltlackmun, all spoke strongly it his favor. Among those who knew Judge Blackinun hest was Dean William B. Lockhardt of the Unuiver.ily of Miniesola. immediate past President of tho Association of American lMw Schools. lie considered time appointment to be an excellent one. Ile spoke of Judge Illackinun as a "legal scholar and a very careful lawyer." lie saild further "his opinions are those of a first class legal craftsman. They would reflect high credit upon the Suprenme Court."
7. Judges and LJawyers Outside tile Eighth Circult.-Outshe the Eighth Circuit Jndge illackmun Is less well known but lie is well regarde-, by those ,,who know hii. lie is known by the chief judges of most circuits and hy other judges who have served on Committees with him. Those who know hin1all speak well of him both as a mun and as a judge.
8. facultyy Members of Law Schools Outside the Eighth Circult.-The deans of a substantial number of representative law schools thronghoht the country were interviewed, as were some professors in those law schools. Judge Blackinun is best known in the Mild-West. However, in many of tile law%- schools his iamie has been discussed by faculty and students. Nonie of the faculty members Interviewed had any unfavorable comments. Those who had had occasion to examine hits opinions believed them well written. The [AIw .Journal Editors of one law school expressed some concern that Judge lilackminf' might be too subservient to precedent aid lack sympathy for the defndntali Iff'(41rhilm l cases.
9. Judge Blackinun's "Financlal Holdings and Off-Bench Activities" as )escribed in the Kliendienst Letter at Pages 8 through 15.-The Committee studied this letter and discussed these matters with Judge llackmnun. The

information had been voluntarily given by Judge Blackmun. In our discussion he added another slilillar case and explained tie circumstances.
In tile opinion (of the Committee none of the instances including stock holdings, executor's fees, directorships in charitable or business corporations, changes our favorable conclusion. Judge Blackiun Ihas previously resigned his directorships in business corporations and'he has stated that he will resign his charitable directorshlps if confirmed. Ills stock holdings are so small that iln our opinion he Violated no statute or Canon.
In the Iersonal interview, Judge Blackmiun thoroughly explained the matters mentioned to the Senate Committee by Mr. Kleindienst in his letter. As to the stock in Ford Motor Company, even though his stock interest was not substantial, lie immediately recognized tile possible existence of an ethical prollem, and look appropriate ai.tion by discussing it with the Chief Judge of his court. After being told that he should participate and not disqualify himself, lie Also followed that advice In the second Ford case and a later case Involving Northwestern Bell Telephone. Judge lBlackmun's action in recently disqualifying himself in a case Involving a Ford subsidiary reflects am awareness of the controversy and publicity which had occurred regarding judicial stockholdings within lhe last year.
In the course of our interview we learned that Judge Blackniun had further reviewed the decisions in which lie had participated in order to ascertain if there were any other instance. Checking some 700 cases it the limited time available,-the only comparable case lie discovered involved Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company in which lie had bought some 30 shares of stock for approximately 2,2.50 on December 29, 1960 after having been a member of the court which decided a patent case against that company on December 1. 1960. Thereafter the Inel of the court of which he was a member denied the company's petitiou for rehearing.
Judge Blackmun also detailed to the Committee his services as an executor and the receipt of fees from two estates as described by Mr. Kleindlenst onl
page 15 of his letter, liW said that these had beeIn quickly discerned because they were reported on his income tax returns, lie subsequently recalled there was a 'third case in which fie acted as a co-executor for the estate of Dr. Donald C. Balfour, tile son-in-law of Dr. Fill Mayo, whose will was drawn it June, 1M39. Dr. Balfour died in July, 19Gk3 and Judge Blackmun acted as coexecutor at th6 insistence of the widow. lie received no fie.
We assured ourselves that in all of lhe.e cases the wills had been drawn before lie became a judge amid lie did no legal work regarding ti estate. In each of the cases the estate was represented liy counsel, a bank was a co-exectutor and tile decdents and surviving relatives had been close personal friends of .Judge illacknun and associated with tile Mayo Clinic to such a degree that he felt obligated to serve. We also learned that Judge Blackinun had (dhihled imany other requests to act as executor.
Our interview also included discussions of directorships and trusteeships held by .Judge llackmun as related in Mr. Klelindlenst's letter to you on page 14 and confirmed that Judge BlackniUn had resigned as an active director of the Kiier Corporation which operated a chain of hotels shortly after tile Judicial Conference indicated thmt such directorships were not advisable.
lie presented serves without compensaIon as a member of the Kahiler Cor-
poratlon Fouidatlon which Is a charitable corporation. lie still serves as a director of the ('harle-. 0. (ilflllan Foundation aind the Fanny S. (ilflllan Foundation, both of which were established by benefactors (of the Mayo Clinic to
provide anonymous charitable assistance to tie poor Ieople who needed medical help. lie is a trustee of W\illinam Mitchell College of Law, the Rochester letho. (list Hospital nmi tell 0ard of P'ublications of the Methodist churchh . lie was a trustee of lIamline University until Iis recent resignation. Judge Blackmun stated that if lie should be confirmed lie intends to terminate all these relal Ionshil s.
CONCLUSION
i the course of our investigation some persons commented flint Judge Blackimn was not nationally known and that soie of his opinions were unduly extended atd that lie was accordingly slower than others i the disposition of his cases. Lack of national reputation is not unusual for highly competent federal Judges whose work is primarily in their own circuit and we do not coiisder llIs an impediment. We were reassured in our interview tlt Judge Ilackmun recognizes the need for aim Associate Justice of the Supreme Court to work rapidly and

deal with an enormous vohune of work under great time pressure and we believe that lie would be able to meet the challenge.
Accordingly, upon the basis of our investigation to date, our Conmittee is unanimously of the view that Judge Blackinun meets high standards of professlonal competence, temperament :nd integrity.

2. Opinim s for the Court of Appeals. Because of Judge Blackmun's experience in tax law, he has written a number of opinions dealing with federal taxation for the Court of Aploeals. In areas of greater public interest and controversy, such as criminal law, civil rights, and civil liberties, the following paragraphs summarize representative opinions written by Judge Blackmun.
In Bailey v. Henslce, 2S7 F. 2d W36(1961), Judge Blackmun wrote for the court inreversing a decision of the federal district court and holding that a Negro defendant had made a l)rima face case that Negroes had been systematically excluded from the state court jury which tried hin. In Ncal v. System Board of Adjustment, 34S F. 2d 722 (1905), Blackmun wrote for the court in upholding the contention of a railway labor union that Negroes claiming raclhl discrimina-
tion against them on the part of their union were not entitled to prosecute their claim i the federal courts, because they had not exhausted their remedies %ithiln tile union.
In two cases involving claims by Negro facility members of discrimination against them, Judge Biackmun wrote opinions for the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circult reversing district court judgments against the teachers. Senith v. Board of Education of Morrilton School District No. 32, 365 F. 2d 770 (1906) Yarbrough v. Ifullcrt-Wcst Memphis School District, 380 F. 2d 962 (1907).
In Jones v. .llaycr, 379 F. 2d 33 (1967), Judge Blackmn wrote for the court inholding that a civil rights statute passed during reconstruction (lays was not a nationwide open-hiousing law which prohibited private, as well as public, discriminfition. Time Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit, 392 U.S. 409, holdIng that the old civil rights statute prohibited even private discrhinlation it tile sale or rental of property. The majority opitnion was written by Justice Stewart Justices Harlan and White dissented.
Kemp v.Bcaslcy, No. 19,782 (March 17, 1970), was the third round of school desegregation litigation concerming an Arkansas school district. Judge Blackmuni wrote for the court ulholdig part of the district court's judgment, but remanding that portion which had pennitted continuation of four "racially identifiable and completely y black" elementary schools.
Criminal Late Decisioms. In two cases involving federal habeas corpus claims by Negroes who had beien convicted of raping white women in Arkansas, the issite has been raised as to whether such defendants were discriminated against in that they allegedly received tie death penalty in circumstances in which a white rape defendant would not have received it. In Mitchell v. Stcphens. 353 P. 2d 129 (1905), Judge Blacktumn wrote for the court in rejecting the constitutional clain, although remanding the ease because of an error with respect to the admissioI of the defendant's confession. In Maxwell v. Bishop, 398 F. 2d 138
(190), lBlackmtmm wrote for the court in aflirming a district court. judgment denying habeas corpus relief and overruling a similar constitutional contention. lie .sil: "We are not yet ready to condemn and upset the result reached in every case (of a Negro rape defendant in the State of Arkansas on the basis of broad theories of social and statlstical Injustice. This is particularly %oon a record so spefflc as this omme. And we are not yet ready to nullify this ljtitioner's Garland County trial omi the basis of results generally, but elsewhere, throughout time South." 398 F. 2d at 147.
Maxcell v. Bishop is presently under submission in tie Supreme Court of
the United States. Pope v. United States. 372 F. 2d 710 (1967), was an appeal from a judgment
of a district court imapesing thle death sentence on a bank robber who killed three employees of a bank in tie process of robbing It. It was heard ellbalc by the Court of Alppeals, and Judge Blackman wrote a long opinion pil)holding the judgmmnt of conviction, The opnilon contains an exhaustive discussion of the defense of insanity. The Supreme Court later vacated tie sentence and remanded the ease for resentencing after lhe Solicitor General (oncededthat this death penalty provision suffered from the saine constitutional infirmity as the Supreme Court had fo nd to exist in Inited States v. Jackson; ,Iustices Black and White da-sented for reasons expressed in their disselting opillons in Jackson. 392 U.S. 651 (1968).
"The 'ommlitee on the Judge's Function. chaired by District Judge Frank Murray of Mmmsach.wetts-. Is the Inost recently established of a series of committees dealing with various a~iwcts of tle definition and implementation of minimim standards in the adminIstratlon cofcriminal Justice.

In Deckard v. UWited States, 3S1 F. 2d 77 (1007), Judge Blackmun wrote for

the Court of Appeals In reversing a conviction under tie National firearms Act,

on the ground that the registration provision was unconstitutional because it

required self-incrnilnatton in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Supreme

Court a few nmontlis later reached the same result by a vote of -even to one

Inlilanesv. United State*, 390 U.S. 85 (1968),

In Jackson v. Bixhop, 404 F. 2d 571 (1908), Judge Blackmun wrole for the

Court of Appeals in holding that any use of a strap on convicts in the Arkansas

State 'enitentiary wai a cruel and unusual punishment und-r tile Constitu-

tion. Ills opinion pointed out that only two states still permitted the use of

a strap.

In Ashe v. Str¢eson, Judge Illackunn's opinion upheld the conviction of a

defendant against a claim of double jeopardy arising out of two successive
trials for the robbery of two different victims who had been playing in the .Rame

poker game. lie relied on two Supreme Court precedents that were of obviously

uncertain weight because of the turnover in tihe Justices of the Court, and stated:

"This court is not the Supreme Court of the United States. We therefore are not

free to disregard an existing flat and still ive holding of the Supreme Court

even though that holding is one by a sharply divided tribunal and even't|hough

only one of the Justices who participated In the majority decision remains active. A change In constitutional concept and the overruling of an existing dci-

sion, if indicated at all, is for the Supreme Court anti Is not for us.. Firmnqss of

precedent otherwise could not exist." Ashe v. Siwcenson, 399 F. 2d 40at 45- 968).

The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals in an

opinion headed down on April 0, 1970. JftJ§tIce Stewart Spoke'for the majority,

and Chief Justice Burger dlssented. The majority opinion noted that the

operative facts in time case were virtiully Identical to the facts i the earlier case of Hoag v. Ncw Jersey, 356 U.S. 464, In which the Supreine Court had twelve

years earlier lph?ld a conviction utlder similar circumstances.

lit Slaeek v. United Stales, No. 19.462 (July 28, 1969), Judge Illackin

wrote for the court in upholding a federal criminal conviction against a col-

lateral attack by tihe defendant. One of the prisoner's claims was that the

denial of the right to subpoena witnesses at government expense deprived him

of the equal protection of the laws, even though it had been earlier determined

that such witnetsses would not have been able to testify to any relevant fact.

Judge Blackniun's response to this point was: "Ini any event a rich defendant

may have the right to waste is money oI unnecessary a,dfolish steps, but

that does not, thei name of necessary constitutlonal equality, give the in-

dligent the right to squander government funds merely for the asking."

In United States v. Bonds. Judge Iliacknmin dIsiented from a majority holdIng of the Eighth Circuit which reversed a federal conviction on th, grolld

that evidence should have been suppressed. lie expressed the view that flie

ssearch li question had beei reasonable under the rules prevailing prior to the

Supreme Court's decision in Chinict v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (199), and

that lhe rule a(lopted by tie Fifth Circuit that Chimet wvas not retroactive

should be likewise applied by the l3ghth Circuit.
Ciril Liberties Di.visions. In steban v. central Missouri Stale College, No.

19,565 (Aug. 2S, 199 ), the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circutlldiviled as

to whether the constitutional rights of students at a publicly suPisxirled college

[it Missouri had been violated in Ihe course of their expulsion. judgee lBlackmnun

wrote for the majority aflirming the judgment of the district court holding

that tie .udents had ben properly expelled, anid expre.slng lisagreemnent with

an apparently contrary rllig of Judge Doyle In lhe Western i)lstriht of Wisconsin (Sogl%,m v. Kaulflman, 295 F. Stlip. 978, in which the latter had truckk down

university regulations for "ovcrhreadth"). The majority of time court held that

tihe finding by the university officials that one of the expelled studenlts had

participatel il tile demonstration was supported by evidence. Certioarl has Ien sought in the Supremue Court, but tie Court has not yet acted on the

petition (No. 1026 OT 1959). In re lII'itzman (No, 19,446, April 7. 1970) was a naturallzation case in which tie three-Judge panel of time Court of Appeals

produced three different opinions. Judge Blackmun diss.,ented front the holding of time inajorlty of ihe court Ihat petitioner wa, entitled to naturallation. since

he felt that there was no constituitlonal objection to denying naturalization to an

alien because con.elentious objection to war was bast-id on a l~er~onnl moral

code, rather than on religious training amid belief. Inthe flinal parilgraph ,f hIs

that we cannot go that ftir even in this permissive day."

3. Financial Hloldings and Off-Bench Aclirilic.i. Judge lackinun reviewed

with the Department of Justice, prior to the submission of his nomination to he

an Associate .Justle of ihe Supreme Court, his financial holdings, his practi(e

respecting disqualifleatifon bectue of interest or relationship, and his off-bench

activities. lie is entirely agrieabie to making available to the committee e any

dcltl financial hitforhition which it desires at tie al)rolprlate litle. Judge

Blackniun's net mately $75,000

worth is in stocks,

ln lie bonds,

ffelghorhodd of $125,000 and hank accounts, and

consisting of flpproxiapproximately $50,0(0

represented by his equity in his family home in Rochester, Minnesota.

in ihe light of the extended delairs over the confirmation of .udge Ilayns-

worth, Jlge Illackmun requested the advice of tile Departnent, and requested

the Departnient to call to the attention of tie Judiclary ('ommittee, the fol-

lowing slecific situations.

WJtork in Ford Motor Co. & American Tel. & Tel. In October, 1957, prior to assuming the bench, Judge Blackmun purchased fifty shares of stock in Ford Motor (ompaly, at a total purchase price slightly in excess of $2,500. Approximately six months after becoming a circuit Judge, lie artliclpated i the (leesi~lo of the ('050 of Haffonf v. Ford Motor ('ompanyi, 278 F.2d 586 (1900). Prior to doing so, Judge hliackinun recalls dist.uwsing tie matter with (lien Chief Judge Johnsen of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and concluding that his Interest in the case was dc mninls and that he should not disqualify himself, lie wrote the opinion of hie Court of Appeals, directing the district

court to reinstate a jury verdict in the amount of $24,600 which had beenl rendered against tile Ford Motor Company, but which the district court had set

aide.

Four years lat& Judge Blackmun was a member of a panel of the Court of

Appeals which heard and decided the case of Kotda v. Ford Motor CJompany, .33S

F. 2d 732. In that case, Judge Matthes wrote the opinion of the court, uphold-

lng a judgment of the district court which had set aside a Jury verdict of

$12,500 In favor of the plaintiff.

In January, 1970, Judge Blackmun received notice of his assignment to a

cael in. which a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. Gateway

Ford '1'?Iek Sales, was a party. In view of the national attention that had

focused on'the issue of disquailficaioIn as a result of the debates over the confirmation of'XJudge flaynsworth, Judge lIiackmun advised Chief Judge Van

Oosterhout that lie regarded himself as disqualified, and the ease was assigned

by the Chief;Judge to another panel. Bridgcman v. Gatcway Ford Truck Sales,

Docket No. 19,749 (Feb. .1, 1970).

)urlng 1963 and 1904, Judge Blackmnun acquired 22 shares of American Tele-

phone anl Telegraph Company stock, at a total cost of approximately $1,350.

In 1907, lie participated in the decisions by the Court of Appeals of Mahoney v.

Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, 317 F. 2d 519 (1967). Ini that case, the

Court of Appeals in a brief per curim opinion tipiel(i the judgment of tile

court below which dismissed the plaintiff's complaint for lack of diversity jufris-

(fiction as-required by statute. Tie plalnltiff had prayed foi $35,000 damages,

alleging that lie was a citizen of Nebraska and that the defendant Northwestern Bell Teleplhne Company was, for Jurisdictional purposes, all Iowa

corporation. Tile Court of Appeals lplied tile district judge's ruling that tile

defendant was a Xebraska corporation, and therefore both the plaintiff all( the

defendant were citizens and residents of the somie state.

The statute governing disqualification for federal Judges is 28 U.S.C. 455,

which provides in pertinent part as follows: "Any justice or judge of the United

States shall (isqualify himself in any case in which lie has a substantial

Interest .....

The departmentt of Justice has advised Judge Bllackniun that in its opinion

lie dhl not have in any of these three cases such a "substantiallinterest" as

would require 1h1m to dilsqualify hfinself. By any quantitative standards, Judge

lackhnulrl's interest In the two Ford eases call only be described as microscopic.

In 19060, lie owned fifty shares out of more than 16,000,000 issued and outstand-

Ing. in 1904, lie owlled 100 out of more than 52,000,000 shares issued and

outstanding common stock. The '24,500 jury award Involved lin Ifanson Is like-

wise hut tiny fraction of Ford's 19 0 nel income of approximately $427,000,000,

and the $12,500 award involved in Kolida is an even tiller fraction of Ford's

1904 net income of approximately $505,000,000.

16
Judge Blackmun's holding of 22 shares of American Telephone and Telegraph Company stock in 1967 must be related to the nearly 54A0.000,000 shares outstanding in 1967. The $35,000 prayed for lky the plaintiff In Mahoney is an infinitesimal portion of American Telephone and Telegraph Company's 1967 net Income of approximately one and one-half billion dollars.
In short, If the word "substantial" In 28 U.S.C. 455 is to be given any meaning at all, Judge Blacknmun was not required to disqualify himself In any of
these three cases. On facts which can be described as virtually identical, Chief Judge Brown.
speaking for the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sitting en baIne, held that a federal district judge was not disqualified under the statute, stating: "The ownership of 100 shares of hlumble stock is not, and was nlot, either as a matter of law or fact or both a disqualifying factor. The record shows without contradiction that the 100 shares owned by the trial Judge were ani ininltesnlial portion of the 36 million shares outstanding when the case was tried . . . This tiny fractional Interest in the equity ownership of this huge Industrial enterprise does not amount, either as a matter of fact, or law, or both, to a substantial Interest by the trial Judge In the case or a prohibited connection with the litigant." Kitincar-ll'ccd Corp. v. llumble Oil and 11cfiti y Co., 5th Cir., 403 F. 2d 437 (191S).
The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has expressed similar views in the case of somewhat larger stockholdings, in ann order handed down in October, 1969, In the South Louisiana area rate cases. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York came to a shnilar conclusion vith respect to a small number of shares in a large public corporation in Lampcrt v. Hollis Music, Ite., 105 F. Supp. 3 (1952).
Canon 2), American Bar Association Cauions of Judicial Ethics, provides that "a Judge should abstain from performing or taking part in any judicial act in which his personal interests are involved." The terin personall Interests" Is not defined, though Formal Opinion No. 170-states that a Judge who Is a stockholder In a corporation which Is a party to litigation pending in his court should not perform any judicial function with respect to that law suit which involves ant exercise of discretion.
The relationship between the federal statute pertaining to disquallfleation, 28 .S.C. 455, and Canon 29 is far from clear. Different language Is used In eachi, and the absence of tile adjective "substantial" In the Canon suggests that it may impose a stricter test than the statute. IIowever, In tile light of the extremely small amount, both absolutely and proportionally, of Judge Blacknun's holdings In the corporations Involved, this would appear to be an appropriate case for the application of the rule of "tde mnimifs non cmrat icr" In interpreting Canon 29 and Formal Opinion 170. Theldc mi(nml, )rinciple in no way Impairs the safeguarding of both the fact and appearance of impartiality which the Canon rightfully demands of our Judges, and yet it permits a comimon-.esel.,, application of tile rule where a Judge's interest is genuinely insignifleant. The underlying question under the Camion. is whether .Judge Blhackimun either acted with partiality or created an appearance of partiality In the above-entitled cases. In fhe opliloni of the Department, he did neither.
In CoMMowcralth Coailns C-po-atloni v. ('Onl4imnl(Il 0'a*ually Co.. 393 U.S. 145 (1968), the Supreme Court of the United States hehl that all arbitrator was disqualifled under (lie Federal Arbitration Act because of his "close business; conectloils" with one of the parties to tile arbitration. Tile facts of Commonw-ealth, however, show that the arbitrator's relationship with one of the partles to the arbitration was both a gowl deal more personal n( a good deal more substantial than was the relationship between Judge Blackmun and the Ford Motor Company which resulted from his owning fifty shares of its common stock.
The Supreie Court in Tumicy v. Ohio, 273 IRS. 510 (1927), held that It was a denial of constitutional due prc-e.s; for a criminal defendant to be tried before the local mayor whose Income would lie directly and measurably increased if lie convicted, rather than acquitted, tile defendant. While the amount of increment to tie judge's Income from any particular conviction might be small, tile dlireeiess of that relationship contrasts markedly with tit(e extremely remote relationship between any decision by Judge Blackmun in one of these three cases, and any possible benefit that might accrue to him as a result of such a decision. The court in Tunmcr said: "limit It certainly violates the Fourteenth Amendment, and deprives the defendant in the criminal case of die process of law, to subject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court tie Judge

17
of which has a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary Interest in reaching a conclusion against hilit this case."
Nor does the i)epartnent believe .udlge llackmun committed any Impropriety in recusing himself from the (laticajl case it February 1970. Tile intervening Senate debate over the confirmation of Judge Ilaynsworth had focused critical attention on the language of the statute, the provisions of the alolicale Cations of Ethics, and the interrelationship between the two. The vote by a majority of the Senate to refuse to advise and .oiisnit to the Ilaynsworth nominaon could fairly be deemed an Interpretation of the relevant provisions regarding dIsqualification which suggested a stricter standard than had obtained previously.
Cation '2) of the Amnerican Bar Assoviation's ('ahions of .Judicial Ethics states: "A judge shouhl abstain from making perosnal Investments ili enterprises which are apt to be ivohlrCd in liItiation i the courts . . ." (Emphasis added.)
If this Canon were Intended to preclude a judge from owning any stock in a corporation which might "poss-iply" be involved in litigation, then it would prevent a judge from owning any stock since every corporation might "possibly" be involved In litigation. If the drafters of this Canon had Intended this result, they could easily have provided for such an outright prohibition. Instead, they only slated that it was improper for a judge to invest in enterprises which are "apt" to he Involved in litigation. Webster's Dictionary defines "apt" -s "having an habitual tendency or inclination."
Dircetorship of the Kahicr Corporation. For slightly more than four years following hls taking the bench, Judge Ilaekmun was a director of the Kabler Corporation, which operated a hotel in Rochester, Minnesota. While serving as a director, he received annual director's fees front the corporation in the amount of $1,500. Following tihe adoption by the Judicial Conferenee of the United States of a resolution in the fall of 190.3 recommending that federal judges not hold offices or directorshlips in corporations organized for profit, Judge Bilackmun submitted his resignation as a director of the Kahler Corloration. Ills resignation was accepted in January, 1964.
Judge Bllackmun has advised he )epartment that he participated In deciding no cases Involving the Kahler Corporation at any thne since hits alpoiltmeint
to the bench. VYxccutor's rces. Following his accession to the bench, Judge Bllackiunit received
exietor's fees from two estates li which lie served as co-executor. Duing the calendar year 1962, lie received an executor's fee of $3.500 from
tWe estate of Mabel F. C. Kahler. Mrs. Kahler's will was executed on March 2'2. 1951, and named .Juge Blacknmtn as one of four (o-executors. Mrs. Kfihler died on September 20, 1958, and left an estate of approximately one-half million dollars.
Judge Blackmun also served as co-executor for the estate of Charles Giifillan, having been designated as such il the (hilftllanm will. Mr. ifllan1 executed his will lin October, 1955, and died Ill 1)(K.eilsr 1%12, leaving an estate valuel ii exes, of one and one-half million dollars. During calendar year 19(1, Judge llackmnun received 3,500 as an exectuor's fe, from thi. estate, anda during time calendar year 1W5 lie received $1, 500 from tile same source.
('anon 27, American liar Assoclation Canons of Judicial Ethics, provides as follows: "While a Judge is not disqualified from holding executorships or trusteeshilps, lie should not accept or continue to hold any fiduciary or other position if tile holding of It would interfere or seem to interfere with the proper lerformnince of his judicial duties, or if the business Interests of those represented require Investments in enterprises that are apt to come before hin julicially. or to be Involved in questions of law to lbe determined by him."
Informal Opinion No. 640 of the American liar Association Committee on Professional Ethics is snmtnarized as follows on page 217, American liar Assoclitlon Opinions of the Committee on Professional Ethics (1907 edition): "A judge should accept fiduciary aplointments after taking the bench only where a family relationship Is Involved or the judge Is specifically nominated or appointed by tie terms of the will or trust document."
Since .Judge Blackmun was named in the will of each of these decedents, and since there is no Indication that the holding of tir' executorship either Interfered
or seemed to Interfere with the proper performance of his duties as a federal appellate judge, Judge Iglackmun's serving as executor it these two estates, appears to have been entirely voh slstent with lhe provisions of this, ('anon.
The Department of Justice will, as it has in the past, assist the Committee in obtaining such additional Information as it may desire. In view of the

widespread public Interest in this type of Information, I believe it appropriate to make it generally available, and propose to do s-o.
Yours very truly,

DEAR MR. CHAIRIMAN: In anticipation of the forthcoming hearings on the nomination of Judge 11tarry A. Blackniun to the Supreme" Court, the April 15, 1970, letter from the Depuity Attorney General to the Committee indicated certain of Judge Blackinun's holdings with reference to cases before his court. The letter also indicated that the Deparlment of Justice stood ready to "assist the Committee In obtaining such additional information as it may desire."
Accordingly, we reslctfully request that you ask the i)epartmcnt to provide a coniIlee list of Judge Blackmun's holdings when lie took the bench and a chronological list of acquisitions and disposals of such assets thereafter to (late.
We also request a list of all eases before Judge lflacknmu Involving: 1. any corporation or other entity for which lie was then serving as an officer, director, or in a shnilar -apacity, and any corporation or other entity in which he held a financial Interest; 2. any corporation or other entity which Judge Blackmun had representel as an attorney or which was a client of his law firm ; or 3. any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, and any major supplier or customer of such corporations or other entitles enumerated inI the above requests. Ve appreciate that this Is not a simple task, but we-also assume that the Deputy Attorney General's letter iidlcates that research of this kiifi- has already been undertaken. Moreover. It is our Judgment that the avallabillty of such Infozination, in the above form, would enable the Conmmlittee to review fully and fairly all aspects of the nomination.

"Our Committee also feels that there would Ie no seeming impropriety or lack of good taste in your sitting in other cases, partlcularly after the lapse of
several years. Ytur former firm and its cents, just a.4 in the case of other
clients, are entitled to the benefit of your judgment oni the court on the cases
presented, unless there is disqualitfication or some consideration of the character indicated above which would cause you to decline to sit."
Because these informal lvecisions are not generally-available, I am attaching
a copy of the entire opinion. As you will note, In none of the six cases described
above was the party then represented by the )orsey firm a regular client of
the firim at the time that Judge Blackmun was a member. It' would seem
obvious in view of the lapse of time involved that the cases themhsles were not "in the firm" at the time lie was a imembher, even on vonie basis other than
regular representation. Therefore, in my opinion, Judge BIlackmun's sitting in these cases was entirely consistent with the language of Informal Decision 591,
quoted above. 6. Cases in Which Judge Btlackmun Sat Inroring a Client of ills Former
Firm Which Was Represented by Other Counsel in the Litigation Bef or
111m. Judge Blackmun has sat in the following five eases of this description: United States ex ret Glencral Elcctric Co. v. (lunnar I. Johnson and Son, Inc.,
310 F. 2d 899 (1962). General Electric, which became a client of the Dorsey firm subsequent to Judge Blackmun's departure, was in this ease represented
by counsel from St. Paul, Minnesota. Wcisscr v. Otter Tall Power Co., 31S F. 2d 375 (1963). Otter Tail Power Co.,
which was a client of the Dorsey firm, was represented in this action by J. Gerald Nilles of Fargo, North )akota.
Lxwts v. Super Vait Stores, Inc., 364 F. 2d 555 (1966). Super Valu, a client of the Dorsey firm, was in this litigation represented by J. Rudolph Ihansen of
Des Moines. C'argill, Inc. v. Zimner, 374 F. 2d 924 (19067). Cargill, Inc., a client of the
Dorsey firm, was in this action represented by Francis M. Smith of Sioux Falls,
South Dakota. Otter Tail Power Co. v. Federal Powcer Commission (subfilted to the Court of
Appeals for tle Eighth Circuit Ii October, 1969 but not yet decided). Otter Tail, a client of the Dorsey firm, was in this action represented by Cyrus A. Field of Fergus Falls, Minnesota.
Informal Decision 551, quoted above, addresses itvlf to those situations in which a judge should disqualify himself because his former firm Is counsel for one of the lrties in the case. Such disqlualification Is suggested where tie party represented by the former firm was a regular client of the firm at the tihe Ilhv Judge was a member. I do-not believe It b. any means follows froi this, however, that the Committee would advise disqualification in a case where one of the parties, though a client of the judge's former firm, is In that case represented
not by the former firm but by a wholly different tinn. Where the nexus between the judge and his former finn is lacking, I would think that disqualitlcation
would be required only where the connection between the client of the former firm and the judge is sufficiently close and personal as to be required either under the applicable language of the Canons 4., 13, and 26, or of 2Sq U.S.C. 155. In none of these five cases listed above, Judge Blackmun advises me, was there that sort of
a relationship, or anything remotely approaching it. 7. Case., in Which .Judge Blackinun Sat Involring "Any 'arent, Rubsidiary,
Affiliate, and Any Major Supplier or Customer of Suich Corporations or Other Fntitics Enumerated in the Above Request." Judge Blackmuni has advised the Department, and I have transmitted to the Committee by letter of April 15, advice with respect to his sitting in the Mlarney case at, a time that he owned 22 shares of stock in Ame.-ican Telephone and telegraph Conpany. This case was called tothe Conmmittee':s attention because of Judge lackuni's and the Department's belief that Northwestern Bell Telephone Company is a subsidiary of AmericaniTelephone and Telegraph Company. Judge Blackmtin's stockholdings Ini other corporations have "ncluded Ford Motor Company. IBM, J. C. Penney. ind Royal Dutch Petroleum, among others. Neither Judge Blackniun nor the I)epartment of Jutice knows who are the major suppliers or customers of these corpora-
tions, or of other corporations, listed above. Nor (to either know what subsidiaries or nMliates are associated with these corporations. While it may be possble to determine the question of affiliates and subsidiaries through an extensive examInatlon of a corporate work such as Moody's or Standard & Poor's. I should think that knowledge as to customers and suppliers could be obtained only by comprehensive inquiries addressed to the corporate executives themselves.

8. Cases in Which Judge Blackmun Has Either Disqualified Himsclj or Rcquescd tic Clerk of the Court Not to Allocate a Case to His Dirisooi. Judge Blackmun advises us that -it the following cases, he requested the Clerk to assign the case to a panel other thani his, or disqualified himself, for the reason Indicated:
Zirinsky v. Sheehan, 413 F. 2d 481 (1969). Former law clerk was on the brief. Rochester Ctric Theatre, lic. v. Ramsay, 368, F. 2d 748 (1966). Another former law clerk was on the brief and argued the case. In addition, the parties were a civic theater located in Rochester, Minnesota, and a former resident of Rochester. Bridgeman v. Gateway Ford Truck Sales (Docket No. 19,749), argued in January, 1970. As indicated in my letter of April 15, Judge Blackniun jisqualifled himself in this case because of his ownership of Ford Motor Company stock, after having learned that Gateway Ford Truck Sales was a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. I trust that this submission is of assistance to the Committee in its deliberation.
Yours very truly, ItICHARD 0. KLEUNDIENST,
Deputy Attorney General.

AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION,
Standing Comni Icc on Profcssional Ethics.
Ile Informal decision 594 October 22, 1902, judgo sitting in case where former fin is counsel:
With your letter of September 12 you advise that ever since you were elected Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Arkansas li 1048, It has been your
Ipractlce not to take part in cases wherein the law firm of which you were a former member appears as counsel; that even though not actually disqualified In such cases, you have felt that the losing lawyer or litigant might not think the Court was wholly unbiased, lpartleulairly tha case where the Court was divided and you might cast the deciding vote litfavor of your former pariner's client. You iicate-that you have been considering changing this practice and taking
part fitall cases, unless you are actually disqualified or have some special reason not to participate; but before doing so you would like to have the opinion of our committee as to whether any question of Judicial ethics is involved. The following Canons of .Judicial Ethics might appropriately be referred to:
No. 4 "A judge's official conduct should be free from impropriety nnd the appearance of Impropriety; he should avoid Infractions of law; and his personal behavior, not only upon the Bench and in the pierfornwance of judicial duties, but also in his every (lay life, should be beyond reproach."
No. 13 "A julge should not act in a controversy where a near relative Is a party ; he should not suffer his conduct to justify the Impression that any
person can Improperly influence hlin or unduly enjoy his favor, or that he Is affected by the kinship, rank, position or Influence of any party or
other person." No. 20 ". . . It is desirable that he should, so far as reasonably possible,
refrain from all relations which would normially tend to arouse the
suspicion t at such relations whrp or bias his judgment, or prevent his Impartial Zlittide df mind in the adin Istritlon of hlil ,id'al duties." In Formal Opiion 200 |his Connitteeheh pfiat a Judge should, 'hen feasible, avoid Sitting iWh6ut c6llcagues In a case In which a near relative Is counsel. in Informal Opniloi C-383, Involving (he same question, we sad, Iiwpart: "It would appear from the Judicial Canions quoted above and fronn the former opinion of this Comiimlttee that a Jud1ge Is not required to rescue himself mereiy because the firm employing his son was of counsel ila gi'ven case. Even %her the son is active In the case the Canons (10 iot preclude a judge from sitting It the case:
but good taste aid.he' 'desire to avoid any seeming lmpropriety dictate that the particular judge not actually participate in the decision litat case where the

son had actively participated in the decision in a case where the son had uively
participated In the case, either it the trial court or on appeal." We give you this background of the opinions of the Committee so that you
will know our approach to thse problems. There is no Canon 'of JuillcOl Ethics which would preclude a Judge from
sitting In a case merely becauseis former firm Is counsel in such case. However, the Committee feels that good'taste and a desire to avoid Any seeming Impropriety might cause a judge to decline to sit inL the following classes of cases where his former firi is counsel:
(a) Where the case was In the firm at the time he was a member; or (b) Where a' regular client of the firm at the time lie was a member is a
party to the case; or (c) Where a son or otlier near relative, employed by the firm, had actively
larticipated In the case, either in the trial 'court or on appeal. (One member of the Comiittee would onft Item (b) from our opinion, and expresses the view that there is no more reason for a judge to recuse himself fit such a situation than where a personal frefld Is Involved. Our Committee also feels that there would be no seeming Impropriety or lack of good taste In your sitting in other cases, particularly after the lapse of several years. Your former firm anid its clients, just as In the case of other clients, are entitled to the benefit of your judgment on the court on the cases presented, miless there Is disqualification or some consideration of the character indicated above which would cause you to decline to sit. In the final analysis it must be left to the good judgment and conscience of the Individual judge.

Cha Irman, Commnittceon the Judfolary, U.S. Senate, Washington, D..

DEAt SENATOR EASTLAND: The United States Court of Appeals for tile Eighth Circuit was in session at St. Louis on April 14 when the good news arrived that President Nixon had submitted tile nomination of Judge Harry A. BlackmuI as a Justice of the Supreme Court to the Senate for its advice and consent. A meeting was held of all of the active judges of 'the circuit, excluding Judge Blackmun. Each judge expressed the unqualifld opinion that Judge Blackmun is exceptionally well qualified to serve as a Justice of the Supreme Court.
Tile judges directed me to submit to you and your committee the consensus
of all of the judges that Judge Blackmun is in every respect eminently fitted to serve as a Supreme Court Justice. Our active Senior Judges Charles J. Vogel
and larvey N. Johnsen have advised me that they desire to Join fit this endorsement. If the committee should so desire, each judge is most willing to personally express his views to the committee. it was tie thought that this joint expression would avoid' the reading of many letters in which the Information would be substantially duplicated.
I have received direct word without solicitation from many of the district
judges In our circuit that they enthusiastically support JUSdgo blackmun's nomination. To my knowledge, there Is no judge in this circuit who has any
contrary view.
Some of us have served with Judge Bleckmun during the entire period that he has servd upon the Court of Appeals. This ais given us an exceptional op-

portunity to evaluate his qualifications, lie has given full and fair consideration to all Issues raised by the parties. Judge Backrnun s a man of great ablity. The scholastic record he has made in lpursult of his--edutcat6h, including his work at Harvard, establishes his exceptional mental 'qualifications and ihe fact that he has received the full benefit of Is schooling, lie has been familiar with the operation of the federal courts since shortly after graduation he served as law clerk for the late John _S.anborn, one of the greatest Jurists that has served upoh the Eighthf'Cir CIt." rIkiv frequently heard Judge Sanl orn express plalise for Judge Blackmun's Judicial qualifications and I know, that he enthuitmstically supported Judge BlackmUn's appointment to the Couti of Appeals. Ilts legal teaching experience at the St. PaUl and University of Minnesota law schools, his practice of law as t member of i prominent law firm, his services as resident counsel to the Mayo Cllhi from 150 to 1959 and his

28
senices upon many boards ernnected with the Clinic, all serve as an excellent background to a Judicial career.
Judge Blackmun Is a man of excellent. character and possesses unquestioned intergrity. lie arrives at his own decisions upon the basis of tile facts and applicable law In each case. While lie will give careful consideration to the views expressed by counsel and the views expressed by his colleagues on the bench, he makes his own decision,. On the cases assigned to him for option, his many reported opinions reflect that his decisions are based upon sound legal reasoning and upon established precedents.
Many members of the Bar have appeared before panels of our court upon which Judge Blacknuin fins been a member. It Is our view that the members of the Bar who are familiar with Judge Blackmun's opinions consider him to be an able and outstanding judge.
If there is any further Information which your committee might desire, any member of our court upon request would be happy to furnish you with such Information to the best. of his ability.
IImsummary, without hesitation the active and senior members of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit enthusiastically and without qualifMcation support the nomination of Judge Blackimun for the position of Justice of the Supreme Court. It Is our hope that your committee will give full consideration to Judge Blackmun's ability and background and will vote to confirm his appointment.
Respectfully yours,
MARTIN 1). VAN OOSTERIIOUT.

DEA-t MR. CHAIRMAN: I note from the press that Judge Ilarry Blackmuf of the Eighth Circuit has been nominated for Associate Justice of the Suprene Court and that you will soon be having hearings concerning'the same. Having known Judge Blackmun for several years and being a former Circuit Justice to time Eighth Circuit, I felt that I should advise you as to my views concerning Judge
Blackmun. I have known Judge Blackmun ever since he came to the Eighth Circuit In 1959.
Ile is a very dedicated and able Judge as is Indicated by his opinions. Ills personal conduct is of the highest order and his integrity without question. Sotne three yedrs ago he was appointed Chairman of the Research Committee of the Federal Judicial Center, of which I was Director. lie worked closely with" tie Center and rendered it great service not only hithe area of research, but in other activities as well. Ills committee met three or four times at my office and I worked with them very closely. I found Judge Blackmun to be a very personable aITd effective chalrrmahof a distinguished committee composed of such men as:rJudge Carl McGowan; Judge htubert L. Will; Dr. George Graham (Director, National Academy of Public Administration) ; Dr. Stanley F. Yolles (Director, National Institute of Mental Iealth) ; Dean Phil Neal (University of Chleago Law School) and Professor MIAfrice Rosenberg (Columbia University Law SchoOl).
It is a pleasure for me to give him my uiquallfled endorsement and I'trust that the Committee will find it possible to report his iaii6e out favorably iII ti near future so that the Court may have a full complement of its membership.
Withlhgh regard and best wishes, I am

Ohafrman, Committec on Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
DEAR SENATOR EASTLA'D: I have known Judge Harry A. Blackmun since his appointment to the Court of Appeals of the eighth Circult. In view of recent events I feel constrained to write on his behalf. I have met himat various circuit

conferences and as a district judge have sat with him oin several cases in the Court of Appeals. I am presently serving with liln on the Interim Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct.
We have visited together many times and I have found that we have mutual friends, particularly in Rochester. I have learned from such persons his excellent reputation in his home community. lie is a pleasant compAnion and understanding in his approach to all problems. As a judge lie Is conscientious and scholarly, yet posksessed of what is frequently called good common sense. Ills standards of excellence Mid high scholarship will be a credit to any court.
I observe from the press that a digest of his opinions has been furnished to you and to your Committee. Although I analyzed certain of his opinions when first interviewed by the FBI prior to his nomination, at the request of the interviewing agent, I will not prolong tis letter by repetition, An examination of his opinions will reveal is ability to read Intelligently, to think coherently, to write clearly, and will disclose his capacity for thorough research andi for critical thought and will show his faculty for dispassionate Judgment. These qualities in an honest and industrious lawyer canl produce nothing other than a sound Judge. I can truly state that within my acquaintance there Is no other judge whom I could recommend so unreservedly for the position of Justice of the United States Supreme Court a. Judge Blackmun.

Senator JAME8 0. EASTLAND,

U.S. CouR or APPnAL, EOHTT CIRCUIT,
Soica City, Iowa, April 28, 1970.

Ch airman, Comm i tco on thc Judiciary, U.. Senate, Washington, D.C.
l)FAR SENATOR E0ASTLAND: It has come to my attention that some question has been raised with respect to the propriety of Judge, Blackniun sitting on a few cases while on the Court of Appeals in which he held a very minor stock interest in one of the corporate parties. Judge Blackmun has disclosed such participation to the Justice )epartment and this Information has in turn been give to your
committee. During the fifteen years that I have served on the Court of Appeals many of
the judges who served on tie court during such period as a part of their Investment portfolio, like many private indivldluals an1(d public officials, have Included some blue chip common stock hopefully as a hedge against inflation. In most situations, such holdings have been one hundred shares or less. I personally own some stocks. WhtIn'tlho matter of sitting on a case in which a judge owns a trivial stock Interest arose, I took up the problem with Chief Judge (lardier, who also owned a number of stocks. It was his firm view that It was inconceivable that a minor stock Interest should disqualify a judge. The same view was taken hy Harvey Johnsen during his term as chief judge of our court aud so far as I know prior to recent d-elopments in connection with the Ilaynsvworth noml-
nation, no Judge dissented front that view. To the best of my knowledge, any Judge holding t minor stock interest in one
of the litigants made such Interest known to the chief Judge and his colleagues
on the panel. I know of no Instance where a Judge's views were warped or biased
by a n6thinal stock interest. The cases on which Judge Blackth mi sat iII which he had a small stock interest.
to the best of my knowledge, are Hanson v. Ford Motor Co., 278 P.2d 586 (1960) ; Ktila v. Ford Motor Co., 338 P.2d*732 (1904) ; and Mahoney v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 377 F.2d 549 (1967). Judge Blackmun disclosed his stock Interest to the chief judge and to the panel with whoin he sat and all were of
the view that he was not disqualified to sit. Ills Interest in Ford I believe was fifty shares of stock and his Interest in American Telephone & Telegraph was somewhat smaller. The two Ford cases did not Involve any large amounts and
the decision adverse to Ford would not have affected the market falue of Ford stock at all and would have decreased the book value of Judge l1lackmun's Ilterest in the stock only a fraction of a dollar. Certaihly no one qualified to serve as a judge would have'been prejudiced-or biased in sith a situation.
It Is also noteworthy that Judge Blackniun wrote the opinion Il the Hanson case upsetting a Judgment n.o., made in favor of Ford and'r~hitating tile jury verdict. In Kotula, Judge Maithes wrote the opinion in which Judge lBlacknun
and Judge Ridge concurred. On the basis of the sound reasoning set forth in the opinion, the Judgment in favor of Ford was uphehl. In Mahoney, the three Judges who heard the case unanimously uphehl the district Judge's determnina-
tion that Northwestern Bell's principal place of business is Nebraska a1d 'since the plaintiff was also a resident of Nebraska, It was held tmiit diversity jurlsdivtion did not exist. This Of course did not prevent time plaintiff from asserlng
his rights In the state court if he so chose. I felt that It was may duty to write this letter In fairness to Judge Ilackmun
as he was only conforming to the policy of the court In sitting in tie cases above
discussed. I realize that a serious difference of opinion How exists whether a Judge should sit in any case in which fihe has a stock Interest, however trivial is interest may be. Since this controversy has developed, our Judges have been
uniformly disqualifying themselves from sitting in any case In which they hold stock ownership in one of tile litigants and Judge flacknmnn has followed this
policy. I ant certain that no Judge has any desire to sit In any case iii which"he holds
stock In one of the litigants and a judge by disqualifying hhiself places a burden upon the other judges requiring"them to take over some work allotted to Iihn.
In a court such as ours where the judges do not resihe at the seatof the court, It is often Inconvenlent to call in another judge to sit on a particular case. If it is necessary that-this be dohe, of course it can be done and Is being done on an Interim basis until the standards In this respect are set down by the appropriate committee of tie American Bar Association who has this problem under consideration In connection with its revision of the rules of judicial ethics.
Very truly yours,

.1finncapolis, Minn., April 29, 1970. lion. JAMES 0. EASTLAND, Chairman, Scnate Judiclary-Commiitce, 1,.8. Senate, Washington, D.C.
I)EAR SFNATOR EASTLAND: At tits time when you and your Committee are clsidering the confirmiltion of the President's appointment of Judge Harry A. Blackmun to the Supreme Court of the United States, I would like to express my support of this confirmation.
.Judlge Harry Blackiun is, in my mind ,the finest appellate Judge in America. Ils scholastic credentials are Impeccable. The late Judge John Sanborn, of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, at the age of SO and after approximately forty years as a federal Judge, talked to me concerning Judge Blackinun who had once been his law clerk. Judge Sanborn said., "Ilarry l. he best legal scholar I have ever known. Every opinion or memorandum is a treatise Ih|Itself. lie is deliberate, courageous and moderate, lie is the single person who, I believe, would be the Ideal appellate judge." In the years since that statement was made, I have often reflected upon those words. Of my own knowledge, I believe they were lrophetie and have been proven to be true.
I wholeheartedly express my support of the appointment of Judge Blackmon to the Supreme Court of the United States.
Sincerely yours, MILES IV. LoRD.
The CIRtAx,\.'.Judge Blackmun, will you stand up?
1)o you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole trit1h, :ifd nothing but'the tratll, SO 10lp you God?
Judge BJAACKMUN.. 1 (10.

CIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED

The C1A1 .IRAN. I wish you would state for the record what. your outJsuiddeg6inBcIoJAmCeKMhausN.beTefnillssitnackeesymouue hbaavcke, b,Meern.Cohniatihremabjeln, ctoh.1959, downi
through 1970. My prilnary, source of income has been the salary pid to mie as a judge of the U.:S. Court, of Appeals for the Eighth dircuit.
In addition there has been approximately $1,500 a yearreceived from interest and dividends on such securities which i owned as an investment.. There have been executive's fees in two estates. There have been soRUe capital gatlls 0el secuirities disposed of and through 1903 there was $1,500 a year, thlt. is, for-of course, for 1959, most of which was before I went on the beich-1959, 1960, 1961,1062, 1963,the sun of $1,500Aiiufftilly as a fee as director of the Kahler Corp.
The Cn.%iRrM,%x. Now, that is really an aflhliAte of the hospital, is it, not?
Judge ,BLACtKU,. Thq Kahler Corp. was originally organized through tha insistence and leadership of I)r. William ,J.: Mayo, who was oiue of the two famous brothers. I do not know whether the members of the cominittee know Rochester, Min., but it is a sn-il crossimads town or was in those days. It ifilthe southeastern mt1 of the State. This was at the time when the Mtyo name had become magic. Patilnlts were c6lfing there from &ilover. There was no place to stay except boarfding houses. Dr. i"ll,4 as lie did in so mnaly other ways, felt. that one way to protect-the patients was to create for them acceptable, clean hotel accommodations.

ie brought Arthur Roberts to town-this is long before my timeand then John 1I. Kahler. Ihe Mayo organizations invested a substantial amount in the organization of the Kahler Corporiation and that investment has been heli to this (lay, increased somewlmt by bequests to the Mayo Association,now Mayo Founldation.
Over the years, certainly in'my time and for a decade before, there were three or four members from the business end of the Mayo organizations who served as l)irectors of the Kahler Corp. This was part of our business assignments and in due course after I was brought to Rochester, I was asked to take one of those directorates, and held it until the fall of 1963.
The Mayos (1o not own the controlling interest in Kahler. They own approximately 10 to 1 percent, but that interest with the Rahler family interests together create a practical controlling interest, in the Icaler Corp. proItm, wptaesdlamrgeeltyo agsoaosnerovircigeitnoaltlhye aMnadyosuogrggeasnteizdattihoants Ithsatta,yofoncouunrstei,l

increased, as I recall, to 100 shares bv stock splits. The?C0AIRMANx. How many million shares are outstanding, (1 you
reall Judge ]hACK-sUx. I (to not personally recall, Mr. Chairmann but
it is set forth, I think, in the Deputy's letter. it, is some 15 niillilin originaly and has been increased to a much larger figure.
'I he CtAimmx. Now what tlier stock do you own? Judge l3AcKxCrux. I believe that. the commiihittee has in its files a list which I personally prepared of the investment portfolio, small lioigh it was which I possessed when I took my oath on November 4, 1959. Specially, at that time, Atlantic Coast Line, Chemical Baiti New York Trust, thenlthe Ford shares, 100 shares of Kahler, some stock in Morgan-Guaranty 'Trust Co., Panhandle Eastern, U.S. Treasury
C.I.'s, a small amioit, p)lUs a savings account. Since then, as other information submitted to the committee which
I I)rplai(l discloses, such purchases and sales that have been made during my period onithe bench and thelh finally, my current. investment list which, just, to name the securities, shares of American Security

in summary, what. I have given to lie Committee is a true and correct statement.
Tho CIL,MiMN. It will be printed in the record. Now, I am requested by a member of the Senate to ask you two
questions.
Judge Blackmun, (1o you believe that. the only proper functi6n of a Justice of the Supreme Court is to interpret the Constitution and laws of the UMted States?
Judge Bi,,%cK3-3tv, Of course, the answer to that question, Mr. C illilailn iost.definitely be in the affirmat ive.
The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

If you (o so believe, to what, extent if at all, do you think it proper for a Justice of the Supreme Court, in interpretig the Constitfition afid laws of the United States to take into account. his own personal idea of what. constitutes enlightened social, economic or political policy ?
Julge BI.ACKMU.N. Of coarse, this is a changing world. It has been this way since the fotinding of our Nation. I personally feel that the Constitution is a document of specified words and construction. I would (1o my best. not.to have my decision ailected by my personal ideas and piiloso)hy, but would attempt to constrie that, instrument, in'the light, of what I feel is its definitee innd determined meaning. Of course,
maTnlryletiCitieiR-i .%ttAhMis-Nis. oSbsecnuarteo. r McClellan.
Senator McCEm.T.%-x. Mr. Chairman, I (to not think I have any questions at. this time. I pretty well satisfied my,?self through chantlies avail-
able to me regarding the nominee's qualfik( tioiis, his general philos-
01)hy of the law and our system of purisprudence, and also as to his judicial tempeahient. I halve exaiined the material that, has been submitted through the De)artment of Justice with respect to his persoial htfairs or financial af airs and I havealso taken into account. that lie comes highly recommended from most creditable and authoritative
sources.
I have learned nothing of substance that, illitates against, his character or against his qualifications. I therefore so far as I know nowunless there should be some unforeseen devefpnlents of which I am not. aware and (1o not. anticipate-I am prepared to sul)port the conformation.
I want to congratulate You, Judge, upon receiving this greatdistihction and recognition nid I trust, that you will be cofiflimed promiptly and assume your duties at an early date and that. you will have a very successful and rewarding career as a member of the highest, court of our land.
Judge BicKxmux. Think you. That. mains i great deal coiling from the Senator from a State i the Eighth Circuit.
The C,AIRIMAN. Senator Eriin. Senator ERvix. Judge, Chief Justice Marshall stated in substance in his famous opinion in Gibbons versus Ogden that the patriots who framed the Constitutioh and the )eol)le who rht'Ified it must be understood to have intendedd what. they have said. I would be glad to have your comments on that. statement. of Chief Justice Marshall. Judge BLACKMUN. Senator Ervin, I think that. is a very definite, easily understood stateiient. It is one which for me is tli starting
point. of constittional interpretation and construction. Mr. Chief Justice Ma-shll's statements, of course, almost, deserve an attitude of sanctity. But I certainly would assume that the Constitution means what,it,says.
Senator Envi,. I will ask you if you agie with me that the-reason the Constitution has been able to endure so well arises out, of the fact
that-the grants of the power which the Constitution makes extends int 6the future?
Judge BILAC.KMXu. This is the way it has to be, Senator, anit this is what occasions now and then amendments to the Constitiition to meet new needs that, were not, foreseen years ago.

Senator Envix. Chief "Justice Marshall also stated in subs:tnce in probably his greatest. opihion, Marbury versus Madison, after poilt big out, that the Constitution reqitires each Sipreie Court. Justice to take an oath to sfpp6rt it, that.'this oath iliposes upon the Supreme Court. Justice the obligation to accept the Constititibn as a rule for the governing of his official actions. I would like to have your comments on that statement.
Judge BLACkMxN. Of course, Senator Ervin, 10, going on'tt years ago, I took that rather awesome oath. It, was administered to me by Judge John B. Sanboan, a man whom I revere in-memory. I know7 what. he thought of liat. oath and I hope that I have been able to fulfill ilsobligations in inuch'the same measure as he did.
I wild regard any new oath which were to come ny way as one deserving the same seriousness of attention and obligation as before. So, mly answer to you is defliitcly in' the affirmative.
Senator EViNx. I would like to make this observation. So far as I have ibn -ble to do so, in the limited fime at my disposal, I have tried to familiarize myself with your actions as 'a member of tile U.S. Court of Appeals and I have reachedithe conclusion thatt you are able and willing to exercise what the Chief Justices of the States described iin their resolution in Pasadena, Calif., in 1958 as the highest judicial attribute; that is, the judicihi attriblite of self-restraiht. On the basis of your past personal and judicial conduct I expect to vote for yl,6ir coniinait ion.

The CmiA-nR1Ax. Senator Hart. SenatorJhwr. Mr. Chairman, I think in fairness I should addtess to Judge Blacknitnm a question that I directed' to ailier no' ihiees. The President indicatedl first. when he accepted his party's n6iimia'tion, and then later in a press conference, some of tle elements that hle would seek in those he would nominate to the Supreme Court. Puttinkgthem in capsule, one is a man with a mark of excellence. And the second, a strict constructionist. And then in his Miami acceptiiiice speech, a man devoted to the great principles of civil rights. With respect t6the first, when I addressed that question to aniearlier nominee I acknowledged that, lie could niot express atn opinion about his distinetlon or excellence. But, all the informati6onii"t has been made available to tiwsould suggest that, indeed you do possess in fill measure the excellence which I think, whether we always required it before, now and lreafter we should require of a nominee to the Supreme Court., that the selecion of a nominee should be made from among those on the list of the best. DiSincti16'n ea be earned hi'iiIiiy ways, not. necessarily as a sitting Federal judge, but, by every shindard, beginihig with'suina cume laude gradu tion, you do have many marks of excellence. What do you thiffi'ilheIPresident. means when lie says he is looking for astri't coiistfuctioiist.i I did address tlat questionJudge BJcm~1u. Senator hait., I silipose-I doinofmean to sound faceti6i-I stippose the President would be the best. man to answer that. I think, in -my own view, that perhaps the answer'lies in the questions which the Chairman itad Senator McClellan and Senator Ervin

have asked me and tile answers I have tried to give to those general questions.
In a moment of great weakness when the press caught me in St. Louis
some short time ago, tile same question was asked and my answer was that. some of these things, of course, are labels.
All I can say is when one has been olthe Federal benth for a decade, his record is th re. It is in the open. This isthe discip line of appellate judicial work, of course. Every decision is by writing hnd there for tile public to see.
Now, how some would iiterpret that as a strict constructionist or as a loose one I do not know. I can say no more thit tat.
Senator HAr. On that point, yotu exchanged observations with Senator McClellan-no,' )erhal)s it was to tile questioii that the Chaitfat hsoamd ebtheeinng aosnkepdaptoeradanddre"stshe'to myeoaun-t,thwahtat.ththeeyFosuanidd,inagndFyaotuheargsrepeudt that y obliIgration was to ideilifvand interpret what the founders said. You coel lided your answer by'saying' that sometimes it is obscure as tO their meaning.
Judge BLACKMUN. Of course, times are different in f9701h'liki they wiere 200 yers-'ago. No I~ob of iHien 200 years ago could deterMdhe what ouri)loblems are today. That is, I sUl')pose, what we have courts for, Federal courts for, to c€oni'tue the Constitufiimffin 'the light of current l)roblems. But I think as a beghiin1ng point tite Founding IiPthers must have intended what. they said.
Senator IltAr. But that document frequently, I suppose, occasionally certainly, does not specifically address itself 'to tile concrete quetion that is brought, before the court. Do you agree that" tie work of a member of the Snprenie Court: by its very nature requires sofih6 inter-
pretation beyond the words o the Constittu{ioniihd tfiminlterpretation requires an understindIjig of the contemporary society which gives rise to1the concrete problem that is presented?
JIdge BL.ACK UN. Of course, Lthiink this is saying the same thing
perhaps in better language than I was able to produce. Phis again is why we have courts. Conditions are different today ihan they were even 10 years ago. I see this in cases that. come to us. Thisis one reason the Constitution has endured, that it is in a way a rigid instrument and ina way a very flexible one. We search for its meaning. Sometimes it,is easy, somet imes it is very, %'erdiicuilt.
Senator IHnr. Judge two mnwhom I respect. highly, both judges one a former Chief of Justice of the Michion Supreme Court, S, -i1 a jift906 of that, court, John Dethmers, and a member of the xth

Iastly, Mr. Chairman, I thiif that we should acknowledge the American lar Association's more fMll and complete report. on the nominat ion. You ut iti,n the record. It describes a survey the Judicial Selection Committee made in fill detail. They have iqfmired of le deans of all of the law schools in theet~lih cirit, they hite iiqtired of a number of law fachiily inembers opgidtde the "eighfli1 circuit. his is al to the good. I n6t6 a'so thatthey ididte in a sense that it, is an interim report. and that the investigation is cohitiimiig amid that they would like the privilege of subi nt'ng a farther report

after the conclusion of the Juliciary Committee hearing. But based on tibmuch fuller inquiry so far, as'they spell it out, than they made in earlier nominations, they eidol-Se the "noniliation.
I would anticipate that I would vote to report favorably the nomifuation.
The CA'111MrAx. Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. I want to extend a word of welcome to Y61, Judge Blacknun, as extended by my colleagues here this morning. I believe that.your nomination vindicates what, the Senate did on the prior two nominations. In those two instances the imp61-tant. thing was not so much that we rejected a particular nitin, but thfat. we reestablished a very high stand ard of excellence in terms of Supreme Court nominations, and certainly it wild appear to me that you meet this
standard of quality, and I am pleased to welcome you.
Last evening I "had an opportiiity to participate in a ceremony which honored the distinguished Chief 'Justice, retired, of the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Wairen, in which lie received, for his service on the Supreme Court, what is called the Profile in Coihi'ge Award given by B'nai B'rith here in Washington. And though iknow the chief purpose and function of today's hearings is to hear from you, l ddeidfinmiankgewshoamt eIotbhsinerkvawtiaosnsJulsatsitceniW'huatrraetn''tsliavetrcyeruemnioqnuye, cionnttibermmitsioonf
to tile court. and to our society in the monumental decisions he partill)ated in as the Chief Justice which reestablished our sense of freedoms and our sense of liberty, and I spoke of my fears about. the present period in national life, and I would like just to"repeat a very brief part of that statement of what I said and then to get, your reaction to it, in a general way insofar as you feel comfortable in commenting or as
specific as yb feel that you cold CommMilt. And so with your inldulgence I will just read a rather brief part of
this speech:
I fear that we are entering another era of crisis, an era of inaction and retro. gression ani repression easily matching that which faced Chief Justice Warren when he arrived in Washington, an era which will demand frequent profiles in
courage if we are to survive as a free people. Many of the signs are small, but they are ominous. Iaken separately, some may not seem unbearable or worth
fighting about. But taken together they suggest a trend and a pattern which could lead to an ever faster circle of repression and reaction with no conceivable end. They are gnawIng at the precious foundations of our freedom, chipping away piece by piece the barriers against tyranny and oppresson which the framers of the Constitution erected.
E'en to recite calmly a list of the syml)toms is to give the Impression that 1984 may be less than 14 years away, and that "Z" could happen here:
More wiretapping in more kinds of cases, and assertion of the absolute power
to bug dissenters without court orders. Pressures for no-knock searches and for detention without bail. The use of scare tactics to discourage attendance at protest gatherings, and
the obsessive focus on the few lawbreakers itnpeaceful crowds of ten of thousand&
Growing use of domestic spys-In schools, in political groups, at public nieetings, of informants who sometimes hell) to foment the very acts they are sup-
posed to be Investigating. Verbal harassment of dissenters by political leaders, not on the merits of the
issues Involved, but through guilt by aslsoclation and exaggerated codewords. The new applicattoi form for Washington denmionstration permits with blanks
for everything' from phltosophy to arrest records.
A new attempt to prevent disagreeable protests near the White hous altogether.

The Installation In the White House of a Journalist with carte blanche to fish through Federal tax files and other cofldential materials.
Executive resistance to a bill to lihninate an anachronistic and frightening
Provision for Federal detention camps, reslstance which melted only when it became publically embarrassjing.
Serious consideration being given to a proposal to remove five and six year old children from their homes Into correctional camps on the basis of tests of their
potential for later criminality. $harl) curtailment of the availability of Federal parole, the best incentive
known to give i)rlsoners hope and a goal as they are rehalilltated. Refuaml to suppr oxtenson of the Voting Rights Act of 19W,5, the most sue-
cessful contribution to universal suffrage since the 19th Aniendnent. Federal encouragement of continued resistance to Constitutionally required
!-chool desegregation. Past court nomainmees chosen for their willingness to resist ('onstitiional man-
date, rather than for eminence or leadership. Official solihitatlin of letters if (ndorsemeht of a court nominee from Federal
employees and judges, but investigating and threatening of government fundedl lawy ers who write let terms opposing the nominee.
Inspection of incoming foreign mail by Federal authorities. A concerted effort to interfere with the freedom of the press, led by the number 2 man in the Administration. llamssing calls to the networks by tle Chairman of (lie Federal ('ommulieations Commission, and to local media by it member of the Subversive Activitle.4 Control Board and by our Nation's first Information czar. I[arassment of the national educational TV network loythe Internal Revenue
Service. A constant effort to l)lame the Nation's ills on scalgoats such as the previous
Attorney General. It is a shocking and terrifying list, I believe. It betrays a total lack of respect
for our heritage of freedom and constitutes an mediate threat to our system.
The most disturbing element is lprhaps the rhetorIc which accompanies these Vmtoms. of inipent Constitutional retrograde. Tile Innuendoes are those of the fifties, The inlileation is that anyone who believes In the principles of the Bill of Rights or lhe lIlth Amendment Is somehow unpatriotic, that the 20th Century cannot afford the luxulry of liberty, that we should go on a diet that dispenses with fliefrosting of freedom on America's cake.
I believe, Mr. Nominee, that this is fle kind of atmosphere we are entering and the challenge which will be posed to the Supreme Court during the itinlediate futule. So, what I would be interested in is in your views of the Supreme Court as the l)rOtector of our basic liberties and our basic freedoms in the face of this challenge.
Judge lI,.ACKMI'X. Senator Kennedy, that, of course, is a most iml)ressive-list that you have colupiledso ver. well.

that my record and the opinions that I have written and which are spread upon the law books will show, paffiillail in the civil 1iights area and in the labor area and in the treatment. of little people, what I hope is a sensitivity to their problems. I tlhik I am fully aware of most, of the matters you nientioned. I am conicerlned about, mny of them. I am not concer-ned that. the issues exist, concerned in the sense

fore Us.

I think the fact that the issues are there menins we are on the way

to resolving many of them. It is my earn.,t hope and prayer that,

this is so.

If I may make one comment., somiewhere in that list, I think was

something'about, the solicitation of letters from' Federal employees.

I must. give you assurance that I have not indulged in that"" iactice

during the present emergency in my life, and I hope you will accept.

I can say and plea(l in answer to yvour questiolmi isthat insofar as these

One of the thiig's that I have been interested in, and I have asked past. nominees aboit, is their view about some of the chief chall6nges which are facing our society today, because I think, as-all of uutknow, there are completely discrtionary matters which come before tile court, for example, in extending certiorari to partictilar cases, or sitting on emergency petitions as circuit justice where actions ofthe
Supreme Court Jstilces are almost totally discretionary and they must bring foth all of their own experience, sensitivitie's and sense of priorities. So I would be if-treste6d, to thle extent, that you feel comfortable, in hearing from you on some of the challenges which are

I am sorry to answerr you on a personal plane but: perhaps your
question was so directed. Senator Krxxr~ny. Certainly, I think your response in terms of the
alienation of the youth has been extremely helpfful.

And I thinkii'pehi ps my best answer is to rely again on the record of my decisions ifibthese problems.
In fairness to myself Ithink I have never avoided takingg on the
propa rationi of an opinion in a case which is sensitive. Sonietifnes this is don on the Federal bench. It, is not. done in our cireit.' ' lave not
done it. Senator KNFDrY. If I could move into a different, area, this itu
poiit, that lies been raised in the press and Tthink yo,0u probably want to respond to it. There has been a great deal of (iscusion abotit, your reationship wlth tho6 Chief ,Justice. Could you tell us a Ii1f1At about tlik 'to lhe e&tentt you tlhk it would be. iisful and hellfil?
I think what. I l' getting ht is, will but feel coin pletely comfortable in 'disagreeing with tie Chief Justice ? I know you have been longtime

friends and have had a good deal of mutual respect for each 6ther, but could you for the sake of this record perhaps describe ill some way the nature of that r1lationship and how you would view that relat ionship Were you to beapproveA ?
Judge BLACRMRTN. Yes. I think your question,'Senator Kennedy, of course, is an aPprwaite and fair one. I have known the Chief justice all of my life that I can recollect. I thfik our paths crossed first, when our respective mothers packed us off to Sunday school at age
4 or 5. As has been reported in the press, we went through grade school
together and there our school paths Fe rated. le and I went to different high schools. In those (lays in St. Paul one could select the
school to whih lie desired to go. I was the licky recipient of a scholarship to your alma mater and
took advantage of it. I question my Nvisdom in retrospect in some respects because I did not have anything else to go with it.
Ife did not go East. I went East. I was there all year, I 'did not get home at Christmas, and our association necessarily was one of very limited relationship during much of those years, seven in number.
Our association really was that of childhood and adolescence. Out-
professiolial lives have been separated. lIe practiced in the city of St. Paul and I practiced in the city of Mihineapolis. I SUil)O.C to those who are not familiar witi the '1 vin Cities this does not seem like much of a distinction but there is generally a barrier between the two so far
as the )Iact.ice of law is concerned. Ramsey Comty, St. Paul, lawyers
on occasion appear i inneapolis and the other way around, hut not too frequent l.
Never have we associated in a case. Nevel have we been opposed in a case, Ile has served on the Iboaid of the Wllim Mitchell College of Law, the old St. lauil College of law, as I have, but until the last year we have never -erved together as I recall.
iThe Chief Justice-well, I left Miieapolis in 1950. That is almost 20 years ago. lie came to Washington in 1953, more th-il 17 y6eas
ago. Phat is a separation of 1,500 miles. I have been in Washiligton many times %%h-en I have not seen him or talked with him. lie has
been in Min nesota many times when he. has not seen or talked with me. You are aware, I think, of the fact. that he. did ie thedhonor of ask-
ing tie to staid up at his si(le when he was married to Mrs. 1lerter, the then Elvara Stromberg, a very small wedding in her home. She had ole atten(amt and I was his onlv attendant.
I regard hmi as a goe(l frieid. As we grew u ) together I thing we indulged more in arguments than we did ili agreement. This was good forI would have no hecsitation whatsoever, and lieI is tile fist lperolnimto beo aware of this, inl disagreeing with him, or, if f may speak for him,

SentorI(ENED. Avery good answer. Has there ever ))Cel a point where yolu thought your relationship with the Mayo Clinic might raise a question as to w:helher you could properly sit "inthe doctor versus patient or hospital versus'doctor or hospital versus patient cases? Judge IILACKNATM'N. If I ever felt that way, Senator Kenniedy, I would immediately disualify. We, of course, have had some malpractice cases. We have had sonic cigarette cases and the like. I find myself confronted with, the fact tfant my colleagues say, I am glad you are sitting on this kind of a case because you know medt-l pr'oblems better than I do. I think most of those cases-I have not listed this area-have been resolved in favor of the complaining patient.
rather than the defending doctor, whoever it might have been.
I Would, of course, never sit on a case involving the Mayo Clinicever. I think my answer is that my experience there has fortified me, made ic somewhat better educated and more knowledgeable in medical fields than I otherwise would be.
I might. may in Rochester to the little children everybody is a doetor, wheler )ieis a lawyer or cutting the grass. lie is still doctor to

I would answer that. Senator K.NE.OFY. The suggestion was made on Monday by a Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives that when a judge iithdraws from a later case involving a party with whom he has had some relay.
tionship, that is proof that lie erred in not withdrawing from 1In earlier case involving tie same party. Would you agree with that?
Would you conclude from your own experience that. evolving standards cani altei' i judge's (lecislon in this regard?
.Judge BJACK.MUX. rluhis may well have reference to one case in which I was involved. I would'hope tlat. that is not indicative of any feelings of failure or guilt on my part. I think, Senator Kennedy,
the times have changed. Senator K-: DY. That suggestion by a Member of the ifouse of
Representatives was in no way directed toward you. .JUdge BLACK.MUN. I think the times have changed a great (teal in
the )ast 5 years and I would not say for the worse by any means. I know today, in View of events over the past 5 years, that I am much more careful about disqualifying.
On the other hand, I venture to say this. Our court operates differently than (toes the U.S. Court of Appeals here in Washington,
in Chicago, or the one in New York, where the judges are all present. We live in the field. Our calendars are fixed a month in advance. One cannot always tell from those calendars just who the parties are and when we get. to St. Louis and review the records and briefs prior to argument, and disqualify, it is always a disruptive move because then
we must get in at district judge or ti'ansfer cases between divisions. l3erhaps our tendency has been too mich the other way and not
disqualifying in our cotrt. But. I have nothing, in my own view, to apologize, for, in what has been done.
On the other hand, I am perhaps the last one with an objective judgment on what I have done.

Senator KENNxEDY. Mr. Nominee, ilrlesponse to all ,irlier -question

Senator 1(ENNEDY. I would' ike just to rea(1 two quotations from a

speech you gave al(d see if there is anythingihat you would like to

elaborato on. This is included in Federal Rules )eisioins, volume 34

at page 343. This is a very short paragraph'In which you say:

Judicial attitudes change. court personnel changes. We progress, we hopp,-In legal and even In constitutional luterpretation. As in medicine, with which I nia somewhat familiar, so with law, although more slowly, there Is constant movement. We should be aware of this, antiIpak it, not resent it. We would-iot wish the situation to be otherwise.

lDoes tilat represent. fairly your view in terms of the role you will

am.?dge B CK N.I think so, Senator. That. lia-P)er was givenl at our1 circulit con ferenlce a few years ago. It was Onl a subject. thlat. I felt myself not very well qualifiedl to give. Th'le program committee asked mei to give it, becautse the district judges were conf used, wvere varypig inl their results, particularly in postconviction matters, habeas corpus,
2255's and the like, and ihe assignment. compelled me. to get. into this area.
I am not at. all certain iti,s a very good lial)er, although it has been cited a number of times. What I "was trying toget acro-ss was that the law does develop, l)articularly ill p-'ocedural matters, and that, what, wvas true in 1950 i)roce(lurally is not necessarily true as of tile (late of that l)al)er, whenever it was, l)articIlarly in ilie light of currently decided Supreme coult cases, and that, (lie strictc. judge who is on'the firing line in these matters must be awarv of them and accept what tile Supreilme Court says as, illeffect, our guiding precedent.
Senator IKvNl:m,x . Later on in that same speech you said:
Our professional satisfaction lies in a Job performed responsibly and not avoiding reslmnsiillity.

,tJdge LAr,..i NtuW x. ell, you embarrl§ me somewhat, Senator Kenedy, because I relpat. what I said a-l-ittle while ago, that I feel. amid I do not resent it, I feel that I have had slightly more than my share of the sensitive. cases, for a number of reasons. I ask you to accel)t my statement that. I have never avoided a sensitive case and hence, what I perhaps said in that l)aper long ago, it (toes represent my continuing philosophy.
"SenatorK I:x~n,. aTnly'ouikvery much. Youl have been extremely responsive to my questions. I want to thank you for your comments.

TheCi., ,immvxS. enator Bayh. Seni'tor BAVi. Think you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Blackmun, I listened with great interest to questions asked bmy~e amsyst(rlaisigt ihntigfouriswhaidrd,coolpleeapg1u1e1s1dma(1niddidy(o.ur responses winch imil)reSsed
I do haVe a few queStionsI] wohId like0 to ask. Before doing so, I would like to add my commendations to those of Senatorllart to the American Bar Association for the different
al)proach which they have take with this nomination. I also tiliik, iiiasmiuch as I have not been6ltotally laudatory toward

nation, sir, With a greater degree of care, anld the ifofol61a'tiOn which they havo Aiven us, which is to your credit, has been presmated in a
more orderly fashion in which tile apeafhnce of ciMIdor is obvious. It is my judgment, as facts are available iiow, that the fact that
a man of,your caliber, of your excellence, is before us today may indeed give some salve for the wounds which lhve beemfhidtirred because of last. confrontftions and very distasteful disagreements. Perhaps these old hAdtles have been worthwhile.
Let tie just tbuch very qfiickly on some of the points- tlhathave becin raised earlier to clarify my owni mind.
You have expressed, I 'think, very appropritely in tie cases of Nash v. Steanson and )YounVv. Jlayer,to recall twolthat I read about, the role of tM6 circuit court judge ini looking at a case aid coiifithring it. to what. the Supreme Court has said. It is fair to -say, is it not, from what I have heard here today and what I have read attributed to yoi I hope accum.ately, that you vould view y,'our role as a Supreme Couirt
Justice in a difternt ,capacity, from tiat as a circiit court judge? Perhaps I should refine that bv asking if you feel irrevocably bound to )ast. Supreme Court l)recedellts? in tie cases that I mentioned and in some of your statements you strewed precedent and stressed the role of lhe Supreme Court, but'now as a prospective Supreme Court .Justice, yourself, you will be in a ditllreent role. You might coimenit a bit further onthis diflerelit capacity. I wolhl app reciate it.
.Judge BJ.CKI. Of course, I ha'e ulot )een without criticism for my attitude as a judge of an inferior Federail court, onSupreme Court opinions, but I Supl)ose it comes, about because of the trtainil,g T have had and the attitude of sanctity toward the supreme tribunal of our land. Undoubtedly sitting on that court is a different assignmnt. To a lavver and to a judge, ,well, to amu, lawyer, this, of course, is the-this is the terrible end of the line of liiigatin. There is no further place to
go. The decision had better be right. This is an awesome reAlhitlion. Precedent, I think, is a very valuable thing lithe law. A lawyer has to say, however,, that it, is niot ani absolute. Judges, even
Justices'of the Supr-eme. Court, are. Imans and I sui~l)pose attitdes change as we gro along.
I have made statements before that the overruling by the Supreme
Court of a prior precedent is not a matter always of great alarm. I think this has happened throughout its history'. As times have chabgen, Justices have chAinged. People take a second look.

44
I think my answer, Senator Bayh, is tht I would have to start with precedlent which has been estalisled by Justices of experience, most of them with far greater intellect than I could lio)oe to conjure Ul). I take it from there and do the best I can. But as I tried to answer Senator Kenuedy, I shall endeavor to (to what I have always done as a judge, having the privilege of spring on the Federal cotirt of this land, to decide the case as I think it should be decided.
Senator h~.yn. I appreciate that fact, that one of legal training recognizes the iimiportaico of precedent.
Judge BLACKMUN. These are the rules by which we all try to live together.
Senator B.ir. I concur. Although precedent is strong, nevertheless it is not the kind of think we worship and I appreciate your explaining that.
In a New York Times article of April 20th, T think it was, you were quoted as saying maw is a social I)eing an(l law is in part social. I supposo this is in line With your answer to Senator Keniiedy, in1i'!rd to looking at the whole picitreanfd recognizing that times change?
Judge BiLW('KMUN. Well, despite the fact, that the press was on me at a very climatic, critical moment of my life, and I hardly know what I said, I think I w6ild agree with that statement Still.
Senator fltxii. Would you care to offer an observation-this goes to the point raised by Senator Kennedy in the speech lie made last evening. One of the news media con(lcted a poll on the il|l of Rights and between two-thirds and three-fourths of the people who were ppoolrlteiodnrseospf oflnuedeB(itlhl aotf tRheilyhtsv.oWuldounlodt lyoooukcwariethtodicsofmavmoernotnonretpheealrionlge of those amendments?

This is more of a political problem for which you, Senator Bayh, are better trained than I ever could be. As long as that Bill of Pights is there, this is--well, I accept it and I am not qualifled to state that .... cemrai inficpeonrttiionnsstroiffieitnto.u. ght, to be changed or repealed. I think it is a
Senator B.v-I. Well, I an not surprised to get. this response but, I think it. is important for us not to ignore the opportunity we have on occasions such as this to say to some of our citizens who might be swayed by teml)orar passions or emotions thatr they are treading oil very thin*ice if they getyinvolved in tampering with those freedoms, thole rights that have been so important to us.
Let. tie, if I may, get, into another area that I am sure will come as no surprise to you, an area that,has been the subject.of some discussion and concern in regard to one of the previous nominations, this whole business of ethical standards and conflict of interest..
I have expressed publicly and I express to you, sir, a great, reluctance as a himnan being to ju(lge another human being. Our system calls for somei of us to Ju(ge others. We may or may not, like it; but if we are participating iln carrying forth our responsibilities we must, accept this.

You have had a distinguished role in judging. Certainly those of us on the Senate .h(licdiary Committee are cAlled to jtllge the competence and qualifications of others as we do our duty.
I think particularly today, and I notice you stress this, with the changing times tile p ol)le are looking at. our system, are asking us to
pay more attention, to examine more closely somne of the things which we may have passed off, not intentionally, biut rather cavalierly before, and it is because of this continuing concern that. I have, that. I wait to pose some questions, if I may, sir, to you relative to financial interest.
Is ita,ccurate'to suggest that the information which was included in response to Senator Eastland's questions covered all of tie.outside income and all of the financial interest,that.you have held while you have been on the bench? The material provided to us by the Justice Depart.ment and incoi-porated in Mr. Kleindienst.'s letter]
Judge lBr,ACK.%tUN-. This is correct., sir. Senator BAY . I think I should say before going further, as I have said in previous hearings, I am not nearly so concerned as to what you or I may have done or may have thought, yesterday as I am about what we intend to do or we think today and tomorrow. As I understand Mr. Cleindienst's letter to the chairman of our committee, you have never sat on any cases involving any corporation or other entity for which you were then serving as an officer, director, or in any similar capacity. Is that.accurate? Judge BIACKMUX. That is accurate. Senator BAYI. Is it correct, that you never sat. on a case involving a party whon youirepresented as an attorney? Judge lJA,.%CK.1UX.. That is also correct., with the understanding that. I did sit on some cases which were clients of my old office pre1950 but which I have myself never represented. Senator B3,%Yi. That, is the question I was raising. And you say that is accurate. Judge IIJACK.NIX'.x. That is accurate. Senator B.A1T. Is it correct. that, you have never sat. in any case involviing a Iarty represented by your former law firm if the Iparty had been a client at. the time you were a member of tie firm ? Not, prior, but I think you just answered that. question, did you not.? .1ulgeBlACK3MtU.. I thought the word regular was in there. Regular client. Senator B.mi,. Yes. Judge BLACKMUN. Theanswer to that,iscorrect. Senator Rml . Now, there has been some notice in the newspapers in read to a few cases in which you (lid sit and you (idat the s"ame time have fiincial interests in one of the parties. It was as I recall, a relatively insignificant interest, iut that you did in fact sit on some of these cases. I know that it has been some time since 196) and I (to not want to ask questions unless yoiur memory has been- prol)erly refieshed, but it has been brought to my attention that (lie cases of Ihinson v. Forld Motor Co. in 1960. Koutula v. Ford Motor Co. in 1961, Mahoney v.N houM'estern Bell Telephone Co., and Jlinm.,ota

I would like to proceed out of these questi6ns to try to see where we go from here relative to standards for the Federal judiciary. 'If you feel, as a judge who will be siltlhg on the Supreme Court, hat Ihis would piut you in an adverse position, then I certainly will accept
your re fusal to comment. Those are, to your judgment, the only four cases that ,ou were in t)ny
way involved w'ith financiall that caine before ,,6u? .Judge BiAACK(1,,. I certainly have'tried hard to review the over
900 cases with which I have had something to do in my lphus Years. These are the oily four that I have uncovered. 'I'wo of them" were adverse toonijy so-called interests. Two were the other way. The thurd one, the NortItwestern'el, of course, was a step removed because I assume Northvestern Bell is a controlled subsidiarv of A.T & T.
It. was a foolish little case anyway, shouldnever have-been In Federal coui't. There was not any qiuestion of the decision. There was no real problem to it. But;those are the only ones, Senator Bayh.
Senator ,,viu. I Understand that there was one othemar, lhrhgenan v. (GatewayFord Truck Sales this year, in which you removed yourself from,thecase, i§ that.accurate?
Judge BL.ACKMI.v. This is correct. Sciator BAYL. Now, in these, cases that you did have the relatively insignificant, financial interest in, did any of them involve! a major legal issue or social issue that had an impact on the company or the
industry involved or was the impact of the case confined to the amount of money involved In the immediate case?
'Judge BlTACKMiU. I thini the answer to that is (lefiuitely the latter. The Hanson case was an alleged-was a situiat ion of alleged fraidulent representations made to a prospective dealer. ThemKofila case was a case under the Automobile I)ealers Franchise Act: for an alleged wronifIi termination of a particularr dealership in Mifinesota. The A'orthwestern Bell case, I cannot even tell you the merits because we never got to the merits. It was a l)rocedural' issue. It was not very im-
iortnt. Obviously there was not a great deal that was requested. The ,lfilnesotaMiing case was a typical patent action instituted

by 3 for patent. hfrIngelient. We held for the--we granted tile defendant's motion for summary jdgment. That, too, was a procediU';I matter,
I think cleai'lv none of these involved any social issues and nothing more than-nole of then was more than a private controversy betweell the iiiti eC t6 tbe lit igati6n.
Senator Bl;n. The"Alooy one that I cnin see i'ny possible broader implication in would be the Kotula case, where you 11ve the conflict bet Ween'the dealer and"the motor comlany, Ford Motor Co. itself. Would there have been any possibility ti~l if the courthaid ruled favorably for the dealer inthat 'ease thatitlis night.live~rrimlted other dealers to bring cases elsewhere outside of this ihiiftdlite case?

Judge BLACK.uN-;. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. The first. time I sat on the court, was at. the T oveinber 1959 session. It was on that calendar that, tile 11amson case appeared. And Ford Motor was involved.
Prior to my sitting I visited privately with Judge Johnsen, who was then chief judge of the Eighth circuit, and Judge Sanborn, who was sitting in a senior capacity, about. my ownership of thee few shares of 6rd stock. We also discussed the more general problem of what, was I to do if and when a case came into the court represented by my old office.
Clhief Judge Johnsen advised tie at. the time that my holding of Ford was so small that I should not, disrupt the court's calendar by (lisqilalifving. In fact, lie gave me a lecture about the integrity of the courtand the fact that I as a junior was to act. as a judge and not as somebody who is supersensitive to some of these outside mhinces.

Excerpt from letter dated April 16, 1970, front Senior Circuit Judge Harvey 31.

,Johnsen : "It our telephone conversation the otlier day, I did not offhanid recall

whether in our talk a number of years ago about stock interests there had been

mention of any particular stock or whether we had merely dealt with the subject

in general. I had had no occasion to give the incident any particular thought

silic, its occurrence. I have since allowed my mnind to go back into its archives to

recalpture the setting of you of your Forl stock.

the event. What has

You are right-there was slxcifle pulled the thing into focus for me

mention by was one of

those irrelevancies in which the human mid so often engages. I remember the

instinctive reaction which my Imind had (although this was ulone of my business)

of why your broker had :-old you on Ford stock as an Investmtent instead of Gen-

eral Motors. You are free to slate before ti(- Senate Judielary Committee and

anywhere else that I expressed the view that you should not disqualify yourself

from sitting on tite basis of this trilling Ford-stock Interest."

Senator B.mt. I want to explore with yon, if I may, the three general areas of ethical standards.
One, the. standards followed by a majority, of the ci cuits, says that any pecuniary interest quires (li qualifications.
'I'wo, in the fifth circuit, which the eighth circuit nfilst'follow, unless there is a substantial interest there need be no disqualification-and certainly the fact that you brought this to the attention of your fellow judges is to your ctdit.
he'lhe, tile fourth circuit permits the judge to disclose his interests it a ease anid then sit if the parties waive all), objection.
Now, have you given any thought ill the light of all you have gone through in the last few weeks as to what standard should be. the standard of the Supreme Court of tile ITn1ted States?
I might just share one or two thoughts that have been brought to our attention ill the. past few months. One has to weight the inconvenience so far as the (locket and this type, of thing is concerned mid the fact that a judge must give no appeaance of impropriety. This is important.
Professor Mellinkoff of the ITniversity of Southern California Law School wrote what I thought was a very pertinent letter during the consideration of aIprevious nomination "in which lie )ointed out that a seaman suing a shipping line who was turned (lown by an appellate court judLle would have great difficulty understandin'a eveni if the judge, had only a small interest ill the company. lie felt I)ersolially aggrieved or lie would not have blrolght the suit. he woul not have appealed it to tile circulit, and lie would have difficulty explainilg to himself. his friends, his neighbors, and to his fellow ,eamen. when he found out that one of the judges had even a small piece of the action of the corporation lie was suing.
The Commonrwealth (oafhin.q ease is the latest word o this area that I have been able to find from the Supreme Court, 393 U.S. 145, a 196ccase. I do not know how familiar you are with that. u)llIt want to mad a portion of that. opinion because'it accurately reflects the standards at least the Senator from Indiana feels we should strive toward.
The opinion was written by Justice Black and lie quotes from the Canons of Legal Ethics, No. 33, which says:

The Judge should, however, in ending or proslwtive litigation before hin. IKeparticularly careful to avold such action as may reasonably tend to awaken the suspicion that his social or business relations or friendshlips constitute an element in Influencing his Judicial conduct.

Then, Just ice Black goes ol to say:
This rule of arbitration and this canon of judicial ethics rests on the permise that any tribunal Isrinitted by law to try cases and controversies not only must be unldiased but titust 1lso avoil even lheIapparance of bias.
Now, could you just generally give us your thoughts in this case as to what standards we need to prescribe for the court?
Judge Bi[ACK.MUN. Yes, of course, I would be glad to, Senator Bayb. That case, I believe, is the arbitration case.
Senator I.\mri. That is accurate. And it does involve. an arbitration ruling, but the court in quoting Ithat ruling says that it. is highly signiflicant but is not bindling and thenl brings in the ('anons of Ethics and states, as I quoted, what really is a higher principle. I (o not. want to give you oniy part of the horse. I want you to look at the whole aniual. But the last. part, of the opinion, the part that I quoted, seems to me is the most significant.
,Jlldge BLACK-3MTN. I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that today I agree fully with what, Mr. Justice Black said. I think this is esSential. ('ertainly, on the Supreme Court it is in mY view, which may not be the best onle, it is vety! definitely essential. 'his is why I ask you to accept this as a fact. This is why I lisqualilied in Febritary of this year from the little very insignificant case seemingly iivolving the Ford agency. It discomforted the court because another judge disqualified with tine. lie remembered lie had some Ford stock, so we both went out. This is
Senator B.- ir. )id the case get trie{1 despite this? Judge BlcKMtuN. Sir?
Senator B.%Yir. l)id the case get,ludge HL.CK.UTt ,. Y'es, we signed it to another panel and they had to adjust but finally found a panel which did not have any aultomobile stock at all, tried it, and reversed--the result of the case was very obvious. It was a very easy case, if that has any signilicance. I would susi~ect that if this conllfirmation were to go through, the thing for ile to do is to dispose of these securities forthwith and take the risk of further inflation, but I (to state that these little securities of mine have been tucked awav-I think the record does demonstrate I have not been in and out of the market. I put them away, really forgot about then, and maybe that is the way it should he. Senator Bmt. r[hen I suggest that i; it fair to describe under U.S.C. 28-455, substantial interest means any pecuniary interest in the circumstances surrounding,Judge B,,m-ti'Um'x. If your question iq whether I would so construe it in a litigated case, then I would have to try to figure out, what the words "substantial interest" in section -155 meant as applied to me of late years, I hope, and in the future, I most sincerely 1iope. I would interest. it as you have just described it.
Senator BI,,-,. hlopefullyvwe will be successful in amending the
statutes some of us are considering to apply the Blackmu standard to IT.S. Code 28,455.
Senator So-r. And to the Congress. Senator Khiv-i. I heartily concur with what my friend from Pennsylvania says.
ludge W.\C.RT'x. Senator, I WWI to say again my response is only in judgment of myself under 4.55. Today'it reads "substantial inter-

est." But if I were ever called to pass upon what, that meanlt rearding someole else then I would try to interpret the statute in light, of its history and ninii g. For me, I repeat, your description is the applicable standard.

Dr. Balfour was a son-in-law of Dr. William J. Mayo. I-had kliown him for yearsn,hedttlA'ting my going to Rochester, Mfim. his will was drawn in 1959, before I went on the bench. I was one of three name(I executors. lIe (ied in 1903.
1 served with another inlividual an(dthe corporate execitor, mainly because, except, for one daughter, his family lived away from M1innesota. I took no fee it|hat estate.
The second one is the estate of Mabel Van Camlpen Kqahler the widow of Mr. Kahler, to whom I inade rtference before, She (lied in September 1958- mire thani a year before I was appointed to the bench. Ier estate was well underway before I went on the bench. I was one of four executors.
The CHAnRMN,.. Let, us have order. Judge BIACKMUX. And the estate was concluded after I was on the bench. In this estate, I was given a fee of $.3,500. The estate was in excess of a half million dollars, The attorneys' fees were $19,000. The
corporate executor's fee was $12,000. I say in all caindor I was reluctant to take that fee but. did so largely
on the"insistence of the decedent's only (laughter, who was the wife of Dr. Tiench, Nobel prize winner foi the'clinicaj application of cortisone.
The third one was that of Charles 0. 0 Ihan. lis will was drawn in 1955, 4 years before I went, on the bench. The residue of his estate went to the fayo Association and thus Was eleemosynary in disposition. I was one of the three named individif4l execitors, among which was the widow. We were given the pi*ilege to niiiiate a bank as corporate executor. This was done. The bank served in thht capacity with us. The estate was somewhat in excess of a million d1II. I have
known it well because I had khoWn Mr.- Gilfillan for a long time. And
the fees there foe the bank were $18,000, for the attorneys, $22,000, and

a fee of $5,000 eaI6ftonme, again at the insistence of the widow, who is a close, I hope, personal feiend6f Irile.

And'at one point I think I did say that. I would like to see the country or the Supreme Court or all judges adopt,tho Blacknun standard relative to ethical conflicts of Iiit6rest. That statement on 11y part. apparently was il reasonable proximity to a statement that you had maide in regard to your thof ght that, l)erhaps it would be best for you to sell your stocks and thke.a chance on inflation. I do not. want, niy remarks in regard to -oiflts of interest to suggest that all judges ought to sell alitheir stocks. 'I do niot thiik that that should be the rule at all, but that we should be very careful not to have a conflict of interest where we do own stock and sit. on a case.

Theic incapacitated judge is. can be a distinct problem. It is the other

Senator BYUD. Mr. Chairnman, reference. was made this morning to

I believe, our young

on thle people

are not correctly expressed by those who have been paticipating in

takeovers of admihistrati6n buildings and college campuses, and who have otherwise protested loudly against what we often hear referred to ast lie "system."
Of course, the voices of those who participate in rebellious activities are heard and are given much fanfare, but the average student who goes to college or to a itfiversity to get an education is busy working in the laboratories, in the libraries, and in the classrooms'and he is not heard or seen on television.
There is a generation gap. There alWays has been. There, was one when I was in my teens, and there will 'always be a generation gap
to overcome.
But it can be done because children will always respond, as they whahviechinintthhee fpiansatl, antoalyusnidsemrsutsatnsdtianrgt wainthd tthoe hdoismci.pline and to love-

So I would wantthe record to show, Mr. Chairman, that when

reference is made to the highly touted alienation of youth and to

the criticism of tile so-called "system -and I say this most respect-

fully-there are many people in this country who (o not feel that

such alienation and criticism are the noim, lbut rather are made to

appear as the prevailing mood among our yoli!g people.

Some personal references were made to your children, Judge Black-

inun, as a result of questions that were asked of you-quite properly

so-and perhaps I would, therefore, be forgiven likewlse for a per-

sonal reference. I have two daughters whom I consider to be young

As I said, my son-in-law came from Persia to America. lie came here because of the system and because of the oplportuniiies that are inherent. in the system. Other lpeo)les have come to this country because of the system. We have not seen young men leaving this coulitry

Judge BLAVK.UN. I canl fully undlerstand, sir, your pride in this young man. I hope one day to b able to say tie same thing about my sons-mn-law. Tlhey are working at it.
Senator Byhi). Mr. Chairman, on the basis of my own investigations, I am satisfied as to tle integrity of the nominee and his ability, as well as with the correctness ot his philosophy concerning tile Droper funct ions of Supreme (oilrt Just ices.
His opinions appear to*reflect. pidicial1 restraint, a clear resl)ect for judicial l)recedent. an( a recognition of the constitutional (lemarcation of authority between time judicial and the legislative bramiphes.
His opinions also reflect, I believe, a proper es)ect for that. line of demarcation, anlI believe, therefore, that. we can correctly assume and hope that, in his future actions in tie high office to W'hich he has beei niomniinated lie will netcontribute to a further usurtiomi of the fulictcns of the legislative branch. I, therefore, coi'liiinent ,Julge Blackmnm on his record, on his nomination, and oil his al)pear-
ane before this committee, and I expect to sti)port the nomination. The CImut.%x. Senator Iruska ? Senator I hir-KA. Mr. Chairman, the nominee before us isno shrager
to this room. lie sat, here 11 years ago in the same position-it may evell have beemi the same clhir-when this committee conducted its hearing into his qualifications for tie, judgeship in the Eighth Circuit (Coutof ApI)peals. It was this Senator who presided o'Ver fhat heariimg, and I recall it. with a great, deal of pleasure. It was a real honor to

have served in that capacity in lieu of the chairman who was absent.

on official business.

There is another reason why Judge Blackmun (toes not sit. here

as a stranger to me. Nebraska is in the eighth circuit, and of the

many judges whose work I have followed Since becoming a member

of this committee I have observed .Judge Blackmun's decisions and his

actions a little closer than most because of the relationship between

Nebraska and tle eighth circuit.

I have read many of his decisions and I am in frequent. contact

with some of his felow judges, notably the two who live in my home

city, former chief judge of the eight circuit, Harvey Johnsen, and

Don Lay. I)on Lay, I note, when lie was approved by'the Senate was

confirmed at an earlier age than most of the cireut or the district

court judges on the bench today. Judge Richard Robinson, the district

court, judge in Oniaha, was especially laudatory in a recent conversa-

tion about the part that. the judge lclays and w.orks-at. in his l)resent

official capacity. Judge Van Pelt, in Lincoln, only 50 miles; away,

feels much the same.

There is no better way to judge a. man than by his work andlthe

appraisal of those who have worked with him in the same business.

That, of course, is tihe profession of law and -the administration of a

court. of justice.

MAy own personal survey demonstrates to me that this nominee Mr.

Chairman, is held in the highest regard by his contemporaries at the

bar"and on the bench. This attitude is widespread and it. should not.

be a source of sirlprise.

I join with my colleagues in commending the American Bar As-

sociat ion for the

-ethpeoyrt have ren(ier d in this I)articilar instance.

It is a new system, a new approach, I think l)erhaps morm detailed and

in greater depth than before, and it. has been reported in splendid

shape.

This committee has never abdicated its responsibility in favor of

the American Bar Association or the Judicial Conference, or any

other bo)dy, in(lividual, or group. We like to get advice from them,

but of course we have to use our own judgment in making our final

decision.

But I want. to say that it is comforting to get men like those who

are serving with Jidlge Walsh on the Federal jtidiciaiy, the Com-

mittee on Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Assciation, and

have them give their opinion as they have. It. is comforting and it, is

of very high value.

So I commend the American Bar Association for its willingness to

have joined in this effort, and I commend them particularly for re-

serving the ol)portulnit.y to sui)plemenit. their report. after these hear-

ings are completed so that they will be able to make a final judlgment

on tie. basis of the sme material and evidence which is before this

committee.

ow, Judge Bhackmun, luring the hearing this morning yo, were

asked certain questions designed to elicit your awareness and your co-

cern about certain social problems, and other maladjustmelnts in our

society. I thought your answer to that question was very forthright miid

very good. I recall that you indicated you were aware itfhem andtlat

yol had concern for them. Isn't iftr-ite however, that there will be a

different response from different l)eople in regard to such a concern?

Institutions under our constitutions perform ditl'ereit fun6tions in

solving these social ills. Not all are given the sime power. Isn't it

true, Judge llackimun, that a Supreme Court and the members

thereof are bound pretty much by the record of the case before them
and by the ('onstiffiti;4I of the United States. h'lhey cannot and

should not. venture beyond the record and beyond the Constitution

or beyond the state of the law anid violate and distortt the Constitution

in all etort to try to achieve an alleviation of celfain well-known evils.

The same woul(l be. true of people ini a legislative field such as the

members of this committee. We have our limitations. We can legis-

late to be sure, but it. is always.sub'ect to the. limitations p)laccd on us

by the Constitution and of course by the courts.

Now, I can understand how one would be concerned with the social

and the economic proIblels, and yet, at tile same time just. because

there is an awareness then and a great concern about it does not indi-

cate. (toes it, that he can (to almost anything and everything to try to

rect i fy those. problemss ?

Judge BlACKMUN. Senator l ruska, I think there were several ques-

tions there. As I went. along of course the answer to all except. the last

is in the definite affirmative. I strongly believe in olr system of checks

and balances and in our three-branch system of government. As you

point out, the Constitution in Federal cases is always part of the record. I firmly believe in deciding cases on the record. I hllope I have

never done therwise.

I firmly believe that change, if change comes, must come within the

framework of tie law as we understand it. And not outside the law.

Senatim IitusKi,. It had to (to with tihe power of public officials to (to

Senator ITRusiK,%. Now, questions have been asked on the general

subject, of conflict of interest and of loyalties once held. That is not a

from past. loyalties. In the instance of your representation, for ex-

And I will pledge t 1-17th of the vote of this comniittee on my own behalf to see that you get a chance to have your name placed before tie Senate Chamber.

Judge Blackiin-, you are a graduate of the-1itarvard law school class of 1932; ig that correct.? Jutdgo BILKMU.N. That is correct. Senator Foxo.

Thank you, Senator Fong. Senator F'oxo. I only have one question, jldge"IIackmntnl to ask you, and that relates lothe question of capital l)unishlilteft tile case of P1ope v. the United ,Stales,37'2 Fed., 2(d 710, decided it) 1067 fronian appeal of a judgment if the districtt coui't imposing the deAth sentence on at bank robber who killed three employees of a bank ill tile process of robbing it, you wrote'1he oplihion of tle court of appeals affirming the decision of capital punishment.; is that. correct? Jutlge BLACKMUX. 'hat is correct. We sat en bane in that case. Senator FoNG. Yet, as I understand, reading from the newspapers the other (lay, you did mention something about capital 'punllliiint wheni that question was put. to you. I believe you stated that it, might well be that the Supreme Coirt might say that the impositibn of capUA~ilhl lih'ent would be a very cruel-himi-g; is that correct? It would be cruel and uiusial-Iunishmient, utinder the Constitution. Did
you make that statement,? .Judge BLACKMUN. This is the chronology after the Pope case. The
Pope case, of coumse, was a very celebrated case out i our part of the Country. This was a young nmn graduated with hionors from his college oni Sunday and onl Fridlay comitted these Ohies. Ini a, Iater case of Mfaxrweli v. Stephens and a still later case of Afaxiell v. Bishop which is now before the Supreme Court. of tile United States we
were also coitfronted with tihe issue of capital punishment. In ail bf those cases the eighth atiiendnent argument. was made. In each and aarlgl uomt tehnots. e cases we upheld tie penalty against the eighth amendment.
In the Iast. one, ill Maxiwell v. Bishop, I made the gintuitous observation which has caused so much furor, that, it, was particularly excruciating for one who is iot. convinced of the rightness of capital
il)unIs'luent as a deterrent in crime, This, Senator Fong, is a lorsonlt conclusion on my part. It. is a part. of personal philosophy. I think time other question of the rightness of legislation, be it by a State legislature,, or by Congress in dealing with Federal crimes, to impose the death penalty is an entirely different, question. It hap-

pens that I grew up in a State, Minnesota, whieh" has not had tile death peniaty since 1911. in miy entire lifetime within fl y memory it, has not been an issue. And when I came on the court. there were immediately three or four instances where we were asked to stay executions scheduled for the next. (lay. In none of those cases did we enter a stay order. In each of them as I recall the eighth amendment issue was raised.
And I stated in connection with the observation which the press has latched onto, I think I can quote it verbatim. I also stated that ordinarily the imposition of the death penalty is a matter for the discretion of the legislature. I firmly believe this. One of course cin imagine if a Legislature were to Impose the death penalty on a pedestrian for crossing the street, against, a red light this mlght be something else again.
Senator FoNo. That would be very unreasonable?
,Judge B1.ACKM3UTN. Sir?
Senator FoNo. Th at. would be very unreasonable? Judge,BLACKMU.N. I would think so.
Senator Foxo. Yes.
,Judge BAcK.. But my other observation to which vou nihke reference about. the tree justices, this is the case of Ritdolph v. Alabama, certiorari denied, with three justices in dissent, stating
that they would like to hear argument on the issue whether the i]-
position'of tile death penalty for the crime of rape where the vi im is not, harmed would be in "violation of the eighth amendment. For
me this is not. really a very difficult, matter in the context of our cases because in every one of them the victim was not. left unharmed. And so even inlthe -view of the three dissenting justices, it seemed to me there was no real problem. I merely sensed in Rudolph. v. Alabama,
the first. instance in recent years 'in any event, of justices of the Supreme Court being concerned basically with file eighth amendment. argument. It has caused me no problem personMly, My personal feeling about. it. is on one side, it could change tomorrow.
My attitude toward eilelegislative aspect is another thing. I have stated what my initial approach to it is, and certainly I would never want to decide that question without its being frequently briefed and adequately argued.
Senator FoNo. So you feel that, at tile present. time there really is not definitive attitude as far as you are concerned, no very definite attitude that capital punishment should be abolished?
Judge BACK'mux. This is my personal philosophy. If I were legislator and it, came up, probably this is the vay I wV'ould initially feel depending in -ari't oil any overwhelmiig Attiuide on tile part of -my
constituents. But. otherwise, apart from that, I start. witllt e premise that tilis is basically a legislative discretioiiary matter
Senator Fo.o. Anid if tile Legislature says tilat capital punishment should be imposed you would follow tIat?
'Judge BiACrt;x. Certainly, with anl exception perhaps in mIy pe-
destrian illustration. Senator Foxo. Yes. I can understand. Many people feel that with
tle abolition of capital lIunisiment, for example, a convict i i'thme penitentiary may continue to kill, and there have been cases in many jurisdictions in which a convict has killed other convicts in the pei-

tentiary knowing that he will not be subjected to capital punishment. Would you like to comment onthat?
Judge BLACKMUN. Yes, indeed. We have had similar cases rise in our circuit, and I have learned how explosive this issue is in the-public mind the last few weeks. I am not a. legislator.
Well, I have stated my attitude toward it. I respect" the legislative mind, and this is where I start, and I-think probably that is where I finish.
Senator FoNo. Well, I am satisfied with your answer to my question. Thank you. And in conjunction with my "colleague, Senator iruska, you can count, on two-seventeenths now rather than one-seventeenth.
Judge BLACK3[uN. Thank you, Senator.
Senator MCCLELLAN. Senator Thurniond? Senator TUn3r.ox.oD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Blacknmn, I congratulate you upon your appointment as an associate justice of the-U.S. SupremeCourt. This is a high honor indeed, and I am sure that you are aware of the sighificdnce of it and the responsibilities faced by the highest judi-
cial body in our Government. I have carefully studied your personal record and it. appears that. you are a man of high ethical con'dc'iift, as was Judge Ilaynsworth, and a man of competence, as was Judge Carswell. The labor and civil rights leaders vigorously fought. and-defe-ated the noillinations-of Judge Ilaynsworth and Judge Carswell and vented their spleen against them, but. I predict, that they no longer have the gall to'engage in another roind of defamation of character andthfiat. you will be confirmed forthwith. I am glad that. President Nixon has characterized you as a strict constructionist, because even a Supreme Court. justice is narrowly constrained by the intent of the framers of the Constitution and I)y the intent of Congress in making our laws. If this were adhered to'in every case, there would be no need to worm about, balancing the Court. since the question of liberalism and conservativismi vould not.arise.
Judge Blackmun, after you are confirmed, I trust and believe that you will accept the Constitution of the United States as the rule for your decisions. I have no questions. I shall support your nomination.
Judge BLACK.UN. Tfhiank you, Senator Thurmond. Senator MfCCLFLLTAN. Senator Cook? JSuendagteorBClaocokKm. Tunh,anitk. iysoau, pMlera.sCurheaitromhanav. e you here.

ple, I do not believe that. will ever change. I am interested in one of the aperss that,you have written. As the
record shows, you have prepared three papers, two of which unless you are from Minnesota, or unless you represent, a great. mai doctors and tax clients not. very many people would be interested in, but I think your third-one, "'the Allowance of In Forma Paul)eris Appeals in Section 2255 and Habeas Corpus Cases" is most interesting.
And, Mr. Chairman, when I finish, I would like to put thus article in the record if I may.

Senator 'MCCLELIAN. It may follow your interrogation of tlip nominee.
Senator COOK. I think that two of the remarks that you make in your conclusion are most interesting, and I WNidhlike io read them Iurely and simply because I think it shows the type of strict. constructionist that fin fact believe that you are. It also shows the compassion that every man who attains the judicial robes must also have, and'that starts out first of all in item 3 of your conclusions when you said, and I quote:
The concept that. In forma paupers procedure Is a privilege, rather than a right, is perhaps somewhat suspect today despite continuing lip .ervice to it. In one sense, it may be a privilege, but the .overeign has chosen to grant It and it thereby assumes certain characteristics of right.
And obviously you are talking in terms of the section of the Constitution that ailws habeas corpus in the first place regardless of its apparent limitations under 2255?
Judge BI.,CKNUN. Correct.
Senator COOK. And your last one, which tthink speaks a great deal of you as a judge, as a practitioner, is item 15, and I quote:
Let us in this entire area, until the Supreme Court instructs us otherwise, be willing to act as responsible judges, to evaluate each case, and to make a considered judgment. If we are reversed occasionally, what does it matter? Our professionAl satisfaction lies in a job performed responsibly and not In avoidIng responsibility.
Now, there are two other thigs I would like to read in the record, Judge, for your benefit, and that is in regard to the questions asked by Senator Hart in regard to what is a strict constructionist. And I believe that you have set forth your principles very well in a paragraph from Ashe v. ,Siwensonwhen you said:
This court Is not the Supreme Court of the United State.. We, therefore, are not free to disregard an existing national and still live holding of the Supreme Court even though that holding is one by a sharply divided tribumi1, and even though only one of the Justices who participated il 'the majority decision remained active. A change In constitutional concept and the overruling of an existing decision, If Indicated at all, is for the Supreme Court and is not for us. Firmness of precedent otherwise could not exist.
And one other quote that I would like to make, Judge, is in the case that was decided in your court in April of 1970 in re Weitzman, and you said:
If Mrs. Weltzman's constlutIonal arguments are to prevail, our concepts of constitutionality have progressed far beyond the llughes-lolones-Brandels days when enunciated allegiance and devotion to the country had primary and significant meaning. As a member of an inferior Flederal court, I feel that we cannot go that far even In this permissive day.
To me, #Judge,this is what a strict constructionist means. I think it not only shows his respect and love for the law but. his respect and love for precedent, his respect in his colsidertflon of stare decisis, and I would only conchide, Judge Blackmun, with your confirmation, which I confidently predict, we come to the end, inv my opinion, of a significant era in Supreme Court. history and in fact senatorial history. All of us must determine Wliatrit has meant, what standards have evolv&d which the Senate shall apply to Supreme Court nominees and how many of us have been consistent to our standards even with the era which your confirmation will end.

63
And I might say that I would like to have more to say about this era and what, lessons should have been learned bY the Senate, but I do not. think this is the proper place and I would like to take advantage ofIthmatusotpspaoyr,ttuonyitoyu ltAhatetr.it will be my privilege to support your nomi-
nation. It, will be my privilege to support it. as a strict constructionist, as a man who not oily loves the law but. has a tremendous compassion for it.
Thank you. Judge BI4 ACKMtUN. Thank you, Senator Cook. (The articles referred to by Senator Cook tid accepted by the chairman for inclusion in the record at.this point., follow:)
ALLOWANCE OF IN FORM PAUPF.RiS APPEALS%IN 1 2255 AND IIABEAS CORPUS
CASES '
(By Harry A. Blackman, United States Circuit Judge, Eighth Circuit)
On April 10, 1067, the Supreme Court of the United Stntes decided Nowakowskl v. Maroney, 386 U.S. 542, 87 S.Ct. 1107, 18 L..Ed.2d 282 (1907). This is a two page unanimous per curiam opinion. As you might expect from its brevity, the opinion is direct and to the point. Nowakowski was a Pennsylvania state prisoner. lie alleged the denial of the assistance of counsel in his state criminal trial and sought a federal writ of habeas corpus. The habeas court appointed a lawyer for him, held a hearing, and concluded that there there had not been a denial of fis constitutional right to counsel. But the district judge issued the certificate of probable cause which Is necessary under 28 U.S.C. § 2253, for any state prisoner to appeal a denial of federal habeas corpus.
Court-appolnted counsel were then I)ermltted to withdraw. Nowakowski petitioned the Third Circuit to allow his tijPal In forma pauperls and to appoint new counsel for him. Both aspects of this motion were denied by the court of appeals In a brief order without a bearing. Certiorari was granted as was k-ave to proceed as a poor person. 384 U.S.9S4, 8 S.Ct. 1893, 10 I,.d.2d 1003.
The Supreme Court held that this denial by the Third Circuit was error. While the Court recognized that "weighty consideration" should be given a district judge's prior denial of an application for a certificate of probable cause, it ruled, on the other hand, that when the judge Issues the certificate, "the court of appeals must grant an appeal in Jorma paupcris (assuming the requisite showing of poverty), and proceed to a disposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary procedure."
That Is all there is to Noicakowski. Once a district judge issues that certificate of probable cause In a state prisoner's federal habeas ease, he binds his appellate court to accept the appeal, whether paid or in forma patiperis, in its ordinary routine. When the trial court Issues the certificate, the court of appeals has no discretion to second-gue.ss the district Judge on the issue of probable cause. The Eighth Circuit, of course, has recognilzed Nowakocski. Gro,; v. Bishop, 377 .241 492 (8 Cir. 1967).
It Is this decision, I understand, which prompted your program committee to place on the agenda of this conference the subject, "Allowances of In Forma
Pauperis Appeals in 5 2255 and Habeas Corpus Cases." Does your committee
thereby possibly suggest that each district judge who Is here should bear In mind ihat perhaps a probable cause certificate is not necessarily to be.granted as a matter of course without some earnest considertaton of the underlying Substance of the applicant's case? Does it possibly suggest, also, that each appellate court Judge who is here bear In mind that perhaps a probable cause certifleate is not neces.-arily to be Issued by him as a matter of course, whenever the district Judge has denied it, without some earnest consideration of the underlying substance of the applicant's case?
We must, of course, examine the statutes. Because we are concerned with in forma pauperis appeals, we look at four statutes in the following order: first, 28 U.S.C. j 1915, which governs proceedings and appeals in forma papueris gener-
'Delivered at the Eighth Circuit Judicial Conference, Sept. 18, 1067.

ally; then I 2253, which has to do with habeas appeals; then 22.55: and finally

75(f), the Court Reporter Act.

I. Section 1915

A. Its general nature.

28 U.S.C. § 1915. Proceedings in fornia lauperis

(a) Any court of the United States may authorize the commencement,
prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees and costs. * * *

An appeal may not be taken in forma pauperls ifthe trial court certifies

in writing that it is not taken in good faith. * * *

It isat once apparent that this statute is very broad in its application and

reach.

1. It is broad because it vests the power to authorize in forma pauperis

procedure in "any court", trial or appellate. It would appear that in forma paupers appellate relief Is not dependent upon the existence of In forina pauperis

procedure in the district court. 2. It is broad because the prclure is available at any stage of the litigation.

The statute refers to commencement. prosecution or defense, or appeal.

3. It is broad because it applies to either sile of the litigation, to "prosecution

or defense".

4. It is broad because it applies to civil as well as to criminal matters.

5. It is broad lit other reslects. Thus, by subsection (b), If a printed record

is required by an appellate court. the court may direct the expense of even that

printing to be paid by the United States. We therefore have a statute which is comprehensive as to court as to tile

stage of the proceeding, as to prosecution or defense, as to the nature, criminal

or dvii, of the litigation, and as to other monetary detail. Seemingly, It makes

available to the indigent person. in a deserving situation, the same access to the

federal court, trial or appellate, as Ispossessed by the paying litigant. Tis very

accessibility, as you kitow, has been emphasized again and again by the Supreme

Court.

Despite all this, the general wording of the entire statute is not mandatory

but Is permissive. For the most part, it reads lit terms of "may", not of "shall".

"Any court of the United States may authorize"; the court "may *

direct";

the court "may request an attorney to represent. * * *"

Presumably because of this permissive language, there are a number of cases

in which courts of appeals have said that in forma pat;pers procedures is a

privilege and not a right. The District of Columbia, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth

Circuits all said so it cases decided before 1957. Dorsey v. (ill, SO S.App.I).C. 9,

148 F.2d 857, 877 (M15), cert. denied 325 U.S. & )0.6,5S.Ct. i50, 9 L.Ed. 2003;

lPar,-elil v.United States, 218 F.2d 92.32, 235 (5 Cir. 1955) :Barkeli v. Ford Motor

C9., 230 1'.2d 729, 731 (9 Cir. 19.56) ; CIough v. hunter, 191 P.2d 516, 518

(10 Cir. 1951).

This privilege characterization, for the most iart' antedates Johnson v.United

States, 352 U.S. 565, 77 S.Ct. 550, I LFId2d 593, decided March 4, 1957. The

Supreme Court there held (1) that the district Judge's certification that the

appeal Is miottaken Iingood faith "isnot final in the sense that the convicted

defendant isbarred from showing that itwas unwarranted"; (2) that tiletrial

judge's certificate "carries great weight but, necessarily, Itcannot be conclusive";

(3)that "Upon a proper showing a Court of Appeals has a duty to displace itDis-

trict Court's certification"; (4) that the defendant or his assigned counsel "must

Isenabled to show that the grounds for seeking an appeal * * * are not frivolous

and do not justify the finding that the appeal Is not oughtt it good faith"; and

(5) that It Is essential that the defendant be assured some appropriate means,

such as tIle court's notes. or an agreed statement by trial counsel, for showing

the basis of his claim that the court committed error in the certificate. This ho0ld

ing would seem to cast a clear and definite shadow on any rigid concept that In

forma paupers procedure is a privilege and not a right.

Nevertheless. even since the 19M57 decision in Johnson, courts of Appeals on

occasion have still characterized the procedure as al privilege. Coomez v.United

States, 245 P.2d 346, 347 (5 Cir. 1117) :Weller v.blckson, 314 F.2d 598. 000 (9

Cir. 1963), cert. denied 375 U.S. 845, 84 S.Ct, 97, 11 I,.l.2d 72: Smart v. lleluze,

347 F-.2d 114, 116 (9 Cir. 195)), cert. denied 392 U.S. 896, 80 S.Ct. 192, 15 L.Ed.2d

153; Moore v.Taylor. 289 F.2d 450(10Cir. 19061), cert. denied 368 U.S. 853, 82

S.Ct. 90, 7 LTIl.2d 102.

The Eighth Circuit, too, has described in formal paupers procedure as "entirely
statutory" and as a privilege and not a right. This was done In 1950 in an opinion
by Judge Dewey, Willis v. Utecht, 1M5 F 2d 210, 212 (8 Cir. 1950), cert, denied 340 U.S. 915, 71 S.Ct. 286, 95 L.I.d 651, and in 1952 it an opinion by Judge Sanboni, Higgins v. Steele, 195 F.2d 366, 368 (8 Cir. 1952). Later, however, in 1958, the
court, in a per curtain opinion, obviously written by Judge Sanborn, specifically
questioned this. Weber v. United States, 2M.F.2d 713, 714-715 (8 Cir. 1958).
14. The standards of § 1915(a). A reading of the statute reveals inmmediately that It projects two standards. The first is in I 1915(a), which provides that an appeal may not be taken in forma pauperls if the trial court certifies litwriting that It is not taken "in good faith". The second is in I 1915(d), which provides that the court may dismiss the case ifit "is satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious". Are these two standards Identical? What does good faith mean? Does absence of good faith equate with frivolity or maliciousness? oes § 1915(d) apply only to the district court and not at all to the appellate court? Does the double feature of the statute suggest that a trial court should only rarely certify that an appeal is not taken in good faith because the appeal is subject to dismissal anyway by the appellate court? Five Suprene Court cases decided in the last decade provide answers or indications of answers to sonic of these questions which so obviously arise upon a
cursory reading of § 1915. The cases are .Tohnson v. United States, 352 U.8.565. 77
S.Ct. 554, 1 L.d.A.2d 593 (1957), which has already been referred to; Farley v.
United States, 3451 U.S. 521. 77 S.Ct. 1371. 1 ,Ed.2d 1529 (1957) ; Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 074, 78 S.Ct. 974, 2 1,.EdI.2d 1060 (1958); Coppedge v.United States, 369 U.S. 43R, P2 S.Ct. 917, 8 I,.FAl.2d 21 (19062); and Hardy v. United States. 375 U.S. 277, 81 S.Ct. 424, 11 ,.1-A.2d 331 (1961). Not all of these were
unanimous and there are significant observations ilcnoncurrence as well as in dissent. All five were direct appeals from federal criminal convictions.
We do not have the time here carefully to analyze these five opinions. One may fairly say, however, that these cases clearly disclose the attitude of the Supreme Court toward the in forma paupers § 1915. The impoverished 6plPlicant is to he afforded procedural protection equaling with that po ses.s. ed by the more affluent applicant. If counsel is requested and provide(l, as now required on direct appeals, that representation must lie truly adequate, that is, counsel must lie alladvocate and not merely an alicus. And, if a record is necessary, al adequate record, even. in certain situations, a complete record, must he provided. "Good faith" in the statute is tilperesentation of any issue "not plainly frivolous". No isrtleular degree of merit or probability of success need he shown. Good faith Is to be measured by an objective, not a subjective, standard. Equal treatment is emplhasized. The government has tie burden. The possibility of a rational argunient ol either the law or the facts Is enough. In other words, doubt is to be resolved in favor of tilaepplicant. Looking at it front another point of view. one may appropriately say that the in forma pauperis appeal is not to be denied simply because the trial judge Is of tiloepinion that the appeal has no merit. The test is not whether the appea l has merit but whether there is an issue which is not plainly frivolous it the situation. Page v.United States, 272 F.2d 16 (S 'ir. 1959). or whether the appliealit can make some rational argument. Naturally, the application of this standard is not always easy.
One miay. of course, argue that these five Supreme Court opinions pronounce rules applicable only to direct criminal appeals. Are these sane rules and the reasoning which produces then equally applicable as a general proposition to in forma pauperis appeals in civil cases and in habeas corpus and 1 2255 appeals, both of which are civil in nature, even though they attempt to overcome criminal convictions? See, for example. Baker v. t'nited States, 3.31 F.2d 444, 447 (14Cir. 1964).
One finds, first of all, that there are civil damage cases where the courts say the same in forma pauperis standards are applicable, Thus, in John v. Glbson, 270 F.2d 36 (9 Cir. 1959). cert. denied 361 IU.S. 970, s0 S.Ct. 601, 4 L.Ed.2d 549, tilceourt held that tite test to be applied is that stated in RFlzs, but that the appeal may be disinissed if It would also te disinissed in tie case of a nonindigent litigant. This Ninth Circuit view, however, finds one dissenter from it on the present court, for Judge -Duniway, concurring in Weller v. ilckson, suprA, p. 03 of 314 F.2d, states that the rules may not lie tile swane inI civil cases.
Tite Eighth Circuit touched upon timis question in Cohen v. Curtis Publishing Co., 3,33 F.2d 974, 978-979 (8 Cir. I964), cert. denied 380 UT.S. 921, 85 S.Ct. 923, 13 L.IPA.2d 808. lit that private antitrust action the district court denied the

66
plaintiff's motion for leave to appeal In forma paupers and certified thit the appeal was not taken in good faith. The defendants, pursuant to then civil Rule 75(J) [now, essentially, Rule 75(g)], moved to docket and dismiss. The eighth Circuit granted that motion although it recognized that a motion to dismiss on grounds of frivolity or lack of good faith "should be granted only in extreme cases". Our court made no reference to the In forma lauperis standards enunciated hi the direct criminal appeal cases. The Ninth Circuit has a similar recent case where relief was afforded in civil rights litigation but wthout menton of the direct criminal appeal standards. Stiltner v. Rhay, 322 F.2d 314 (9 Cir. 1963), cert. denied Stiltner v. Washington, 376 U.S. 920, 84 S.Ct. 678, 11 L.Ed.2d. 615.
In federal habeas cases one finds similar comment. The Tenth Circuit has flatly held, in cases concerning In forma paupers procedure generally (and not the specific Issues of appointment of counsel, cost-free record, and the like), that the standards enunciated Inthe cases Involving direct criminal appeals are to be applied to habeas matters. The primary case Is Ragan v. Cox, 305 P.2d 58 (10 Cir. 1902). There the court cited both BUs and Coppcdge and acknowledged that those decisions were direct appeals. Nevertheless, the standards were api~ted. In addition, the court stated that the phraseology difference between the provisions for appeal in I 1915(a), that is, "not taken In good faith," and the provision for dismissal in 1 1915(d), that is, "frivolous or malicious," are "not material." I am not sure that this last observation was essential for the decision but its presence Is of Interest. Another Tenth Circuit case is Tidmore v. Taylor, 323 F.2d 88, 90 (10 Cir. 1903).
The Ninth Circult, In habeas nfatters, has cited the Tenth Circuit casesanfid has used the Supreme Court phraseology specifically. "It is frivolous only if the applicant can make no rational argument on the la'v or facts in support of his claim for relief." Blair v. People of State of California, 340 F.2d 741, 742 (9 Cir. 1965) ; Pembrook v. Wilson, 370 Fl2d 37, 39 (9 Cir. 19060).
Parenthetically we may note here that some of these cases make the observation that the proper procedure In the district court Is to grant the petition to proceed in forma pauperls and then, if it appears that the matter is frivolous, to dismiss under j 19151(d). This statement has been made in a federal habeas case, Oughton v. United States, 310 F. 2d 803, 804 (10 Cir. 1962), cert. denied 373 U.S. 937, 83 S. Ct. 1542, 10 ,. Ed. 2d 693; In a civil action, Stiltner v. Rhay, supra, 322 1". 2d 314, 317 (9 Cir. 1963) ; Cole v. Smith, 344 F. 2d 721, 723 (8 Cir. 1965) ; and in a 1 22155 proceeding, Poster v. United States, 344 F. 2d 6098, 09 (6 Cir. 1065). I have seen no statement to this effect regarding appellate procedure.
There are, however, Intimations that lhnits (1o exist arid that not everything guaranteed by the five cited Supreme Court cases Is applicable on the civil side. The lower federal courts, on occasion, seem purposely to observe and suggest that there is a difference between a criminal case and a civil one. Thus, in King v. Carmichael, 268 P. 2( 305, 306 (6 Cir. 1959), cert. denied 361 U.S. 968, 80 S. Ct. 597, 4 L. Pd. 2d 548, a civil rights case, the court, in considering the Issue of a free transcript, "id, "Ths is not a criminal case," and that the Information sought was otherwise available. In Anderson v. lleinze, 258 P. 2d 479, 481 (9 Cir. 1958), cert. denied 358 U.S. 889, 79 S. Ct. 131, 3 1,. D. 2d 110, a federal habeas proceeding by a state prisoner, the court observed, in passing upon the Issue of right to counsel, that the appeal "is not a step In a federal criminal proceeding, but is a step In a federal civil proceeding," and held that the Sixth Amendment has no application and that the rule of the Johnson case was not controlling. The court went on, however, meticulously to consider the Isue in the light, instead, of the due process clause. In a series of four 12255 cases, the Eighth Circuit has drawn the same distinction between criminal and civil and has observed, "Surely, no court is required to grant leave to a defendant to appeal in forma pauperis where it Is obvious that ths appeal Is doomed to futility. Oershon v. United States, 243 F.2d 527, 530 (8 Cir. 1957), cert. denied 355 U.S. 873, 7885. Ct. 124, 2 PAdL. 12d 78; 11111 v. Settle, 244 F. 2d 311, 312 (8'Cir. 1957) ; Young v. United States, 246 F. 2d 901, 902 (8 Cir. 1957), cert. denied 355 U.S. 917, 78 .. Ct. 348, 2 L. I. 2d 277, where it refused a cost-free record "in cases which are without merit anld doomed from their inception"; Taylor v. United States, 308 F. 2d 770, 779 (8 Cir. 1062). These four cases were requests for In forma pauperis procedure generally but Young Involved, as well, a specific request for a free record.
The First Circuit similarly has flatly held that the requirement of Coppcdge that counsel be appointed In a direct criminal appeal does not apply In a 1 2255 case. Fleming v. United States, 365 P. 2d 587, 588, footnote (1 Cir. 1M.). This

was Inherent in earlier First Circuit 1 225.5 cases, Joyce v. United States, 327 F. 2d 531 (1 Cir. 191) : Suarez v.United States, 328 F. 2d 473, 474 (1 Cir. 1904), and ini a case of questionable ancestry, Keenan v. Mcrath, 328 F. 2d 610, 611 (1 Or. 161), even though these cases lid not make speclfic reference to Coppedge
or its companions. Thus, One can find clear expressions in the cases that the in forma paupers
standards which the Supreme Court has evolved for direct criminal appeals, do have positive application to pure civil cases and to the hybrid habeas and § 22.55 ploceedingS, bit one can also find clear expressions to the effect that there is a significant distinction between a criminffal case and a civil one and that these direct appeal standards are not fully applicable to civil proceedings.
I suspect that this difference is more apparent than real. I believe that on analysis-which in the long run may or may not prove sound-the free expressions of full appllcation on the itelvsiidle have appeared in those cases in which the apptlicant merely seeks in form I uperis relief generally. Presumably, lie already has counsel or is willing to lie his own coti.sel and presumably there Is no burning question about a transcript.- It Is in cases where a specific request for appointed counsel is iade, or where there is a request for a transcript at governnient expense, that IhN courts have been hesitant. As is .o often fle case, It is easier to be free with announcement of basie principles and their application where relief flows easily; it is harder to lie that free when a lawyer's thie, with-
out comlieusation,or government costs are conseqtlences. Perhaps the Eighth Cir.
cult cases are not so easily separated into the two categorle.. One dafthe Supreme Court will tell us whether the direct appeal requlrenietits
do have full application on the cvi side. In the meantime, the EightliCiriiIt, and certainly the First, and perhals the Ninth, have stopped shori of unlimited ap-
plication. Tius far, the process has been a selective one. So fu- as I can tell, this has not resulted litinjustice.
go much for § 1915, the general in forma pxuperis statute.
II. 1abeas corpus. The great writ. of course, is guaranteed Ioy the ('onstitution. Article 1,1 9.
clause 2, and li federal courts by Chaliter 1534of the present judicial code, 28 U.S.C. 0§ 2241-2255. But. as you know, § 2255, by its terms. severely limits the availability of the writ for federal prisoners. If a federal prisoner has a remedy under § 2255. that is the route lie must follow. Weber v. Settle. 1,,5F.2d 799, S0 OS Cir. 1950) Smith v. Settle, .34#2 F. 2d 142 (8 ir. 1902) ; Hlaynes v. Harris, 344 F.2d 463, IC6 (8 Cir. 19(15) - Cagle v. ('iccone. 360 F.2d 1,83. 1." (S Cir. 1906). As
a practical consequence, therefore, federal haibeas corpus is important for us
primarily with respect to state prisoners. It reads:
28R U.S.C. 1 2253. Appeal In a habeas corpus orocedlugii 1'!-fre a -;rciiot r district judge. the final
order shall lie subject to review, on apqi, 1i.4
Al appeal may not be taken to ,he court of appeals from the final ordet in
a halas corpus proceeding where the detention complained of arises oixt of process Issued by a Slate court, unless the jusTice or judge who rendered the order or a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of probable cause. Here, we obviously have a standard. lut is Is a standard of probable cause.
And a certificate of probable cause Is a requisite to an appeal. Madison v. Taliash, 3.59 P.2d 60, 61 (S ir. I9CA) ; Curtis v. Pennet, 351 F.2d 931. 933 (8 Cir. 19065).
One should Initially observe that this probable cause retirement of § 2253
at least does not have the eqw-l protection difficultles. which have emerged as to paupers' appeals in general. The probable caus- certilfcate of § 2253 Is required of both the Indigent and the nonIlndigent.
One may initially observe, also, that Voiakaoirski lid not go so far as to say that a certificate of prolabhle cause should be routinely ied in all cases. It merely held that when the district court issued tie certificate the appellate court must indulge in it full review. Nowakomski leaves open ihe basie question of issuance or nonissuance. If any case were to hold that a certificate should routinely Issue, we could all agree that the appellate paragraph of § 22-53 would
thereby he reduced to nothing more than a procelural formality, and a rather useless one at that.
But what is probable cause? Does is equate with the standards of "good falth" and "frivolous or malicious,"' which are present In § 1915?
As i perhaps to be expected. one fliid. varying expre.sions in tie cas"s. Sonuf seem to aiply an Interpretation of "without merit, and therefore, frivolous." Nolan v. Nash, 310 F.2d 776 (8 Cir. 1903), cert. denied 375 U.S. C'24, 84 S.Ct. 269,

68

11 L.l-d.2d 160; Nally v. Scott, 114 F.2d 562 (8 Cir. 1910) ; Simpson v. Teets, 248

1'.2d 245, 250 (1966). In other decisions probable cause seems to be related to

a lack of substance. Chessman v. i)lckson, 275 F.2d 604, "0 (9 Cir. 1960) ("any

substance at all"); Gay v. Graham, 269 F.2d 4S2, 487 (10 Cir. 1959) ("no

substantial question") ; United States ex rel. Stewart v.ltagen. 231 F.241 312, 313

(7 Cir. 1956) ("some substantial question worthy of consideration") ; ex Iparte

Farrell, 189 I.2d 540, 513 (1 Cir. 1951), cert. denied Farrell v. O'Brien, 342 U.S.

839, 72 S.(t. 6, 96 I.d. 634 ("unsubstantial, or clearly without merit");

Knuppe v. I.inson, 146 F.Supp. 731, 733 (S.1). Iowa 1956) ("substantial ques-

tion for review"). In a recent district court decision, this distinction was em-

phasized ; it was there notcd tlhat the statute does not define probaible cause but

that, generally, this is "something more than a frivolous assertion * * * hut

something less thall the imperatives of 29 i.S.C. 1 1292," which, as you recall,

in subsection fb), provides for an "subtantlal ground for difference

1965).

If there is a difference In these expressions' I suspect that it is of no significance.

Ii most of these cases relief is denied. Certainly, if a matter Is frivolous, it Is

clearly without l)robable cause. Thus, the cases which speak of frivolity, such as

those from our own circuit, would arrive at the same conclusion on a more sub-

stantive standard.

My own reaction is that the cases, taken as a whole, do indicate that the stand-

ard of probable cause requires something more than the absence of frivolity and

Xotrakowski Itself, I think, suggests that this Is inherently so when It requires full dress treatment by tie court of appeals once the district court has issued a certificate of probable cause.
All thi4 add.s up, in my mind, to the conclusions that there is something definitely to be gained by having the district court, in the first Instance, give very careful consideration to the question whether the state prisoner federal halas applicant has something of substance going for him, and that there is something deftnitely to be lost when the district court routinely issues a certificate of probable cause without thk,; careful consideration. If the case is legally frivolous the ap-
h)lication ought to lie denied. When the case then comes to the court of appeals, as it inevitably does, that court will take another look at it and. on occasion, might issu e the certificate itself. Tile court, however, under .owakotrskf. does riot have this discretion if the district court has Issued the certificate. If an appellate judge issues the certificate where a district Judge has denied it, that should not be regarded by the district judge as a rebuff. It does mean that the appellate
Judge entertains,some doubt. That is his problem. All this, after all, ts.kes us right back to the philo.szophy that this, as with all
other matters, is an i,,-ue for decision by the court of general jurisdiction, the district judge, in the first instance. This. I think, for reasons which are obvious to all of us, is where the best considered and Important decision is to be made. This Is the normal situation, for the routine case the district judge Is there to decide and not to bypass the responsibility of decision. This is the dignified thing for hill) to do. This Is the approach, I submit, which for so long was so forcefully
preseited and believed In by Judges Sanborn and Oardner and others of the Iighth ('ireult. In Ifiggins v. Steele, supra. 15 F1.241 306, 369, a federal lriktier habeas corpus case decided in 1952, a long time ago so far as this area of the criminal law is concerned, Judge John It. Sanborn said :
"Although no district Judge likes to pass ul11on the correctness, of his own decisions, It Is his duty, If lie Is thoroughly convinced that there is no substantial
(ut-tion for review and that an ais'al will be futile, to certify that the appeal sought to ti taken in forma isuiperis is iot taken in good! faith 0 4 We say this not to relieve ourselves of tie burden of reviewing cases which have no merit. but to relieve those who are required to resist such appeals of unnecessary trouble
and expense. "We realize that the serious consideration which this Court has given to
appeals in foria l~ulperis in hopeless eass may have led the l)istrict .Judges in this ('ircult to believe thalt suh appeals sh;otld lie allowe.I with extreme libe'rality. We art now of the opinion that much greater care should lie taken in screening such cases, in order to separate those which arm clearly without

merit from those which are meritorious or which at least present some substantial quest ion worthy of consider t ion."
One might ask whether a district court could, with logic, allow an appeal to be taken iti forma pauperls and yet refuse to Issue a certificate of probable cause an(, if so, with what result. One might say that this partial granting and partial denial is Inconsistent. Yet, allowing in forma pauleris procedures may indicate only that the court finds the applicant Is indigent aud is acting in good faith. This may not be inconsistent with a determination of lack of probable cause.
III. Section 2255. Here, as you know, the statute, so far as appeals arc concerned, reads: § 2255. Federal custody; remedies on motion attacking sentence
An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from tie order entered on the motion as from a final Judgment as application for a writ of habeas corpus. * '* On its face, therefore, 1 2255 refers us back to tile habeas corpus situation. However, since tie petitioner is not complaining of detention arising out of
process issued by a state court, the probable cause requirement of the habeas statute § 2253 has no application. Thius for the in forain pauperis § 2255 appeal, the only limitation is that of 11915 centering li "good faith". All that Ne have said before as to this statute presumably apflies here.
Thus, If there Is a distinction between "probable cause" (§ 2253) and "good faith" (§ 1915), a § 22.55 matter rests on the lower standard of mere good faith.
The Eighth Circuit, contrary perhaps to the Impression of some of you, does miot routinely override, in a - 2255 case, a district -court's certificate that an appeal Is not taken in gool falth. See Taylor v. United States, 308 F.2d 770 (8 Cir. 1962) ; Franano v. United States, 303 F.2d 470 (8 Cir. 1962), cet denied 371 U.S. W05, 3 S.Ct. 125, 9 L1.Ed.2d 102; Turner v. United States, 325 P.2d 988 (8 Cir. 1964), cert denied 377 U.S. 916. 84 S.Ct. 1354, 12 L.Ed.241 308; Peckhamn v. United States (August 1967) (unreported). Franano, incidentally, was a paid appeal and yet was dismissed on the ground of frivolity. And Turner paid his dacket fee because lie felt lie might thereby avoid a denial for frivolity; he was unsuccessful. Even in a recent.direct appeal, despite the holding in (Coppcdge, Chlef Judge Vogel and 1, presently constituting what we call the administrative panel, recently denied in forma piauperis procedure in Misc. No. 476, Bishop v. United States, where the complaint was a general and non-specific one(directed to claimed instructional error.
There is a recent First Circuit case which may be of some interest. lialliday v. United States, 3S* F.2d 270 (1 Cir. 1967). This was a § 2255 proceeding which challenged the voluntarlness of pleas of guilty originally accepted without appro-
priate inquiry under crinilial Rule 11. The First Circuit held that it was not proper for the same district Judge to take new evidence and review the correctness, of his own determination. Chief Judge Aldrich recognized that there are cases which look the other way. lie stated that the court reached its conclusion, not from any feeling of constitutional compulsion, "but from a conviction that the best practice dictates such a policy". lie observed that this (lid not mean that a sentencing judge canot review a § 2255 petition to conclude. if appropriate, that no evidentiary hearing is required. lle recognized that the ruling could entail coinplications in a one judge district. One can also envision complications if tho e-'e Is to It- follow-edl iii a multiple Judge district.
I'. Section 753(f). Judge Hleaney has suggested that a comment about cost-free transcripts would be in order. Here two statutes are pertinent. The first is § 1915(b). mentioned above, which provides that in any civil or criminal case the court nay "direct that the expense of printing the record on appeal, if such printing is required by the appellate court, be pail hy the United States". This. of course, seems to relate to printing as such. lut often printing the record first requires a typed transcript of oral testimony. The second is the Court Relprter Act, 28 U.S.C. j 753(f). As last aniended in 1965, this provides In part:
28 U.S.C. § 753. Reporters
(f) • * • Fees for transcrips furnished in criminal or habeas corpUq
proceedings to persons allowed to sue, defend. or appeal It forma paupers shall be pald by the United States out of money appropriated for that pur-
wIsse. Fees for transcripts furnished in proceedings brought unler section

70
2255 of this title to persons permitted to sue or appeal In forma paupers shall be pald by the United States out of money appropriated for that lourlose If the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the sult or appeal is riot frivolous and that the transcrlpt Is needed to decide the Issue preseited by the stilt or aplal. Fees for transcripts furnished in other proceedIngs to persons permitted to appeal linform pauperis shall also be pald by the
United States If the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal Is not frivolous (hut presents a substantial question). * * * Section 753(f) obviously separntes the cases Into three categories:
I. Criminal or habeas corpus porocecdings. 2. Section 2255 proceedings. 3. Other proceedings. As to criminal or habeas corpus proceedings the statute merely says that transcript fees shall be laid by the United States out of money appropriated for that purpose. No condition Is imposed. For a § 2255 proceeling a fee for a transcript shall e pald by the United States only on condition. That condition is that the trial judge or a circuit judge certify both that the stilt or appeal Is not frivolous and that the transcript isneeded for decislMn. Here we need a certification of no frivolity and oif necessity. This smacks partially of § 1915(d)'s reference to frivolity bit does riot scene to relate to the good faith of § 1915(a), or to the probable cause of 1 2253. Perhaps tile statute is clear enough. For "other proceedlngs" a transcript fee shall be pald by the United States again only on condition. This time the condition is that the appeal is not frivolous but presents a substantial question and. for what signileanee, if any, It may have. lie latter phrase Is in parentheses. Thu., to repeat, for §12255, we need a certificate as to nion-frivolity and nece,,Ity. For "other proceedings" we need a cerlifieate as to non-frivolity and,
parenthetically, as to substantialness. Why (10 we have these distinctions in the statute? Are they merely careless draftsmanship. or the product. so often confusing, of amendment or compromise during the legislative proCe5,. or are the differences Intentional and of significance?
One sidelight is perhaps of Interest. Section 753(f) was amended in 1965 in order to provide cost-free transcripts for use in § 2255 proceedings. Prior thereto. such transcripts were riot authorized. Mr. Itamsey ('lark, then )eputy Attorney General. wrote tile Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary on May 27. 1965. recommending the amendment. lie suggested that the Committee give consideration to the fact that, illa habeas corpus matter. there is no reqiirement for certification that the proceeding is riot frivolous an( the transcr1pt Isneeded. lie sald. "Tile reason for this distinction is not apparent If the motion remedy under section 2255 Is to Ie, a reniedy commensurate with a writ of halocas corpus". 2 U.S. ('ode Cong. & Ad. News. 89th Cong.. 1 se.s. 1965. pp. 2920-2921. The Committee apparently did niot give iuch consideration to the distinction.
In one district court civil case the judge observed that lie had no diffmeulty in determining that the appeal was not frivolous but that It,dh( have difficulty in determining whether it presented a sflostintial questioni. lie then related substatnte to something "reasomialdy dtlhatahle" on a purely objective standard. Ortiz v. greyhoundd Corp., 192 F. Suipp. IK3. 905 !).Md. 1959). Actually, he coltditioned his relief by requiring thai the expense to the government be taxed as costs hI the case and ultimately recovered from the party found to ie liable. This condition, as a practical matter. probably di1 not work out for the defendant ultimately prevailed on a judgment n.o.v. Ortiz v. (reyhound Corp., 275 F. 2d 770 (4 Cir 1960).
Of possible signifleance is the Fotrth Circuit's decision in Uniled States v. Shoaf. 311 F. 2d A32 (4 Cir. 1961), issued prior to the 1965' amendment of § 753(f). "'hliwlas a * 2255 prmceeding where the ipetitioner requested free transcripts of two trials. Judge 1laynsworth observed that "the right to a transcript at governmhent eXK',nse arises only i response to nel of it" ; that need on a direct appeal with niew appellate counsel is a situation different front collateral attack where "mo-st of the trial errors warranting attention inl direct aplocals ar, not reviewable": that it is rare where the defendant needs a transcript "to become aware of the events or occurrences which constitute a ground for collateral attack"; anad that the Supreme Court has not yet gone so far as to require the furnishing of a transcript to a § 2255 indigent applicant "who has undertaken to show neither specific nor general need" for it.

A special question, and this is the one Judge lieaney is Interested in, is whether a court has the power to order a transcript at governnwnt expense before it allows
an appeal in forma pauperls. Tle cases are few. Whitt v. United States, 101 U.S. App. ).C. 1, 259 1'. 2d 158
(195), cert. denied 3.59 U.S. 937, 79 .. Ct. (152, 3 ,. ld. 2d 637, concerned a direct crhninal fapial. Judge Washington, fit writing for the court, held that 1 753(f) gives the trial court and the court of apials authority to direct the preparation of a transcript at government exilense lrior to the allowance of in forina paupers appellate relief, lie went on to ob.erve, however, that a petitloner is not entitled to a transcript as of right. Judges Fahy and llazelon, who sat with him, fit concurrence added that the ordering of a transcript at government expense "is anl essential Incident to our power to allow appeals in forain pauperis". 'his meant, I suppose, that they felt they did not have to be concerned with § 7,53(f).
As noted, Whit was a direct aplal. Its holding, applicable to such ani aplcal and to a ibeas matter, ilay seem clear enough mlder I 753(f). But what of a 12255 iroeceding? l1'hitl, as to this, is not strictly ll point for it rests on that lxtrt of I 753(f) which is not conditioned by non-frivolIly and ilece zsity. Call frivolity and necesity usually Ie determined by tie very nature of the issues raised so that a transcrilpt is not necessary, within tle requirement of the statute? And if a judge certifies that an aplpeal is not frivolous iniorder to get a transcript, Is lie thereby determining non-frivolity for all purl ses, that is, for purposes of allowing the in forma Islnperis § 2"255 appeal which, you recall, relates back to § 1915 mid its standard of good faith? ,iullge L.earned land noted this dilemma when lie said, "We are of course aware that a thorough decision whether there was a substaltial question would depend u11)1 a scrutiny of tile wholp record; so that, speaking literally, we could not adequately decide tile motlo0f titil after we had granted It." Jaffe v. United States, 240 F. 2d 760, 762 (2 Cir. 1957).
Here, again, I suggest that this dileima il most cases may prove to be more aptoarent than real mid that often frivolity and necessity call and will be deterniined to exist or to be absent by tie inherent nature of tile Issues raised, rather than by a review of tile contents of the Itranscript. This is not to say, of course, that, once the appeal has been allowed, a trans(cript iy not be ueeded for pur-
poses of appellate review. All this may be hairs!plitting. Certainly, I personally incline toward the view
that a court does )lave power -to order transcript fees piiad in appropriate situations.
Now, some ixrsonal observations, some by way of apology, some with convietion:
1. The law Ili tills area is still developing. Some aspects of the reach and of the limitations of the statutes are yet to le leternined.
2. -Some of the older eases, o both thie trial and appellate levels, are perhaps of questionable precedent today and should le employed gingerly antd with caution.
3. All through this area-in tile Statutes themselves , as you have seen, and cerainly in the published opinions-are words which .eem to be phrases of art. "'Probable cause," "good faith," and "frivolous," are tie primary ones. )o these have like or significantly different meanings andi do they imply tle presence of like or different standards for judilifal action? Certainly, all rf theil are ied with respect to issues which are fundamen tally similar.
4. We niust appreciate the practical as;IK't, Judicial attitudes change. Court
personnel change., We progress, we hoioe. In legal and even in constitutional interiretation. As in medicine, with which I amil somewhat familiar. so lit law. although more slowly, there is constant movement. We should loe aware of this, anticipate it, and(] not resent It. We would not wish the situation to he otherwise.
5. 1 have worked into all this a good lit of lily ownil attitude and my own ap-
proach. My judgment may ibe good but it also may lie very had. Certainly. yours is just as reliable as ililne.
However, and for what they tire worth, I end tilts overlong presentation with a series of conclusions, which I stlbinit to you for your consideration:
CONCLUIsONs
1. Our primary and initial concern is not with § 2253 or witi § 2255 but with the in forma loauperis statute § 1915. This Is the statute which sets tile tole.
2. Section 1915 is broad and comprehensive il terms and in application. It is not restricted to criminal matters or to habeas or to § 2255 proceedings.

3. 'The concept that in forma pauperis procedure Is a privilege, rather than a

right, I. perhaps somewhat suspect today, despite continuing lip service to it.

In one sense, it may be a privilege, but the sovereign has chosen to grant It and it

thereby as umes certain characteristics of a right.

4. Still, the procedure at least on the statute's face, is within the area of discreIIon. A federal court "may authorize" tIlperocedure.

5. In a direct appeal from a criminal conviction the indigent is to have the

Same rights of review posed

y the non-inidigent. This ieatis couti.sel who Is

art adv(Kate. This nteans only ant issue which Is not plainly frivol6us. This means only an argument which is rational. This does not mean any particular degree

of probability of success.

G. On a direct apiwxtl from a criminal conviction there remains only a very

little elbow room, despite the good faith requirement of I 1915(a). for denial of

in formal pauplris appellate procedure. This i a practical fact which,as practical

Judges. we nri,lrsetcognize. Concededly. [he Eighth Circuit has not Indulged lit

the practice of specially preening non-indigent appealR from convictions in order

to ascertain frivolity prior to fuDlhlearing on the merits. It follows that it is not

er -sible to do this on indigent appeals.

7. Whether. in a civil case, the in formal pauujwris standards for direct criminal

appeals are to ai+ply is as yet unsettled. Tl e Supreme Court has not spoken. Tilere

is authority that the standards are fully applicable itcnivil cases. There is athority, where specifle relief - r; lested, that there are limitations. The trend,

I SuSpect, is toward full application. I also Suspect, however. that complete Justice

can be effected on a eas-e-by-case approach.

8. If, in a state prisoner's federal hnleas corpus proeeding, a district Judge

grants a vertifleate of probable cau-e, the court of appeals must review "with its

ordinary procedure." Noa,'akowki.

9. No uniformly accepted definition of probable cause has as yet evolved. A standard higher than "good faith" seems to lie implied. Some decisions, in denying

relief, speak of frivolity. This apivirent difference, however, is not Important and it is understandable. If a ca. Isfrivolous. it certainly lacks probable cause. It

seems reasonable to conclude that the standard of ; 2253 demands something of

possible substance before the applicant is legally entitled to his certitleate. 10. This being so, a district Judge should not routinely issue the certificate in

every case. Ills is the first and primary deelsiov to lie made. The right of appeal

has been known to be abused. If he feels that no probable cause exists, it is his

responsibility and his dluty to deny the certificate.

11. The appelate judge has corresponding responsibility not routinely to issue the certificate litevery case, even though, when issued, the appeal may still be

dlismitsed for frivolity under civil Rule 75(g) or perhaps under I 1915(d).

12. in a 2'255 appeal In form pauperis, the applicable standard is4 that

inherent in § 1915, namely. "good faith". This may be a standard lower than prob-

able cause. But. as a practical matter, is it?

13. A judge, district or apliellate. does have tie power to order a transcript,

or a Irtial one, at government expense, not only after an appeal has been

allowed, but also before such allowance in order to enable hin to pass upon the

existence of grounds for appeal, slecifled by the statute, for the particular type of proceeding.

1-1A. judge, however, should exercise this power realistically and not incur this

exemuse for the government if lie can determine the "atisfaction or non-satisfac-

tion of (he statutory standard from another source as. for example tie motion

lpapers themselves. 15. Iet u., in this entire area, until the Supreme Court instructs us otlmlerise,

be willing to act as responsible judges, to evaluate each ease, and to make a

considered judgment. If we are reversed occasionally, what does it matter?

Our professional slisfaction lies in a job performed responsibly and not in

avoiding responsibility.

Sen ator M"',CC'L ,L.. Senactor Mafhi as? Senator-MATIIJAs. Thik iyMour,. Chairman. ,Judge Blaeklun, I a4'c been a member of Several legislative bodies, participated in a great many hearings, heam-d a lot of witnesses.
I must say to Vo11, sir, (hat (10 not believe that I have heard testimot- that I think ISm-ore poignant or more revealinig of a man's eharlcter than YoIur testimony before this committee today.

I think the way in which you introduced us into your own family circle andrevealed your understanlding of the 11100dof young people through your in(lestlanding of your own daughters, the confidence ill the youth of America which you e.jpresse(l, as you expressed confidence in your own daughters, were all very relevant, very inportant. I think that. your testimony here amply justifies the statement which appears on page 3 of the rej)6rt of the Standing Committee on Federal ,liJdieoiry of the American Bar Association, which refers to your opinions as having been wi'Wften "with a consciousness of broad social policies involved and with a perception of current trends of the law."
Mir. Chairman, I would like to refer at. this time to the Justice Dei)artiient's letter of April 15 addressed to the chairman of the committee, where on page 12 in reference to possible conflkt of interest problems the statement is made that. "the underlying question uider the canons is whether Judge Blackmun either acted witi partiality or created the appearance of ptifliilty in the above-entitled cases."
I think perhaps the I)epairtment without being inaccurate has stated the problem of conflict of interest a little obtuselv. T think there, is the further question of personal sensitivity of a judge to the questionls of conflict of interest. And in weithing this question in my own mind I not only consider what Judge Blackimn has said in this committee today lt I refer to the Department of .Justice letter of April 28 where on )age 2 and at other places in the same letter the Deputy Attorney General says:
"Judge Blacktiiihas alled t my attention .... In my personal conversation wi-th Judge Blackmun prior to this hearing I had the same experience, that it was iiot I who had to dig but Judge Blackmun who volunteered the information which might he pIertinent to this particular subject. Tile concept of judicial elhics has progressed in the country and Judlge Blackmun was sensitive enough to the progress so thai in the Gateway case lie did disqualify himself notwithstanding his previous convei'ations with the chief juii(ge of his circuit. All of this is very reassuring and when we come down to the test as it has been described in the American Bar Asociation's informal decision of October 22, 1962, in which it was concluded that "ill the final analysis it nuist be left. to the good ill(lginent and conscience of the individual judge," when we come. to that test I have a great (leal of personal conlhlence that. Judge Blackmun knows what tle test isal(l how to-al)ply it. Judge, as Senator Hart, suggested this morning, in the interest of being fair in conducting these,hearings we must apply the same stanlArds and tests to all tile nominees who come before'us. One of these questions which has been raised in the pmast of previous nomlninees is a question of "batting average," or in general terms, tile way your opinions have survived tile test of appeal. )o -ou have any statistics at all on that subject ? Judge BL.CK.IMtU.N. First of all, Senator Mathias, thank you for
your comments. T have not kept score. I like to think tlat when we are right usually
certiorari is not granted, and so it (toes not enter into the batting average ill the Supreme Court Imilding.
I have, of course, een reversed a number of times, often by a divided court, and I have been affirmed with that unsatsfactory

result. of being right for the wrong reason, which liappens, I suppose,
to all of us.
Senator MA ITi4,.Even here, .Judge Blackniun. Judge ,c.Kli'u,. I wolhl aisstime that I had beeln reversed more times in those cases where certiorari has been grantedthan I have
been aflirnied. I take comfort only in the fact that. I thiik certiorari is granted
when the case is of a sensitive and pIartioular nature or where there is a conflict among the circuits. I am not bothered by it, because I have, as [ stated before, no apology whatsoever to make for the decision that has been made, even though we are proved wrong by the
Supreme Courl. I know of instances where we have been affirmed. I know of in-
stances where we have been reversed. Senator MATIIIAS. I think my (listingllished colleague on my right,
Judge Cook, Senator Cook, is exactly correct when he says that your
presence here in this hearing marks a4historic point in the history of the Supreme Court. I think this day has hlielpled to define il better terms than we ourselves have been able to express the kild of standards for which we have been groping and which we believe the country wanted. I )ersonally feel, ,Judge Blackmn, that. you meet. that stai(lar(ld, that we have set. a new bench mark for the lIenel, and it will be my privilege to support your nomination.
The CHAIRMAN. Senator McClellan ?
Senator McCI,:LtN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This morning I did not. ask any questions. In t'he course of the examination of the nonitnee today it occurred to tie I would like to ask one question, if I may be indulged.
The 10th amendment of tile Constitution with which we are all familitar )rovides that. the powers not delegated to tile TIlnited States by the Constitution or prohibited by it to the States are reserved in the States respectively or in tile people. That. is a part of this document, this great Constfittion of ollrs. and I have the feeling, and T know many others (o, that sometimes that article of the Constitution, or that aniendlment to tile Constitution is either ignored or forgotten. I would like to ask if in the examination of a constitutional issue that may be pending before the Court. if you find the powers attempted to be invoked have in fact not been delegated to tie Federal Government. bv tile Constitution. (10 you believe that the Supreme Court has either the dulty or the right to usurp, attempt. to confer oraPl)llv such
powers )y court (leeision or edict which would have the effect of or be tantalollnt to amending tile Constitution of the Uhnited States?
Judge 13,.cKUN. Senator McClellan. the answer to that is definitely in the negative, of course.
Senator McCtxut.%-. Well, I believe one who takes the oath to Uilhold and support the Constitution has to answer ill the negative. I (1o not believe there is the right or the duty or that a pract ice can be tolerated of tile Supreme Court SuI)plyiug aldelegation of power to tle Feoderal Government which the Constitution as written does not, confer. f (to not believe that it is a document of such elasticity that it should be stretched by any kind of a process of logic or illogic simply to adopt it so as to ineet'any situation which may arise, however desirable the remedy may be. The Constitution provides how it. shiall be amended,

75
and it does not delegate to the Cmrt the power to amend it. And I think it. is important, in this time, iv' these changing times when there arc many who are taking the attitiuk, they do not have time to amend the Constitution, so we should let the Court place an interpretation on it. that will meet. the situation. 'That kind of an expediency is dangerous, dangerous to the prese nationn of constitfitional governmeit. And I am glad to have your auswur in the negative.
Thiaik you. The CirmRm.-. This will close the hearings. There will be an executive session of tle committee.
Judge BLACK.rU.N. Mr. Chairman, may J express my appreciation for the kindness of the committee. Tis is 11t.ime in one's life when
lie is entirely stripped of his actions for the past 61 years. You have been very kind and attentive and I am grateful to each and all of you, and pairticularly to you, Mr. Chairman.
The CHIn .. Thank you, sir. (Whereupon, at 3:45 p.m., the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee adjourned, to reconvene subject to the call of the Chair.) (Material made a part of the record by the Chairman follows:)
