Gosh, Chairman Leahy, thank you for giving me that opportunity. That is a wonderful opportunity.My parents, of course, were—they were loving, wonderful parents, but they were also people who worked hard for their communities, and I think that is what I most took away from them, is the value of serving the communities that you live in and serving other people. And I guess I got a little bit from each side. My father, I said, was a lawyer. He was a lawyer for ordinary people. He was the kind of lawyer who, if you needed a will drawn up, he would draw up your will, and if you had problems on your taxes, he would help you with that. And then one of the things that he did quite a lot of was he helped tenants in New York City. The neighborhood we lived in was in the process of some change as I was growing up, and many people were sort of being forced out of their homes. And he made it really part of his legal work to ensure that either they could stay in their homes, or at least if they did need to move to another neighborhood, they could take something with them to establish a good life there.And he was also a person who spent an enormous amount of time thinking about that neighborhood. He was involved in lots of community boards and citizen groups of various kinds, thinking about environmental projects and land use projects. He really treated that neighborhood of New York City as just—you know, he just so much cared about the welfare of it and poured his heart and soul into trying to improve it.And I think what I learned from him was just the value of public service, was just the value of doing what you can in your neighborhood or in your Nation or wherever you can find that opportunity to help other people and to serve the Nation. So that is what I most took away from my father.My mother was—I said yesterday she was a kind of legendary teacher. She died only a couple of years ago, and my brothers and I, we expected a small funeral. We expected not very many people to attend. I do not have a large family. And instead, just tons and tons of people showed up, and we could not figure out who they all were. And it turned out that these people, who were then middleaged, you know, 30-year-olds, 40-year-olds, whatever, they had had my mother as a sixth grade teacher decades ago, and they were people who just wanted to come and pay their respects because— they kept on coming up to me and my brothers and saying, ‘‘At the age of 12, your mother taught me that I could do anything.’’ And she was really demanding. She was a really tough teacher. You know, it was not—you did not slide by in Mrs. Kagan’s class. But she got the most out of people, and she changed people’s lives because of that.And if I look at my own career in this kind of strange way, not planned but in the sort of strange way, I think, you know, part of my life is my father and part of my life is my mother, that part of my life has been in public service. I have been really blessed with the opportunities I have had to work in Government and to serve this Nation. And then part of my life is teaching, which I take enormous pleasure and joy from. I am looking over your right shoulder—your left shoulder, right on my side, and there is a stu-dent of mine right there. And maybe there are some other students that are around the room. And it is a kind of great thing.

Well, Chairman Leahy, the Framers were incredibly wise men, and if we always remember that, we will do pretty well, because part of their wisdom was that they wrote a Constitution for the ages. And this was very much in their mind. This was part of their consciousness. You know, even that phrase that I quoted yesterday from the Preamble of the Constitution, I said the Constitution was ‘‘to secure blessings of liberty.’’ I did not quote the next part of that phrase. It said ‘‘blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity.’’ So they were looking toward the future. They were looking generations and generations and generations ahead and knowing that they were writing a Constitution for all that period of time, and that circumstances and that the world would change, just as it had changed in their own lives very dramatically. So they knew all about change. And they wrote a Constitution, I think, that has all kinds of provisions in it, so there are some that are very specific provisions. It just says what you are supposed to do and how things are supposed to work. So it says to be a Senator, you have to be 30 years old, and that just means you have to be 30 years old. And it does not matter if people mature earlier, and it does not matter if people’s life spans change. You just have to be 30 years old because that is what they wrote and that is what they meant and that is what we should do. But there are a range of other kinds of provisions in the Constitution of a much more general kind, and those provisions were meant to be interpreted over time, to be applied to new situations and new factual contexts. So the Fourth Amendment is a great example of this. It says, ‘‘There shall be no unreasonable searches and seizures.’’ Well, what is unreasonable? That is a question. The Framers could have given like a whole primer on police practices, you know, which searches were reasonable and whichsearches were not reasonable and lots of different rules for saying that. But they did not do that. And I think that they did not do that because of this incredible wisdom that they had that they knew that the world was going to change and that—you know, they did not live with bomb-sniffing dogs and with heat-detecting devices.

And companies and all these questions that judges, courts, everybody is struggling with—police—in the Fourth Amendment context. And I think that they laid down—sometimes they laid down very specific rules. Sometimes they laid down broad principles. Either way we apply what they say, what they meant to do. So in that sense, we are all originalists. 

Many times. [Laughter.] 

And you know what? They have been read to me many times, too. [Laughter.] 

Senator Leahy, before I answer that question, may I say a little bit more about what you started with about constitutional changes? 

Just to show my commitment to being open. All right? 

But you said something which just sort of triggered a thought in me, and I just wanted to—as you said, there are all these many changes that have happened to the Constitution, and I think it is important to realize that those changes do come in sort of two varieties. One is the formal amendment process, and I thinkit was Senator Cornyn yesterday who talked about the formal amendment process, and that is tremendously important.So, you know, when Thurgood Marshall said that this was a defective Constitution, you know, he was talking about the fact that this was a Constitution that counted slaves as three-fifths of a human being, that did not do anything about that original sin of our country. And the 14th amendment changed that. The 14th Amendment was an enormous break after the Civil War, and it created a different Constitution for America. So partly the changes come in that way.But partly they come outside the formal amendment process as well, and what you said about Plessy and Brown is absolutely right, that if you look at the specific intent of the drafters of the 14th Amendment, they thought that the 14th Amendment was perfectly consistent with segregated schools. I mean, you just have to—you cannot really argue otherwise as a historical matter. But in Brown, the Court said otherwise, and, you know, step by step by step, decision by decision, in large part because of what Justice Marshall did, you know, we got to a place where the Court said it is inconsistent with the principle of equal protection of the laws that the drafters of the 14th Amendment laid down. It is inconsistent with that principle to have segregated schools. So that is a way in which change can happen as well.Now, to go to your real question—and I apologize for that digression. I have looked at that book review many times and been pointed to it, and here is what I think: I still think that the basic points of that book review were right, and the basic points were that the Senate has a very significant role to play in picking Supreme Court Justices, that is important who serves on the Supreme Court, that everybody should treat it as important, and that the Senate should—has a constitutional responsibility and should take that constitutional responsibility seriously, and also that it should have the information it needs to take that responsibility seriously, and part of that is getting some sense, some feel of how a nominee approaches legal issues, the way they think about the law, and I guess that is my excuse for giving you a little bit more even than you wanted about constitutional change. But I would say that there are limits on that.Now, some of the limits I talked about in that article itself. I mean, that article makes very clear that it would be inappropriate for a nominee to talk about how she will rule on pending cases or on cases beyond that that might come before the Court in the future. So the article was very clear about that line.Now, when I came before this Committee in my SG hearing, Senator Hatch and I had some conversation because Senator Hatch said to me—and I am sorry he is not here. He said to me he thought that I had the balance a little bit off. He said, you know, in addition—he basically said it is not just that people can ask you about cases that come before the Court; they can ask you a range of questions that are a little bit more veiled than that, but they are really getting at the same thing. And if it is not right to say how you would rule on a case that is going to come before the Court, or that might, then it is also not right to ask those kinds of ques-tions, which essentially ask you the same thing without doing so in so many words.And I went back and forth a little bit with Senator Hatch, both in these hearings and on paper, and I basically said to Senator Hatch that he was right, that I thought that I did have the balance a little bit off and that I skewed it too much toward saying that answering is appropriate even when it would, you know, provide some kind of hints. And I think that that was wrong. I think that in particular it would not be appropriate for me to talk about what I think about past cases, you know, to grade cases, because those cases themselves might again come before the Court.

Senator Leahy, I think certainly as I said in that questionnaire answer that I would recuse myself from any case in which I have been counsel of record at any stage of the proceedings, in which I have signed any kind of brief. And I think that there are probably about ten cases—I have not counted them up particularly, but I think that there are probably about ten cases that are on the docket next year in which that is true, in which I have been counsel of record on a petition for certiorari or some other kind of pleading. So that is a flat rule.In addition to that, I said to you on the questionnaire that I would recuse myself in any case in which I have played any kind of substantial role in the process. I think that that would include— I am going to be a little bit hesitant about this because one of the things I would want to do is talk to my colleagues up there and make sure that this is what they think is appropriate, too. But Ithink that that would include any case in which I have officially formally approved something. So one of the things that the Solicitor General does is approve appeals or approve amicus briefs to be filed in lower courts or approve interventions.

There is no doubt, Senator Leahy. That is binding precedent entitled to all the respect of binding precedent in any case. So that is settled law.

The Solicitor General does not typically take part in policy issues, and certainly—the only policy issues I think that I might have taken part in—and these are policy issues that would only overlap with litigation issues or some national security issues. But, otherwise, you know, the Solicitor General really is a legal officer.

Right. I think that anything that I substantially participated in as a Government official that is coming before the Court, I should take very seriously, as you say, the appropriateness of recusal.

Absolutely, Senator Leahy. I worked for President Bill Clinton, and we tried to implement his policy views and objectives.

Senator Leahy, military recruiters had access to Harvard students every single day I was dean.

I do not believe it did, Senator Leahy, so I am confident that the military had access to our students and our students had access to the military throughout my entire deanship, and that is incredibly important because the military should have the best and brightest people it can possibly have in its forces. And I think, you know, I said on many, many occasions that this was a great thing for our students to think about doing in their lives, that this is the most important and honorable way any person can serve his or her country.

That was not the case, Senator Leahy. The only question that ever came up, as you stated earlier, this was a balance for the law school because, on the one hand, we wanted to make absolutely sure that our students had access to the military at all times, but we did have a very longstanding—going back to the 1970s—anti-discrimination policy which said that no employer could use the Office of Career Services if that employer would notsign a non-discrimination pledge that applied to many categories— race and gender and sexual orientation and actually veteran status as well. And the military could not sign that pledge.

Because of the ‘‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’’ policy. 

Well, I said it because I believe it. I was so honored to be invited to West Point. They have a mandatory part of their curriculum that all students take a constitutional law course, and they invite a person each year to talk to the students about any legal subject. And it was really the greatest honor I think I have ever gotten to be asked to be that person. And I went up and I talked to the West Point students and faculty about something that I talked about yesterday, really, which was about the rule of law and about how it applied in the military context. And I was—I love that institution, the faculty and the students there. It was an incredible experience for me. But, you know, in addition, I mean, I tried in every way I could to make clear to the veterans of the military at Harvard Law School and people who were going to go into the military how much I respected their service, how much I thought that they were doing the greatest thing that anybody could do for their country. 

Senator Leahy, this has been a sort of long process, this process, and sometimes an arduous one. I have only cried once during this process, and I cried when I woke up one morning and I read that op-end from Captain Merrill, that it meant just an enormous amount to me. He is a magnificent man doing greatthings for our country, and his praise meant more to me than anybody’s.

Well, Senator Sessions, the Constitution is an enduring document. The Constitution is the Constitution. And the Constitution does not change except by the amendment process. But as I suggested to Chairman Leahy, the Constitution does over time, where courts are asked to think about how it applies to new sets of circumstances, to new problems, the things that the Framers never dreamed of. And in applying the Constitution case by case by case to new circumstances, to changes in the world, the constitutional law that we live under does develop over time. 

I do agree with that, Senator Sessions. That is the point I was trying to make, however inartfully, that you take the Fourth Amendment and you say there is unreasonable searches and seizures, and that provision stays the same unless it is amended. That is the provision. And then the question is: What counts as an unreasonable search and seizure? And new cases come before the Court, and the Court tries to think about, to the extent that one can glean any meaning from the text itself, from the original intent, from the precedents, from the history, from the principles embedded in the precedent, and the Court sort of step by step bystep, one case at a time, figures out what the Fourth—how the Fourth Amendment applies.

Well, Senator Sessions, I am not quite sure how I would characterize my politics. But one thing I do know is that my politics would be, must be, have to be completely separate from my judging. And I agree with you to the extent that you are saying, look, judging is about considering a case that comes before you, the parties that come before you, listening to the arguments they make, reading the briefs they file, and then considering how the law applies to their case—how the law applies to their case, not how your own personal views, not how your own political views might suggest, you know, anything about the case, but what the law says, whether it is the Constitution or whether it is a statute. Now, sometimes that is a hard question, what the law says, and sometimes judges can disagree about that question. But the question is always what the law says. And if it is a constitutional question, it is what the text of the Constitution says, it is what the history says, the structure, precedent, but what the law says, not what a judge’s personal views—— 

Senator Sessions, it is absolutely the case that I have served in two democratic administrations, and I think—— 

Senator Sessions, I honestly do not know what that label means. I have worked in two Democratic administrations. Senator Graham suggested yesterday—and I think he is right— that you can tell something about me and my political views from that. But as I suggested to you, my political views are one thing, and the way—— 

I love my good friend Ron Klain, but I guess I think that people should be allowed to label themselves, and that is—you know, I do not know what that label means, and so I guess I am not going to characterize it one way or the other. 

Senator Sessions, the military had full access to our students at all times, both before I became dean and during my—— 

So the history of this is Harvard did have this antidiscrimination principle, and for many, many years, my predecessor, who was Bob Clark, had set up a system to ensure military access, but also to allow Harvard to comply with its anti-discrimination policy, which prohibited the Office of Career Services fromproviding assistance to employers that could not sign the anti-discrimination pledge. And the accommodation that Bob worked out was that the veterans organization would instead sponsor the military recruiters. So the only thing that was at issue was essentially the sponsoring organization, whether it was the Office of Career Services or instead the student veterans organization.

It was the rule when I took office, and it remained the rule after I took office. For many years, DOD, the Department of Defense, had been very——

For a number of years, for a great number of years, the Department of Defense had been very accepting, had approved the accommodation that we had worked out.You are quite right that in 2002 DOD came to the law school and said, ‘‘Although this accommodation has been acceptable to us so far, it is not acceptable any longer, and instead we want the official Office of Career Services assistance.’’

And Dean Clark agreed to do so, and that continued——

I do oppose the ‘‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’’ policy. 

And I did then. 

Senator Sessions, I have repeatedly said that I believe that the ‘‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’’ policy is unwise and unjust. I believed it then and I believe it now. And we were trying to do two things. We were trying to make sure that military recruiters had full and complete access to our students, but we were also trying to protect our own anti-discrimination policy and to protect the students whom it is—whom the policy is supposed to protect, which in this case were our gay and lesbian students. And we tried to do both of those things. 

Senator Sessions, that is not quite correct. The lawsuit itself brought a constitutional challenge to the ‘‘Don’t ask’’— to the Solomon amendment. We did not participate in that challenge. What the brief that I filed did do was to argue, try to argue that Harvard’s accommodation, which allowed—which, you know, welcomed the military on campus, but through our veterans organization, we tried to argue that that accommodation was consistent with the Solomon amendment, and that is what we argued to the Third Circuit.

Senator Sessions, after the Third Circuit ruled the Solomon amendment unconstitutional—and the Third Circuit was the only appellate court to have issued a decision on that question and did rule the Solomon Amendment unconstitutional—I thought it appropriate at that point to go back to what had been the school’s longstanding policy, which had been to welcome the military onto the campus but through the auspices of the veterans organization rather than through the auspices of our Office of Career Services.

Senator Sessions, we were never out of compliance with the law. Nobody ever suggested that Harvard should be sanctioned in any way. The only question was whether Harvard should continue—had continued to remain eligible for Federal funding. And after DOD came to us and after DOD told us that it wanted law schools to essentially ignore the Third Circuit decision, that it wanted—that it was going to take that decision to the Supreme Court and that it wanted law schools to continue to do what theyhad been doing, we did change back. We did precisely what DOD asked us to do, and DOD never withheld——

Senator Sessions, the question was—— 

The Solomon amendment remained in effect, but we had always thought that we were acting in compliance with the Solomon amendment, and for many, many years, DOD agreed with us. After the Third Circuit, I thought it was appropriate to go back to our old policy, which previously DOD had thought complied with the Solomon Amendment. When DOD came to us and said, no, the Third Circuit really has not changed matters because we are going to take this to the Supreme Court and we want law schools really to ignore what the Third Circuit said, DOD and we had some discussions, and we went back to doing it exactly the way DOD wanted to. In the interim—— 

Senator Sessions, if I might, you had suggested that the military lost a recruiting season, but, in fact, the veterans organization did a fabulous job of letting all our students know that the military recruiters were going to be at Harvard during that recruiting season, and military recruiting went up that year, not down. Now, you are exactly right that the Supreme Court did reject our amicus brief. Again, we filed an amicus brief not attacking the constitutionality of the Solomon amendment, but instead saying that essentially the Harvard policy complied with the Solomon amendment. The Supreme Court rejected it 9–0, unanimously. 

Senator Sessions, we had gone back and done exactly what the Department of Defense had asked us to do prior to the time that the Supreme Court ruled. We had done it——

Senator Sessions, Larry Summers and I always worked cooperatively on this policy. I did not ever do anything that he did not know about, and he never did anything that I did not approve of. With respect to the decision that you are talking about, this was a joint decision that Larry and I made that because DOD thought that what we were doing was inappropriate, we should, in fact, reverse what we had done. You know, that period lasted for a period of a few months in my 6-year deanship, and long before the Supreme Court issued its ruling in the FAIR v. Rumsfeld case, we were doing exactly what DOD asked us to do.

Senator Sessions, what I did after the Third Circuit decision was to say, look, the only appellate court to have considered this question has struck down the statute. We have always thought that our policy was in compliance with the statute. The appropriate thing for me to do, really the obligation that I owed to my school and its longstanding policy, was to go back to our old accommodation policy which allowed the military full access, but through the veterans organization. When DOD came to us and said that it thought that that was insufficient, that it wanted to essentially ignore the Third Circuit decision, because it was taking it up to the Supreme Court, when they came back to us, we went through a discussion of a couple of months and made a decision to do exactly what DOD wanted.

Senator Sessions, we did what DOD asked for because we have always, you know, tried to be in compliance with the Solomon amendment, thought that we were. When DOD—DOD had long held that we were. When DOD came back to us and said, ‘‘No, notwithstanding the Third Circuit decision, we maintain our insistence that you are out of compliance with the Solomon amendment,’’ we said OK.

Senator Sessions, I think, as I said to Senator Leahy, that I tried in every way I could throughout this process to make clear to all our students, not just to the veterans but to all our students, how much I valued their service and what an incredible contribution I thought that they made to the school. I——

Senator Sessions, you are, of course, right that the Solomon amendment is law passed by Congress, and we never suggested that any members of the military, you know, should be criticized in any way for this. Quite to the contrary, you know, I tried to make clear in everything I did how much I honored everybody who was associated with the military on the Harvard Law School campus. All that I was trying to do was to ensure that Harvard Law School could also comply with its anti-discrimination policy, a policy that was meant to protect all the students of our campus, including the gay and lesbian students who might very much want to serve in the military, who might very much want to do that most honorable kind of service that a person can do for her country.

Senator, the military at all times during my deanship had full and good access. Military recruiting did not go down. Indeed, in a couple of years, including the year that you are particularly referring to, it went up, and it went up because we ensured that students would know that the military recruiters were coming to our campus, because I talked about how important military service was, because our veterans organization and the veterans on campus did an absolutely terrific job, a terrific service to their fellow students in talking to them about the honor of military service.

Well, thank you, Senator Leahy. You know, I respect and, indeed, I revere the military. My father was a veteran. One of the great privileges of my time at Harvard Law School was dealing with all these wonderful students that we had who had served in the military and students who wanted to go to the military. And I always tried to make sure that I conveyed my honor for the military, and I always tried to make sure that the military had excellent access to our students. And in the short period of time, Senator Sessions, that the military had that access through the veterans organization, military recruiting actually went up. But I also felt a need to protect our—to defend our school’s very longstanding anti-discrimination policy and to protect the men and women, the students who were meant to be protected by that policy: the gay and lesbian students who wanted to serve in the military and do that most honorable kind of service. And those are the two things that I tried to do, and I think, again, the military always had good access at Harvard Law School. 

Senator Kohl, it is an opportunity to serve this country in a way that, you know, fits with whatever talents I might have. I believe deeply in the rule of law. The Supreme Court is the guardian of the rule of law. And to be on the Supreme Court and to have that significant and indeed awesome responsibility to safeguard the rule of law for our country is an honor that comes to very few people and is just an opportunity to serve. And, you know, that is——

Well, Senator Kohl, I do think that what motivates me primarily is the opportunity to safeguard the rules of law, whatever the issues that might come before the Court. And I think that that is the critical thing. If you do not have a rule of law, if you do not have an independent judiciary that enforces rights, that enforces the law, then no rights are going to be safe or protected. And I think that has to be first and foremost in every judge’s mind, not in the way a legislator might care about some particular issue—I care about the environment or I care about the economy, or something like that. A judge cannot think that way. A judge is taking each case that comes before her and is thinking about how to do justice in that case and is thinking about how to protect the rule of law in that case, how to enforce the law, whether it is the Constitution or a statute.

Senator Kohl, I think I will take this one case at a time if I am a judge, and I think I will try to evaluate every case fairly and impartially, try to do justice in that case. I think it would, you know, not be right for a judge to come in and say, oh, I have a passion for this and that, and so I am going to, you know, rule in a certain way with regard to that passion.I am much more a person who I look at an issue before me, a case that might come before me, try to figure out what is right with respect to that issue, with respect to that case, and if you are a judge, of course, that means trying to figure out what is right on the law.

Senator Kohl, I think a judge’s job is just to decide each case, and it is hard to say exactly how a judge would make a difference in their lives because you just do not know which cases are going to come before you. It is not like a legislature where youget to kind of craft an agenda and say this year we are going to do the following three things: we are going to work on energy legislation, or we are going to work on civil rights legislation.You know, for a judge it is case by case by case. that is, I think, the right way for a judge to do a job, is one case at a time, thinking about the case fairly and objectively and impartially. And in the course of doing that, of course, people’s lives change because law has an effect on people, and you hope very much that law improves people’s lives and has a beneficial effect on our society. That is the entire purpose of law.But this is not a job, I think, where somebody should come in with a particular substantive agenda and try to shape what they do to meet that agenda. It is a job where the principal responsibility is deciding each case, listening to the parties in that case fairly and objectively, and trying to make a good decision on the law.

Senator Kohl, you are exactly right that the Supreme Court does decide which cases to hear. It is a highly discretionary docket. There are about 8,000 certiorari petitions every year, and only about 80 of them are now taken by the Supreme Court, so maybe one in a hundred. But there are some pretty settled standards for deciding which cases to take. The first thing always is if there is a circuit split, because what the Supreme Court does, one of the principal roles of the Supreme Court is to apply uniformity across our country so that if one court says X and another court says Y and another says Z with respect to the same issue, the Supreme Court is the one that says we have to take this case so we can just set a clear rule, state what the law is so that everybody then can follow it across the country. So that is on reason why the Court typically grants cert on a case. Another set of cases where the Court very typically, often, almost always grants certiorari is when a legislature—excuse me, when another court has invalidated an act of Congress, when a court has said that an act of Congress is unconstitutional. And there the Court almost always says, well, acts of Congress, that is a serious thing to invalidate an act of Congress. You know, for the most part we want to defer to the legislative branch, to the decisions of our elected branches. So that is such a serious thing that the Court is going to take that case. And then I suppose that there is a third category of cases, which is just extremely important legal issues, you know, cases where there is not a conflict among the courts of appeals and there is no invalidation of an act of Congress, but the case presents some just strikingly significant legal issue that it is appropriate for the Supreme Court to consider and to issue a decision on. And I think, you know, in each year there is some number of those cases.

Senator Kohl, I think you can look to my whole life for indications of what kind of a judge or Justice I would be. I think you can certainly look to my tenure as Solicitor General and the way I have tried to approach and handle that responsibility. I think you can look to my tenure at Harvard Law School and think about the various things I did there and the approach that I took. I think you can look to my scholarship, to my speeches, to my talks of various kinds. So I think it may not be quite so easy as with a person where you can just say, well, read this body of decisions. But I think I have had very much a life in the law, a very public life in the law. Senator Schumer referred yesterday to all my scholarship, to all my talks. And I think, you know, you can look to all those things.I hope what they will show—and this is for the Committee to determine, but I hope what they will show is a person who listens to all sides, who is fair, who is temperate, who has made good and balanced decisions, whether it is as Solicitor General or whether it is as dean of Harvard Law School or in any other capacity.

It has been half an hour since I heard about that article.[Laughter.] 

Well, Senator Kohl, I do think that much of what I wrote in 1995 was right, but that I in some measure got a bit of the balance off. So what I wrote in 1995 was that the Senate hadan important role to play, that the Senate should take that role very seriously, that the Senate should endeavor to think about what a nominee was—what kind of Justice a nominee would make, and that that was all appropriate. And I also said that I thought it was appropriate for nominees to be as forthcoming as they possibly could be. And I continue to believe that, and I am endeavoring and will endeavor to do so.I did think, as I suggested earlier, that I got the balance a little bit off. I said then, even then in that 1995 actual, that it was inappropriate for a nominee to ever give any indication of how she would rule in a case that would come before the Court. And I think, too, it would be inappropriate to do so in a somewhat veiled manner by essentially grading past cases. But I do think it is very appropriate for you to question me about my judicial philosophy, on the kinds of sources I would look to in interpreting the Constitution or interpreting a statute, about my general approach to judicial decisionmaking, about the degree to which I would defer or not defer to acts of Congress and the States. I mean, all of those things I think ought to be a subject of debate.

Senator Kohl, I do think that that is the kind of thing that—all I can say, Senator Kohl, is that I will try to decide each case that comes before me as fairly and objectively as I can. I cannot tell you I will move the Court in a particular way on a particular issue because I just do not know what cases——

Well, it might be a fair question. 

Well, I do very much admire Justice Stevens, and I wanted to say so as he left the Court because I think he has done this country long and honorable service, that he has been simply a marvelous Justice in his commitment to the rule of law and his commitment to principle. That is not say that Justice Kagan—if I am so lucky as to ever be called that, ‘‘Justice Kagan’’—would be Justice Stevens. It is just to say that I have great admiration for the contribution that Justice Stevens has made over many period of years, obviously, butJustice Stevens’ contribution to the Court is not calculable in years. It is this extraordinary commitment to the rule of law that was there in his first year and is there in his last.I think it would be just a bad idea for me to talk about current Justices. I have expressed, you know, admiration for many of them.

Senator Kohl, I do not really think that this is an either/or choice. I think that there are some circumstances in which looking to the original intent is the determinative thing in a case, and other circumstances in which it is likely not to be. And I think in general judges should look to a variety of sources when they interpret the Constitution, and which take precedence in a particular case is really a kind of case-by-case thing. The judges always should look to the text. There is no question that if the text simply commands a result—Senators, you can only be a Senator if you are 30 years old—then the inquiry has to stop. But there are many, many provisions of the Constitution, of course, in which that is not the case. When that is not the case, when the text is subject to one or more interpretations, then often you look to the original intent and you consider that original intent carefully. An example of that is in the Heller case, the gun case, where actually all nine Justices in that ruling looked to the original intent. They had different views of what the original intent was, but all nine of them thought it was important and appropriate to actually think about what the Framers had intended when they wrote that language, which of those two meanings the individual right or the collective right they had in mind. But in other cases, the original intent is unlikely to solve the question, and that might be because the original intent is unknowable or it might be because we live in a world that is very different from the world in which the Framers lived. In many circumstances, precedent is the most important thing. One good example of this is an interpretation of the First Amendment where the Court very rarely, actually, says, you know, what did the Framers think about this? The Framers actually had amuch more constricted view of free speech principles than anybody does in the current time. And when you read free speech decisions of the Court, they are packed with reference to prior cases rather than reference to some original history.So I think it is a little bit case by case by case, provision by provision by provision, and I would look at this very practically and very pragmatically, that sometimes some approach—one approach is the relevant one and will give you the best answer on the law, and sometimes another.

Senator Kohl, I know that several of those cases you mentioned are ones in which there is considerable debate. The Leegin case is a good example. The Leegin case is one in which the Court overturned a very long-term precedent, many, many decades precedent, maybe 100 years after the Dr. Miles precedent. And the Court did so really on the basis of new economic theory, new economic understandings, but there is some question, to be sure, as to how new economic understandings ought to be incorporated into antitrust law. There, the question was how one should look at vertical agreements rather than horizontal agreements, agreements between a manufacturer and a distributor, and the question of whether those agreements are per se uncompetitive or whether they should be subject to more of a rule-of-reason analysis. And I believe the Court had held that they were per se uncompetitive, non-competitive, and per se violative of the antitrust laws and changed that to a rule-of-reason analysis.But I think on the one hand it is clear that antitrust law needs to take account of economic theory and economic understandings, but it needs to do so in a careful way and to make sure that it doesso in a way that is consistent with the purposes of the antitrust laws, which is to ensure competition, which is, as you say, to be a real charter of economic liberty.

Senator Kohl, I think that that decision does present the question that we just talked about, which is, you know, how sort of new economic theory ought to be incorporated into antitrust law, and especially to the extent that the Court has already ruled on a case, to the extent that the Court already has settled precedent in the area, it does raise the question of what it takes to reverse a precedent, a question on which there is a large body of law.I am not going to grade the Leegin decision, but I do recognize very much the concern that some have said about it, which is this question of when you have precedent in the area, when the antitrust laws have been interpreted in one way over time, and new economic understandings, new economic theory might suggest a different approach, how one balances those two things. And I think that is a very important question for the Court going forward.

Well, Senator Kohl, this is actually something that I spoke about when I was nominated as solicitor general before I was ever nominated to this Court. So I have expressed a view on this question and I recognize that some members of the Court have a different view. And certainly when and if I get to the Court I will talk with them about that question. But I have said that I think it would be a terrific thing to have cameras in the courtroom.And the reason I think is as when you see what happens there, it’s an inspiring site. I guess I talked about this a little bit in my opening statement yesterday. I basically attend every Supreme Court argument. You know, once a month I argue before the Court and when I’m not arguing I’m sitting in the front row watching some member of my office or somebody else argue. And it’s an incredible site because all of these—all nine Justices, they’re so prepared, they’re so smart, they’re so thorough, they’re so engaged, their questioning is rapid-fire. You’re really seeing an institution of government at work, I think, in a really admirable way. And, of course, the issues are important ones. I mean, some of them will put you to sleep, you know, but——[Laughter.] Ms. KAGAN—[continuing]. But a lot of them, the American people should be really concerned about and should be interested in. And so I think it would be a great thing for the institution and moreimportant I think it would be a great thing for the American people.Having said that, I mean, I have to say, I understand that some of the current justices have different views, have concerns about it, maybe that they think it would actually change the way the Supreme Court arguments do work. And I would, you know, very much want to talk with them about those views. And, on almost every issue I’m open to being persuaded that I’m wrong. But on this one, I have expressed a real view and it’s the one I hold is that it would be a great thing for the Court and it would be a great thing for the American people.

Senator Kohl, I think I might disagree that it’s the kind of decision that will never come before the Court again. Of course, you’re right that ‘‘it’’ will never come before the Court again. But the question of when the Court should get involved in election contests in disputed elections is, I think, one of some magnitude that might well come before the Court again. And if it did, you know, I would try to consider it in an appropriate way. And, you know, reading the briefs and listening to the arguments and talking with my colleagues. I think it is an important—an important question and a difficult question about how an election contest that at least arguably the political branches can’t find a way to resolve themselves; what should happen and whether and when the Court should get involved. It’s hard to think of a more important question in a Democratic system and it may be a tougher one.

I hope that they will, Senator Kohl. And as we go around the room and people talk to me about the way in which I would decide cases, the approach I would use, just the way you asked me about, you know, would I just look to the original intent, or would I look to a broad variety of sources and when and where, I hope that the American people will get a sense of how I would approach cases.

There’s no question that the First Amendment limits what Congress and what other state actors, executive officials can do.

Political speech is at the core of the First Amendment. I think that that has been said many times by the Court.

Senator Hatch, the quote that you read I believe was not written by me in my voice. It was a set of talking points that I prepared for—I’m not sure if it was for the President—for President Clinton or if it was for the press office, but it was meant to reflect the administration’s position at the time. The administration was trying very hard to Enact the McCain/Feingold Bill and those talking points were in service of that objective and so they weren’t, you know, my personal constitutional or legal views or anything like that, but was just a set of talking points that I prepared for, I think it was the press office. It might have been for the president himself.

I created a lot of talking points in my time. [Laughter.] 

Senator Hatch, I argued the case. Of course, I walked up to the podium and I argued strenuously that the bill was constitutional. 

And over the course—at least for me, when I prepare a case for argument, the first person I convince is myself. Sometimes I’m the last person I convince. But the first person I convince is myself and so, you know, I did believe, that we had a strong case to make. I tried to make it to the best of my ability. 

You’re right, Senator Hatch, that this was an independent expenditure case rather than a contributions case. 

I do agree that civic organizations are very important in our society, Senator. 

Yes. You’re right that the statute that the government defended in the Citizens United case was a statute that applied to many different kinds of corporations.

And one of the things that the government suggested to the Court in the course of its arguments was that one possibly appropriate way to think about the case might be to treat those different situations differently. But the statute itself applied to many different kinds of organizations. 

Senator Hatch, what the government tried to argue in that case was that Congress had compiled a very extensive record about the effects of these independent expenditures by corporations generally and by unions generally on the political process. And that what the Congress had found was that these corporations and unions had a kind of access to Congressmen, had a kind of influence over Congressmen that changed outcomes, that was a corrupting influence on Congress. And that was what the many, many, many thousand-page record that was created before Congress enacted the McCain-Feingold Bill revealed and that’s what we tried to argue to the Court. 

Senator Hatch, Congress determined that corporations and trade unions generally had this kind of corrupting impact on—— 

Senator Hatch, of course, in the Solicitor General’s Office we defend statutes and Congress determined—— 

No, go ahead. 

And it gets the spotlight off me, you know, so I’m all for it. Go right ahead. 

Just hot. 

Well, Senator Hatch, I want to say, Senator Hatch you should be talking to Senator Feingold, but I won’t do that. Senator Hatch, Congress made a determination here. And the determination was that corporations and unions generally had this kind of corrupting influence on Congress when they engaged in? [Simultaneous conversation.] 

The Solicitor General’s Office, of course, defends statutes as they’re written. And Congress made the determination broadly that corporations and trade unions had this corrupting influence on Congress. And in the Solicitor General’s office we in the Solicitor General’s office, as other Solicitor Generals offices have done, vigorously defended that statute as it was written. 

On the basis of the record that was made in Congress, this, I think it was in a 100,000-page record about the corrupting influence of independent expenditures made by corporations and unions. Now, the Court rejected that position. The Courtrejected that position in part because of what you started with. You said, ‘‘Political speech is of paramount First Amendment value’’ it’s no doubt the case. And the Court applied a compelling interest standard and the Court rejected the position. But the position that we took was to defend the statute to apply broadly.

Senator Hatch, speaker-based restrictions do usually get strict scrutiny from the Supreme Court and for the reason that you suggest which is a concern about why it is that Congress is saying one speaker can speak and not another.I had a very interesting colloquy with Justice Scalia at the Court on this question.

Justice Scalia said to me, and it’s a powerful argument, he said, ‘‘Well, you know, if you let Congress think about these things Congress is going to protect incumbents.’’ That that might be a reason for Congress to say that certain groups can make independent expenditures and others not. 

But I said to Justice Scalia and I think it’s true with respect to the McCain-Feingold Bill that all the empirical evidence actually suggests—I think my line was, ‘‘this is the most self-denying thing that Congress has ever done.’’ Because all the empirical evidence suggests that these corporate and union expenditures actually do protect incumbents and notwithstanding that in the McCain-Feingold Bill Congress determined that it was necessary in order to prevent corruption to prevent those expenditures. But, you know, the Court said no. 

Me too. 

Senator Hatch—— 

Senator Hatch, the statute which applies only to corporations and unions when they make independent expenditures, not to their PACs. The corporations and unions when they make independent expenditures within a certain period of an election the statute does not distinguish between movies and anything else. 

Senator Hatch, we were of course—I was defending the statute? 

Senator Hatch, I’m trying to remember what our brief said, but, yes, I think the way we argued the case?

Of course. 

Senator Hatch, what we did in the Citizens United case was to defend the statute as it was written which applied to all electioneering materials with the single exception of books which we told the Court were not the kind of classic electioneering materials that posed the concerns that Congress has found to be posed by all electioneering materials of a kind of classic kind. Books are different. Books, you know, nobody uses books in order to campaign. 

I thought that I said the argument was that they were covered by the language of the statute, but that a good constitutional challenge, as applied constitutional challenge could be made to it because the purposes that Congress had in enacting the statute, which were purposes of preventing corruption, would not easily have applied to books. But would have applied to all the materials that people typically use—— 

Senator, putting the Citizens United case to the side, I think that there are extremely important constitutional principles that prevents the government from picking and choosing among speakers, except in highly unusual circumstances, with hugely compelling interests.

Senator, as I said, putting Citizens United to the side, I argued that case. I argued it on behalf of the government, because Congress had passed a statute. We are——

I’m sorry? 

I absolutely said, Senator Hatch, that when I stepped up to the podium as an advocate, I thought that the U.S. Government should prevail in that case and that the statute should be upheld. I wanted to make a clear distinction between my views as an advocate and any views that I might have as a judge. I do think Citizens United is settled law going forward. There is no question that it’s precedent, that it’s entitled to all the weight that precedent usually gets. I also want to make clear that in any of my cases as an advocate, and this is Citizens United or any of the other cases in which I have argued, I’m approaching the things—the cases as an advocatefrom a perspective of, first, the U.S. Government interests and, also, it’s a different kind of preparation process.You don’t look at both sides in the way you do as a judge. 

Senator Hatch, this case did, as you say—these parties were domestic, nonprofit—was a domestic, nonprofit corporation. 

I’m sorry, Senator Hatch. 

Would you read that again? I’m worry.

Senator Hatch, the First Amendment protects all of us and grants all of us rights.

Senator Hatch, I think that the—— 

Senator Hatch, I think that there was a significant issue in the case about whether Austin was an anomaly, as you quoted, or whether it was consistent with prior precedent and consistent with subsequent precedent, as well. And, certainly, the government argued strenuously that Austin was not an anomaly, although the Court disagreed and held that it was. 

Yes, that’s exactly right, Senator Feinstein. 

We said that the act ought not to be applied. It had never been applied to books. We thought it never would be applied to books. And to the extent that anybody ever tried to apply it to books, what I argued in the Court is that there would be a good constitutional challenge to that, because the corrupting potential of books is different from the corrupting potential of the more typical kinds of independent expenditures. 

Just you and me. 

Senator Feinstein, because the Court decided them as they did and once the Court has decided a case, it is binding precedent.Now, there are various reasons for why you might overturn a precedent; if the precedent proves unworkable over time or if the doctrinal foundations of the precedent are eroded or if the factual circumstances that were critical to why the precedent—to the original decision, if those change.But unless one can sort of point to one of those reasons for reversing a precedent, the operating presumption of our legal system is that a judge respects precedent, and I think that that’s an enormously important principle of the legal system.It defers to prior justices or prior judges who have decided something and that it’s not enough, even if you think something is wrong, to say, ‘‘Oh, well, that decision was wrong, they got it wrong.’’ The whole idea of precedent is that’s not enough to say a precedent is wrong.You assume that it’s right and that it’s valid going forward. 

Senator Feinstein, I do think that the continuing holding of Roe and Doe v. Bolton is that women’s lives and women’s health have to be protected in abortion regulation. Now, the Gonzalez case said that with respect to a particular procedure, that the statute Congress passed, which passed a statute without a health exception and with only a life exception, was appropriate because of the large degree of medical uncertainty involved—— 

Because of the procedure. But with respect to abortion generally, putting that procedure aside, I think that the continuing holdings of the Court are that the woman’s life and that the woman’s health must be protected in any abortion regulation. 

Senator Feinstein, the conversation that Senator Graham and I had, and I believe, in that same hearing, you asked a similar question, starts with the Hamdi case, where the Supreme Court said that the AUMF, the authorization for the use of military force, which is the statute that applies to our conflict with Iraq and Afghanistan, that the AUMF includes detention authority.And Hamdi said that the law of war typically grants such authority in a wartime situation and interpreted the AUMF consistent with the law of war understanding.Now, the question of exactly what the scope of that detention authority is has been and continues to be the subject of a number of cases. And in the role of Solicitor General, I’ve participated in some of those issues.The Obama Administration has a definition of enemy belligerents that it believes are subject to detention under the AUMF and as approved by Hamdi, and the Solicitor General’s office has used that definition of an enemy belligerent, which is a person who is part of or substantially supports the Al Qaeda and Taliban forces.That’s the definition that the Solicitor General’s office has advocated, as has the rest of the Justice Department.Now, there are a number of uncertain questions in this area that almost surely will come before the Supreme Court, questions about whether the scope of the definition that the Obama Administration has been using is appropriate, whether it is too broad, whether it is too narrow; where the battlefield is; what counts as—do you have to be a member of a fighting force or is it sufficient that you support the fighting force, and, if so, what kind of support might give rise to detention.So all of those questions are, I think, questions that might come before the Court in the future. The Obama Administration has taken views as to some of them, not all of them, in cases that have been litigated over the past couple of years.But there are certainly quite a number of questions that will come before the Court about the exact scope of detention authority.

Well, Senator Feinstein—— 

Senator Feinstein, the way that the Solicitor General’s office has argued these cases, and the entire Department of Justice has, is on the basis of statutory authority, is on the basis of the AUMF, the authority for the use of military force.And we have actually never argued that Article 2 alone would provide such authority. And the question you raise really—the usual framework that people use when they think about this question is something called Youngstown, of course, Justice Jackson’s opinion in Youngstown, and he sets forth three different zones.He says, well, in one zone, the President can act in accordance with Congressional authority, and that is the easiest for a court to validate; to say, ‘‘Look, Congress and the President are acting together, the President is acting in specific accordance with what Congress has told the President to do. The courts should give real deference to that.’’

Yes. Essentially, what the Solicitor General’s office and the Department of Justice have been arguing in these last 2 years is that we’re in zone one, which is where the executive is acting with Congress’ authorization, rather than in zone two, where the executive is acting and Congress hasn’t said anything, or zone three, where the executive is acting as against Congress’ statement to the contrary. So those would present very different issues. Whether the President has authority to detain where Congress has not said anything or, still yet, whether the President has the authority to detain where Congress has specifically deprived him of that authority, that would be a very different question, indeed. 

Well, Senator Feinstein, I would have to take a look at the statute. But I would say that the circumstances in which the President can act as against specific Congressional legislation, where the President can act despite Congress, are few and far between, and I think that that’s what Justice Jackson said in Youngstown and I think that that’s what mostly the Court has agreed with, few and far between. Now, are they nonexistent? Well, suppose Congress said something like ‘‘We’re going to take away the President’s pardon power,’’ a power that’s specifically committed to the President by Article 2, I think that that would be a hard case.I think a court might say, ‘‘Well, notwithstanding that Congress tried to do that, Congress can’t do that. The President has that power and it doesn’t matter what Congress says about the matter.’’But those are very few and far between. For the most part, the presumption is that the President, if told by Congress that he can’t do something, can’t do something.

Well, Senator Feinstein, this will, I think, very much be a case that may come before the Court, is the question of how detention authority, whether detention authority exists with respect to people who are apprehended in the United States.The Court has not addressed that question so far. The Court has addressed, in Hamdi, only a person who was actually captured on the battlefield. The Court has left open the question of whether detention authority might exist for a person captured outside of the battlefield, but outside of the United States, and, also, has left open the question of whether detention authority, under the AUMF now I’m talking about, would exist as to a person captured in the United States.There is a fourth circuit decision on that subject. It’s the AlMarri case, where the court was very closely divided, where a slim majority of the court stated that the court—that there was detention authority under the AUMF to detain a person in military custody captured in the United States.That case was on its way to the Supreme Court, but never got there. It was mooted out because the person was transferred into civilian custody—excuse me—into the regular criminal justice system. So that case did not come before the Court in Al-Marri. But it’s very much a live possibility.

I believe that that is what the judge said in that case, and that case is still pending, of course, and might come before the Court.I think that the appropriate analysis to use with respect to that case or many others in this area would be the Youngstown analysis, which makes very important what Congress has done. Where Congress authorizes the President, it’s one thing; where Congress has said nothing, still another; where Congress has specifically barred the activity in question, you’re talking about a much, muchhigher bar for the President to jump over in order for the action to be found constitutional.

Senator Feinstein, I don’t know the case that you mention at all. I think the typical approach of a court, obviously, when it interprets a statute, and this is very important, is to figure out what Congress meant when it enacted that statute.The court acts outside its proper boundary in trying to impose its own meaning on a statute or to improve on the meaning that Congress gave to the statute. Instead, the legislative power is Congress’ and what the court is supposed to do is to figure out what Congress meant.Now, sometimes that’s not so easy, because sometimes language is imprecise, new circumstances develop, it’s unclear how Congress intended for a statute to apply, or sometimes Congress has even— just they make a mistake, they’re careless, whatever. Sometimes you do that, right?So sometimes there’s some lack of clarity, some ambiguity in a statute, and, there, the appropriate course, the course that the court has chosen, and I’ve written about this in my scholarly work, is to give deference to the agency.And the idea of the law in this area, it’s called the Chevron Doctrine, the idea of the law is that Congress, in enacting a statute and in giving authority to the agency to implement that statute, has impliedly delegated power to the agency to clarify any ambiguities that might arise in that statute; and, that it’s more appropriate for an agency to clarify those ambiguities than it is for acourt to do so, and that’s why Chevron says the courts are to give deference to the agency.I have written about this a good deal. My field is administrative law and I’ve written about the Chevron Doctrine. It’s an important doctrine, for the reason I just said, that when there are ambiguities in a statute, when it’s unclear how a statute should apply to a particular kind of administrative action, one possibility is that the court gets to decide that. The other possibility is that the administrative agency gets to decide that.The court says, in Chevron, it’s better for the agency to do so, because the agency has more competence in the area, it has more expertise in the area, because the agency has some political accountability which courts do not have, and, also, because we think that Congress would have made that choice; that Congress would have wanted the entity with political accountability and with expertise to make the decision rather than the courts.In that sense, Chevron is actually a great example of courts saying that the court’s own role should be limited. It should be limited there. It’s with respect to an administrative agency that really has expertise and that has political accountability.

Senator Feinstein, the answer is yes, depending on— much depending on what Congress does. So let me step back for a minute.Article 3 has what’s called a case or controversy requirement, and this is a very important aspect of the judicial system. It’s really one of the things that keep judges judging and not doing anything else, which is that they can only decide concrete cases or controversies.They can’t make pronouncements on issues, legal or otherwise. They can’t issue advisory opinions. They can only decide cases or controversies. And one important aspect of what it means to be a case or controversy is that a person has standing to bring that case.And there are usually considered to be three requirements for that standing. First, a person has to have suffered an injury; sec-ond, the person has to show that that injury was caused by the action that she is complaining about; and, third, the person has to show that the relief that the person is seeking from the court will actually redress the injury.And all of those are important. They are all actually constitutional requirements. Now, that injury can be of many different kinds. It can be economic injury, but it can also be a kind of injury that you get when the environment is degraded and you can’t use the parks in the way you would have wanted to use the parks.

The injury can be of a kind like that, certainly. Now, the Court has said that people have to be able to show that that person specifically has been injured, and there’s some sort of specificity and concreteness requirement that the Court has used in the standing question. But the Court has also made clear that Congress can define, within broad limits, a set of people who Congress believes is injured by a particular practice, such that they can bring suit. So the standing question is one that I think is not entirely, but to a great extent, within Congress’ control; that Congress can say, ‘‘Look, there are some set of people’’ and it gets to define those people as it wants who are injured by some kind of action and who should have an entitlement to go to court to redress that action. 

That’s right. That Congress does that in legislation and if Congress does do that in legislation, within broad limits, as I say, but if Congress does, the Court should respect that and should hold that such a suit complies with Article 3. 

Or how important my answers. 

Senator Kyl, I think it’s law all the way down. When a case come before the court, parties come before the court, the question is not do you like this party or do you like that party, do you favor this cause or do you favor that cause.The question is, and this is true of constitutional law and it’s true of statutory law, the question is what the law requires.Now, there are cases in which it is difficult to determine what the law requires. Judging is not a robotic or automatic enterprise, especially on the cases that get to the Supreme Court. A lot of them are very difficult and people can disagree about how the constitutional text or precedent—how they apply to a case.But it’s law all the way down, regardless. 

Senator Kyl, I don’t know what was in the—I don’t want to speak for the President. I don’t know what the President was speaking about specifically. I do think that in approaching any case, the judge is required really, not only permitted, but required to think very hard about what each party is saying, to try to see that case from each party’s eyes; in some sense, to think about the case in the best light for each party, and then to weigh those against each other. So I think that the judge is required to give consideration to each party, to try to figure out what the case looks like from that party’s point of view, and that’s an important thing for a judge to do. But at the end of the day, what the judge does is to apply the law. And as I said, it might be hard sometimes to figure out what the law requires in any given case, but it’s all the way down. 

That’s correct. 

Here is what I think. I think that courts have to be level playing fields and that everybody has to have an opportunity to go before the court, to state his case, and to get equal justice. And one of the glorious things about courts is that they do provide that level playing field in all circumstances, in all cases.And even when that level playing field is not provided by other branches of government, even when there is some imbalance with respect to how parties come to Congress or the President or the State Houses, the obligation of courts is to provide that level playing field; to make sure that every single person gets the opportunity to come before the court, gets the opportunity to make his best case, and gets a fair shake.

No, no, no. I mean, it’s just a matter of everybody is entitled to have his claim heard. Everybody is entitled to fair consideration. It doesn’t matter whether you’re an individual or you’re a corporation or you’re the government.I mean, one of the really remarkable things about watching, actually, a Supreme Court argument is sometimes I go up there and I’m arguing for the government, very sort of—I mean, you would think it’s kind of a favored position to be arguing for the government, and it turns out it’s not.It turns out that the justices give you, as the government’s representative, just as hard a time, maybe a harder time, than they give everybody else, and that’s the way it should be. Whether you’re the government, whether you’re a corporation, whether you’re a person, no matter what kind of person you are, no matter what your wealth, no matter what your power, that you get equal treatment from the Court.And what I meant by equal treatment is just that the Court takes your claim seriously, takes your case seriously, listens to you as hard as it listens to anybody else, and then makes the right decision on the law.

I do, Senator Kyl. 

Senator Kyl, the last statement you read, the statement about it would be the only case, I think that that was a kind of jokey statement. So I would put that aside. I think what I was saying in that piece is consistent with what I’ve said to you. I think Justice Marshall’s whole life—and this is why I said he revered the Supreme Court. Justice Marshall’s whole life was seeing the courts take seriously claims that were not taken seriously anyplace else. So in his struggle for racial justice, he could go to the State Houses or he could go to Congress or the President and those claims generally were ignored. 

I think that was my words. 

And I meant special as compared with the other branches of government. In other words, that it was the court’s role to make sure that even when people have no place else to go, that they can come to the courts and the courts will hear their claims fairly, and that was what I was saying was a wonderful thing about courts, a miraculous thing about courts; that you can be ignored in every other part of the government and you can come to a court and a court will say, ‘‘It’s our job to treat you with respect, with consideration, with the same kind of attention we give to everybody else.’’ 

Senator Kyl, I guess two points. The first is I guess I don’t want to spend a whole lot of time trying to figure out exactly what Justice Marshall would have said with respect to any question, because the most important thing—I love Justice Marshall. He did an enormous amount for me.But if you confirm me to this position, you’ll get Justice Kagan. You won’t get Justice Marshall, and that’s an important thing.

The thing of glory, Senator Kyl, is that the courts are open to all people and will listen respectfully and with attention to all claims. And at that point, the decision is what the law requires.There may be differences as to what the law does require, but it’s what the law requires, and that’s what matters.I guess I would like to go back to—I’ll just give you one case, just to make sure that——

Senator Kyl, I would not want to characterize the current Court in any way. I hope one day to join it.

The way I would judge is the way I told you, that you make sure that you give very respectful consideration to every person and then determine what you think the Constitution or statute, if the case is a statutory case, requires. 

I actually never heard Justice Marshall say that. I know another co-clerk, another clerk in a different year, wrote that she did. I will say, Justice Marshall was a man who spent manydecades of his life fighting for the eradication of Jim Crow segregation, and you can kind of see why he thought that you should work as hard as you can——

Well, I don’t think I’ve written anything about judging in that way, but I think that you can look to my life, that you can look to the way I interact with people. I mean, my deanship was a good example, but the way I acted as Solicitor General, as well, the kind of consideration that I’ve given to different arguments, the kind of fairness that I’ve shown in making decisions. I think that those would all be appropriate things to look to to try to get some understanding of this aspect of me. 

Senator Kyl, let me step back just a little bit and talk about what clerks did for Justice Marshall. We wrote—Justice Marshall was not in what’s called the cert pool. We wrote probably thousands of memos over the course of the year about what cases the Court should take and what cases the Court should not take. And when I was clerking for Justice Marshall, I was 27 years old and Justice Marshall was an 80-year-old icon, a lion of the law. He had firm views, he had strong views. He knew what he thought about a great many legal questions. He had been a judge for some fair amount of time.And the role of the clerks was pretty much to channel Justice Marshall, to try to figure out whether Justice Marshall would want to take a case, whether Justice Marshall would think that the case was an appropriate one for the Court to take and set aside. And that’s what I did and I think that that’s what my co-clerks did, as well.

I think that the most important factors in the cert petition process, which is, I think, one that I talked to Senator Kohl about maybe, are the ones I gave.First, most importantly are the questions of circuit conflicts, that the court—it’s a very important responsibility of the courts to make sure that our law is uniform and to resolve any conflicts that appear among the circuit courts.Second is the Court should be available almost all the time where a judicial decision invalidates a Congressional statute; that Congress is entitled to that kind of respect, to have the Supreme Court hear the case before a Congressional statute is invalidated.Third, for some set of extremely important national interests, extremely important for any number of reasons, it’s a small category of cases, but it’s an important one, and I think that those would be the considerations that I would primarily use and those would— that is the way I would make decisions.

As I took a look at that memo, Senator Kyl, that was just a reference to the people whom I thought Justice Marshall would favor on the law, and that’s all the reference was meant to suggest; just the people whom I thought Justice Marshall would think had the better of the legal arguments.

Senator Kyl, I’m sure that that was not my reference. The notes that you’re referring to are notes on a telephone call, basically me jotting down things that were said to me. And I don’t remember that conversation at all, but just the way I write telephone notes is not to quote myself.

Or paraphrasing somebody else, but it was not——

As I said, or a paraphrase, but it was—the way I write telephone notes is just to write down what I’m hearing. 

It would be a ludicrous comparison. 

I hope that is not my good friend, Charles Fried I’m referring to. 

I have not seen that memo, Senator Kyl, but I’m sure it was saying essentially the same thing, which was the Solicitor General had the better of the legal arguments, as Justice Marshall would understand the legal arguments. 

I’m sorry, Charles. 

I have tried very hard, Senator Kyl, to take the cases and to make the decisions that are in the interests of my client, which is the U.S. Government. 

Senator Kyl, a Supreme Court justice needs to decide cases on his or her best understanding of the law. 

Yes. 

That’s correct, Senator. 

Senator Kyl, I think what we argued in the petition was that the Arizona statute or at last this part of it was preempted by Congress and, therefore, the decision below was wrong, and that the reason for the Court to take the case was not only that it was wrong, because the Arizona statute was statutorily preempted, but also because this was an important question. It’s one of the category of cases where—— 

The third category. 

That’s right. Lots of States are passing these kinds of laws and the guidance from the Supreme Court would be appropriate as to what kinds of legislation. 

Well, I think for the Supreme Court to set down its view of what the Federal statute preempts would be very helpful to the State legislatures. 

Senator Kyl, what we argued to the Court in the—— 

I’m honestly not sure exactly the words I used. 

But if I might, Senator Kyl. 

What we argued to the Court in Candelaria was that it was a Federal statute in this case—I know that—well, there was a Federal statute in this case. Our best read of that Federal statute was that it preempted the licensing provision of the Arizona law. That was our best understanding of what the Federal statutes did. And that because there’s so much legislative activity in this area happening across this country right now, that for the Supreme Court to decide that question and to determine whether the Federal statute preempted the State law was one of those moments where the issue is of real significance across the country.

I think that this is a significant issue and people, I think, on both sides agree that it is a significant issue as to whether the Federal statute prevents States from doing this. And this is, again, not a decision or a view as to whether these State statutes are good or bad. They might be very good.The only question is whether Congress has, by legislation, and here the legislation was in the immigration——

Senator Kyl, what we argued in the brief was that the Arizona law did not qualify under that exception, because what that exception was meant to talk about were sort of traditional licensing laws of the kind when you license a lawyer or you license a doctor or you license a chiropractor, but not a law that essentially imposes sanctions on any employer for hiring illegal aliens.

Yes. We definitely took a different position, Senator Kyl, and the reason we did is this statute clearly would prevent a State from saying anybody who hires an undocumented or illegal alien would be fined $25.The statute clearly prevents a State from saying that, from imposing a penalty on an employer who hires an illegal alien. And if the statute clearly prevents a State from imposing a penalty like that, then surely the statute also prevents a State from imposing a penalty, which is the withdrawal of any of the——

I don’t know that, Senator Kyl. Sometimes they listen to us and sometimes they don’t. Sometimes we tell them in no uncertain terms this is a terrible case to take, and they take it anyway.

This is a case where—and those of—the 80 percent statistic, I think, is the statistic when the government files its own cert petition. I think that we do much less well with the Court when we just—when we answer the Court’s requests for our advice on whether to take—— 

I hope we do well. 

Senator Feingold, the U.S. Government in the case did urge the Court not to decide the case on the grounds that it did. It’s obviously unusual whenever the Court reverses a precedent in this way. The Court thought it had grounds to do so, but it is an unusual action, yes. 

Senator Feingold—— 

Senator Feingold, certainly, the case, as it came to the Court, did not precisely address—did not address the question that the Court ended up deciding.

Oh, I don’t know, Senator Feingold. I’m not, you know, an expert in public reaction to things and I don’t think that the Court should appropriately consider the public reaction in that—in that sense.

Senator Feingold, I read the same newspapers that everybody else does.

I don’t know, Senator. 

Where the President could authorize the violation of criminal laws that Congress has passed? 

Senator Feingold, I couldn’t think of any circumstance offhand. I don’t want to say categorically that there might never be one if something was very much at the core of presidential power under Article 2. But it’s—it would be a highly, highly unusual circumstance. 

It’s interesting, Senator Feingold, because I think I read someplace where you stated a hypothetical which was, suppose Congress made somebody else Commander-in-Chief and the President said, I’m going to ignore that and I’m going to continue to be Commander-in-Chief. I don’t know where I read that, that you had said that. It struck me as a good example of something where, you know, that’s core Commander-in-Chief power.

I do not know of any court case like that, that’s correct.

I think the Court has an important role. I mean, the Court generally, I think, has a very important role in policing constitutional boundaries. And that might be policing the boundaries when Congress or some other governmental actor violates somebody’s individual rights in a way that’s not permitted by the Constitution, or it might be a case in which one branch impermissibly interferes with another branch or impermissibly infringes on the appropriate authority of another branch. So there is some category of cases, of course, as between the political branches, that the Courts sort of have left to the political branches to work out themselves. And to the extent that the political branches can work their problems out by themselves, I think that that’s generally considered and it’s generally right to be considered a good thing. But there are some times when the Court really does have to step in and police those boundaries and make sure that the president doesn’t usurp the authority of Congress or vice versa.

Senator Feingold, it was a speech I gave to the graduating class. When I speak to students and particularly when I speak to them at important moments in their life like graduation when they are really thinking about what careers they want to have in the law, you know, I try to tell them some things that will stick with them and be meaningful to them and some things that I think that it’s important for them to keep in mind as they start their careers. And the rule of law and adherence to the rule of law there’s no more important thing for any law school graduate to keep in the forefront of his or her minds than that.And that was a speech where I thought that there were some current-day incidents as well as I used some historical incidents to just talk about the rule of law. About how no person how ever grand, how ever powerful is above the law; to talk about the importance of adhering to the law no matter the temptations, no matter the pressures that one might be subject to in the course of one’s career. And I think that there’s nothing more important than that, and that’s what I tried to express in that speech.

Well, that was—that was one of the examples I used as Senator Ash—then Attorney General Ashcroft had really taken a very principled stand. And I thought that that was notable and pointed that out along with a number of others where people have taken very principled stands notwithstanding some considerable amount of pressure to do otherwise.

Well, Senator Feingold, I think that the Court—I have not—first, I should say, I have not read all the way through the McDonald decision because it came out yesterday. But, I think that it does not suggest anything to the contrary of what I’m going to say.I suspect that going forward the Supreme Court will need to decide what level of constitutional scrutiny to apply to gun regulations. Some people need Heller to apply strict scrutiny. Other people think that Heller suggests a kind of intermediate scrutiny. I’ve seen sort of both views of that decision. It’s clearly a decision that will come before the Court.I think as you said, the Heller decision clearly does say that nothing in it is meant to suggest the unconstitutionality of certain very long-standing kinds of regulations, and the felon in possession example is the first on that list. But the Court also says that the list is not exhaustive. And so I think that there will be some real work for the courts to do in this area.I should say that the work that I did in the Clinton White House was all work, of course, before Heller was decided. And so we reallydidn’t, you know, apply this kind of scrutiny, this kind of examination to those—to those decisions. What President Clinton was trying to do back in the 1990s and what I as his policy aide was trying to help him do was to propose a set of regulations that had very strong support in the law enforcement community, that had actually bipartisan support here in Congress to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, to keep guns out of the hands of insane people. It was very much an anti-crime set of proposals that I worked on back then in the 1990s. And, you know, I think that we did not consider those regulations through the Heller prism just because Heller didn’t exist at that time. But I do think that these cases may be coming before the Court and the Court will consider sort of regulation by regulation which meets that standard.

Senator Feingold, I tried my hardest when I was in the—when I worked in the Clinton Administration, including as a lawyer, to provide good legal advice to the President. Now, it’s a context in which one is dealing with law and policy and politics at the same time. That’s the kind of institution it is. But it’s very important for political figures and for the policy people to understand what the law requires and what the law permits and for lawyers to give good advice on those topics and that’s what I tried to do.I should say that none of what I did in the Clinton White House whether as a lawyer for the Administration or as a policy person for the Administration really has much to do with what I would do as a judge.I know that when Chief Justice Roberts was here and he talked about a position that he had had in the Justice Department, I think he separated out those two quite clearly. And I think he was right to do so. But one is simply in a different position and at the same time as one is trying to provide good and independent legal advice to the President, one is also part of the President’s team and doing so in that context. A very, very different kind of context from the context that I would be approaching cases as a judge.But I will say that I think that my experience in the White House during the 1990s is valuable in one sense, which is that it taught me to very much respect the other branches of government. You know, I’m not a person whose experience is only and all about courts. I don’t think courts are all there is in this government. I think that the political branches, Congress and the President are incredibly important actors and should be making most of the decisions in this country. Courts do police the constitutional boundaries and do ensure that Congress and the President don’t overstep their role, don’t violate people’s individual rights. But when it comes to policy, it ought to be courts that—excuse me, it ought to be Congress and the President that do the policymaking. And the courts ought to respect that and ought to defer to that.And I think that my experience in the executive branch and dealing a lot with Congress has made me very respectful of the President’s role and Congress’s role in our government.

Senator Feingold, courts have an important role to play in protecting people under the law who are injured by corporate misconduct or by any other. This is an active area of the law, this question of what limits should be placed, if any, on punitive damage awards.What the Supreme Court did in the Exxon case was really to decide it under its common law maritime powers. This was actually not a due process case as which some prior punitive damages cases have been. Instead what the Court decided, a majority of that Court, was that there was an appropriate ratio of one to one, I believe it was, for punitive damages as compared with compensatory damages as a matter of Federal common law. And the relevance of that fact is that common law typically can be overturned by statute. And so that gives Congress an important role to play in this area. That would, of course, not be the case to the extent that any limits on punitive damages were a matter of the Constitution. But as I understand the Exxon decision, the Exxon decision was based on common law power rather than a constitutional ruling.

I don’t know if it’s more the underdog—— 

Senator Feingold, does it count that I lived in Chicago for some period of my life? 

Senator Feingold, I hope I’ve always been a person who’s able to see beyond my own background and to listen hard to people. Not only we’ve talked about listening hard to people of different political persuasions and views, but to try to learn from people who have different geographic backgrounds, different religious backgrounds, different racial backgrounds. I mean, I think that this is something not only that makes a good judge, but that makes a good human being is to try to learn from people other than yourself. And I hope I’ve used the opportunities that life has provided me in my life to do that.

Well, certainly, Senator Feingold, what Chairman Leahy opened up with which is the whole question of making sure a judge is appropriate—is recused from cases that a judge should be recused from. And there are obviously some hard calls there and some judgment calls. But taking those recusal rules very seriously is something that any judge should do. And I’m not speaking particularly about this case, the case that you mentioned which I know nothing about, but in general I think judges should approach their recusal obligations with a great deal of seriousness and care.

Senator Feingold, I really haven’t thought about that issue since we talked about it. And I would want to speak with the people whom I hope would be my colleagues about it before I answer that question. I think it’s an important question and one worthy of real consideration.

Senator Feingold, I have not had an opportunity to read that case. It was not one that the Solicitor General’s office participated in and I don’t have a view of it or much knowledge about it. I think that in this—in this—in that case the Supreme Court was interpreting a Congressional statute and this is another of the areas where Congress does indeed get to state the rules. So to the extent Congress thinks the Court got it wrong in that case or in any other regarding arbitration, I think it’s appropriate and the Court would and should respect what Congress does.

Senator Feingold, it’s a very broad question and I guess I couldn’t answer it except, you know, with respect to a particular case, a particular set of circumstances, a particular constitutional provision. I’ve not read Noah Feldman’s article on this so I can’t talk about that. But I think, you know, the duty of the Court is obviously to apply the constitution to apply the statutes in any case that comes before it. And to the extent that the Constitutionor some particular statute made illegal some of the conduct that you’re talking about, the duty of the Court is to enforce that.

Senator Feingold, I think that there are important considerations on both sides of this question. On the one hand the President wants to have advisors in appropriate positions, advice he can trust, advice he can count upon. On the other hand Congress has an important interest in accountability and making sure that the President and the President’s actions can be held to account in this institution.I think that the balance between those two, when it comes to the President appointing certain people as Czars or whatever you want to call them, probably is most appropriately determined by the political branches themselves, by the give and take, the back and forth between Congress and the President. Congress, of course, has many ways to express to Presidents that it doesn’t like some set of actions that he’s taken including some appointments that he’s made.I suspect that a judicial case on that subject might be a last resort rather than what seems to me to be the more common, and I think the more appropriate way of dealing with a conflict and a disagreement as to this matter which is Congress and the President kind of battling it out as to the way he should appoint people.Senator Leahy. That will be it for this morning. We’ll come back within a few minutes after the vote which begins at 2:15. I will then recognize the next Republican Senator in line and go to the next Democratic Senator.I hope you get some lunch. Ms. KAGAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Leahy. General, you’re the one who has had to do all the work here this morning. I appreciate your testimony. We stand in recess. [Recess 1 p.m. to 2:27 p.m.] 

Well, I’m not exactly sure what he meant by that, but if he meant that the court should sort of make decisions that the American people—that more appropriately should make, the sort of fundamental policy decisions of our society, I don’t agree with that. As I said, I was talking about Justice Barak, and my admiration for Justice Barak comes from his important role at the State of Israel in ensuring an independent judiciary, and most fundamentally in ensuring that Israel is this strong rule of law nation.

I think that Justice Barak’s philosophy is—is so different from anything that we would use or would want to use in the United States. I mean, for one thing, Israel is a country without any written constitution, a very fundamental difference from the United States. So nothing about what I said about Justice Barak suggests in any way that I think that his ideas about the judge’s role in constitutional interpretation should be transplanted to the United States.

Senator Leahy, if I might just make one last point. I made these remarks about Justice Barak when he came to Harvard Law School to give a speech.One of the things that I did as Dean of Law School was I gave introductions. I gave introductions to many, many people. If any of you had come to Harvard Law School, I would have given you a great introduction, too.

Well, Senator Specter, as you know, I argued that case as you know. I filed briefs on behalf of the United States in that case. In those briefs, the government made a similar kind of argument that great deference was due to Congress in the creation of a quite voluminous——

Senator Specter, as I suggested before, when I walked up to that podium at Citizens United, I thought we had extremely strong arguments. I was acting as an advocate of course, but I thought we had various——

May I try again? Because I think that the answer to that is great deference to Congressional fact finding.

Well, again, I don’t want to characterize what the Supreme Court did. 

Well, to the contrary, Senator Specter. I think it’s extremely important for judges to realize that there is a kind of reasoning and a kind of development of factual material more particularly that goes on in Congress. 

I think that it is very important for the courts to defer to Congressional fact finding, understanding that the courts have no ability to do fact finding, are not, would not legitimately, could not legitimately do fact finding. 

As I said earlier, Senator Specter, I have enormous respect for the legislative process. Part of that respect comes from working in the White House and working with Congress on a great many pieces of legislation. 

Senator Specter, Justice Scalia is not the only person who has been critical of the test. A number of people have noted that the test which is of course a test relating to Congress’ power to legislate under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment that the test has led to some apparently inconsistent results in different cases.So you have a case like Garrett on the one hand and a case like Tennessee versus Lane on the other.

Well, it is the standard of the court right now. It is precedent and it is entitled to weight as precedent.Now, as you very well know, Senator Specter, there are times when the court decides that precedent is unworkable. It just, it produces a set of chaotic results.

No, I wasn’t suggesting that the Wirtz test was unworkable. I think that the question going forward, and it is a question. I’m not stating any conclusion on it, but I think that something that Justice Scalia and others are thinking about is whether the congruent and proportionality test is workable or whether it produces such chaotic results and gives you——

Senator Specter, I’ve not really delved into the question the way I would want to as a judge, reading all the briefs, listening to the arguments, thinking through the issues from bothsides. But I do know that the court needs, excuse me, that Congress needs very clear guidance in this area.It is not fair to Congress to keep on moving the goal posts. It is not fair to say oh well, you know, if you do this this time it will be OK but if you do that the next time, it won’t.

Senator Specter, again, this is one that as an advocate, I have taken a strong view on which is that it was a jolt to the system. There was a great deal of alliance interests involved and many states had passed pieces of legislation in reliance upon Austin that Congress had passed legislation after accumulating a voluminous record.

Senator Specter, it is a little bit difficult to take off the advocate’s hat and put on the judge’s hat. One of the things that I think is important is that I appreciate the difference between the two and I have been an advocate with respect to Citizens United and that’s the way I came to the case, it is the way I approached the case, I hope that I did a good and effective job in it. I believed what I was saying. But it’s a different rule and it’s a different thought process than the role and the thought process that one would use as a judge.

Senator Specter, I assume the good faith of everybody who sits in this chair. There is no reason in my mind to think otherwise.

I do think, Senator Specter, it would be a good thing from many perspectives and I would hope to if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed to engage with the other Supreme Court Justices about that question.I think it is always a good thing when people understand more about government rather than less and certainly the Supreme Court is an important institution and one that the American citizenry has every right to know about and understand.I also think that it would be a good thing for the court itself that that greater understanding of the court I think would go down to its own advantage. So I think from all perspectives, televising would be a good idea.Now, I recognize that some people, some justices may have views to the contrary and I would want to hear those views and to think about those views. But that is sort of my going in thought.

It means I’d have to get my hair done more often, Senator Specter.

That’s very interesting, Senator Specter. I had never considered the relevance of that case to the televising question. But I think certainly the principles in that case, the values in that case are about the public’s ability to know how our governmental institutions work, which is what is critical to this issue as well.

Senator Specter, if I might, just to your first point which was the point about the court’s declining docket. I do generally agree with that. I clerked on the court in 1987 which was pretty much at the high point of what the court was doing, about 140 cases a year.It is a bit of a mystery why it has declined so precipitously. I do agree with you that there do seem to be many circuit conflicts and other matters of vital national significance.

OK. 

Senator Specter, the issue about the TSP and the constitutionality of the TSP is I think one of the kinds of issues I previously set out three categories where the court might grant cert. One which is circuit conflicts, one which is the invalidation of an act of Congress and the third is just an issue of some vital national importance.In a case where the executive branch is determined or is alleged, excuse me, is alleged to be violating some Congressional command, it is I think one of the kinds of cases that the court typically should take.Now, there is in this case the complexity that there is a potential jurisdictional bar. Of course the court typically decided——

Well, the question whether somebody has standed. So often the court will decline to take a case when there is a significant jurisdictional issue because the court will think well, if we take this case, we might hold that we don’t have jurisdiction. 

Yes. You’re exactly right. I’m just suggesting that that is often the reason why a court doesn’t take a case. If it doesn’t know —— 

Senator Specter, I can just tell you, there was this jurisdictional issue. Now, the jurisdictional issue itself was an important one. It was an important one because how is a person going to know whether—— 

I’m not sure I had, I’m not sure I exactly pictured it. 

I think that you have been exercising your constitutional responsibilities extremely well. 

I will say one thing, Senator Graham, which is it just feels a lot different from here than it felt from back there.

I do. 

You know, OK. 

Senator Graham, you know, in terms of my political views, I have been a Democrat all my life. I have worked for two Democratic Presidents and that is what my political views are. 

My political views are generally progressive, generally—— 

It would be hard to disagree that elections have consequences. 

Yes, sir. 

I would expect that. 

I do. 

Miguel and I were classmates at Harvard Law School, but we were more than classmates at Harvard Law School. Harvard Law School has a way of, has required seating in the first year. Miguel and I were—— 

Miguel and I were required to sit next to each other in every single class in the first year. I can tell you Miguel takes extraordinary notes. So it’s great. Every time you missed something in class, you could just kind of look over and, but that’s how I know Miguel. We have been good friends ever since. 

I think he is a great lawyer and a great human being.

I did. 

Senator Graham, I think those comments reflect what an extraordinary human being Miguel Estrada is. I was deeply touched when I read that letter, deeply grateful to him of course and all the nice things that he said about me I would say back about him double. 

He is qualified to sit an as appellate judge, he is qualified to sit as a Supreme Court Justice. 

I would be pleased to do that, Senator Graham. 

I do.

I do. 

I do remember you. 

Yes. 

Well, we are at war with Al Qaeda and the Taliban and under the AUMF, the President has a wide range of authorities with respect to those groups. 

Not that I know of, Senator Graham. 

No, sir. 

I feel as though we are doing this again. 

We are sort of doing an instant replay. 

Under the traditional law of war, it is permissible to hold an enemy combatant until the end of hostilities. The idea behind that is that the enemy combatant not be enabled to return to the battlefield. 

That is exactly the problem, Senator Graham. Hamdi very briefly discussed this problem, the court in Hamdi suggesting that perhaps if this war was so different from the traditional law of war that there might need to be alternative procedures to put in place. For example, one could imagine a system in which because of the duration of this war, it was necessary to ensure that enemy combatants continue in dangerousness. That is a question that I think has not been answered by the court. 

Senator Graham, let me take the question and make it into a legal question because I think it is directly relevant under the Youngstown analysis whether Congress and the Presidents do work together.

That’s correct. 

Senator Graham, I think I don’t want to talk as Solicitor General as to legal policy here. 

But I will say as to the legal matter that it makes a difference. Whether Congress and the President work together, that courts should take note of that, that courts should, when that occurs, the action is at, ought to be given the most deference and that there is a reason for that. It is because the courts are basically saying Congress and the President have come together, Congress and the President have agreed upon a policy jointly and there should be deference in those circumstances. 

I don’t know either of them. I know who they are. 

Well, as Solicitor General, Senator Graham, I have argued the position that this is fully legal. 

I did, Senator Graham. 

In the—Circuit.

Well, that’s correct. 

If I could just say, in general the Solicitor General only signs her name to briefs in the Supreme Court, authorizes appeal but does not sign appellate briefs. I determined that I should be the counsel of record on that brief because I thought that the United States’ interests were so strong in that case based on what the Department of Defense told our office. 

Well, I said that in reference to the cases that I argued specifically. Of course when I write briefs, I write from, or when I sign briefs, when I am counsel of record on briefs, I am taking the position of the United States, that I am representing the position that I believe and that our office believes is most consistent with the long-term interests of the United States government. 

Senator Graham, I chose to put my name on that brief, as I said, which is a very, very rare thing in the appellate courts because I believe that they were very significant—— 

Senator Graham, can I ask whether that statement comes from that brief? 

That statement is my best understanding of the very significant interests of the United States government in that case which we tried forcefully to present to the court. As you said before, the DC circuit, a very mixed panel of the DC circuit upheld our argument. 

Anything that is in that brief, I stand by as the appropriate position of the United States government. 

Senator, I was speaking there as a legal policy matter representing the position of the Obama administration. That’s obviously a very different role as the advocate role that I play is also a different role.

There are certain parts of that that I think that we have not addressed in the United States government. So the United States government has argued that the battlefield extends beyond Iraq and Afghanistan.

Senator Graham, when I was here before, you asked me if I agreed with the Attorney General and I said that it would be bad to disagree with the Attorney General given my position. I am still the Solicitor General and I still agree with the Attorney General.

I certainly would tell him if I thought he was wrong. 

Senator Graham, that is an undecided legal issue. Well, I suppose I should ask exactly what you mean by that. I’m assuming that the question you mean is whether a person who is apprehended in the United States is—— 

You know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant. 

Yes, sir. 

Well, that there was a failed but only just failed terrorist incident. 

Senator Graham, it seemed a close thing. I don’t know more than I read in the newspapers about that incident. 

I was not involved in any of the discussions about what to do on that day. 

Yes, sir. 

Every time one of these things happens, it is extremely unnerving. It makes us aware of the need to take efforts to make sure that such a thing never happens. 

Senator, the way Miranda warnings would come up is of course only with respect to the admissibility of evidence in a criminal court. So to the extent that we are talking about a battlefield capture and not a criminal trial, an Article 3 criminal trial, the Miranda issue would never come up. 

Well, the Miranda issue is only applicable in Article 3 courts as a matter of criminal law. 

I should correct that. I should correct that because I think that the question of whether Miranda is applicable in military commissions has not been decided. 

Senator Graham, I have never dealt with that question as Solicitor General.

Senator Graham, I feel as though—— 

I’m a part of this administration and I think that, you know, I should let the Attorney General—— 

The public safety exception which was, comes from the Quarrels case, it is right now I think a limited exception. It enables—— 

That’s right. 

It enables the police essentially to be able to question to find the gun, you know, to find something that might pose an eminent risk of public safety. 

Well, of course it’s a question that might come before the court in some guise as to whether the public safety exception should apply. 

I suppose on this one, Senator Graham, that I’m reluctant to say how I would think about the question as an average, everyday citizen because I might have to think about the question as a judge and that would be a different way of thinking about the question.

Well, as we discussed before, Senator Graham, I mean, the administration of which I’m a part——

Yes. 

I guess I feel—— 

Yes. I mean, the question of intention of enemy combatants is one that I have dealt with as Solicitor General, it is one that I have argued as Solicitor General. This is a question that I have not dealt with and I am hesitant to make any comments in a personal view or in a policy view given that these questions I think are likely to come before the court. The question of the good faith exception to Miranda, how it applies to terrorism cases is I think quite likely to get to the court. 

No, I didn’t say that. 

I—— 

It was a challenging letter. I think I said that we hold dictatorships to high standards and we should hold ourselves to even higher ones. But I did criticize the initial Graham amendment for——

Well, I’m glad to hear that. 

Right. Well, I think one difference was that military commission adjudications now receive DC circuit review. In fact, the letter we wrote was about that, was saying that military commission adjudication —— 

Well, my initial understanding of the initial Graham amendment—— 

Senator Graham, I really haven’t had any exposure to the military commissions as yet. Of course there has been no military commission proceedings. 

I think that they are absolutely top notch. 

Well, I do think that the military lawyers with whom I have had the pleasure and honor to work as Solicitor General are stunningly good. 

Senator Graham, on the part of an administration that clearly has stated that some people—— 

I do. I wouldn’t be in this administration if I didn’t. 

He is a funny man. 

Senator Schumer, I think there are three components to it. The first is the one that you mentioned which is deference to the political branches. To Congress, to the President, to the states. An understanding that they are looking after the people’s business, that they are acting in good faith, that they too take constitutional oaths, that they ought to be the policymakers for the Nation and that the courts, the courts have an important role to play, but it is a limited role. It is essentially sort of policing the boundaries and making sure that Congress doesn’t overstep its role, doesn’t violate individual rights or interfere with other parts of the governmental system, but that even in doing that, even in policing those boundaries the courts should look at Congress and the President as, it should give them a lot of deference and should be hesitant and reluctant to interfere and should make sure that they understand what Congress is doing and why Congress is doing it before they do. So to sort of give Congress a good deal of the benefit of the doubt to look at those Congressional findings that Senator Specter was asking me about, to really explore what Congress thought it was doing. There will be some times, there will be some times where the courts will have to say no, Congress has overstepped. Congress has violated individual rights or Congress has somehow interfered with state prerogatives perhaps. But those times, the court ought to feel hesitant about doing that and ought to make sure that it has gotten it right. So that’s the first thing. The second thing is respect for precedent. I think precedent is extraordinarily important in our law. It is important because it leadsto predictability and stability in the law, but it is important also precedent itself is a kind of measure of humility.It is a way of current justices saying even if I think these past judges got it wrong, I’m going to be hesitant about saying that. I’m going to doubt myself. I’m going to think that this law that has built up over the years by prior judges has real wisdom to it. Even if I can’t quite see that wisdom right now, I’m going to be hesitant about saying that it doesn’t exist. So it is a doctrine really of humility, of judicial humility.It is also a doctrine of constraint. It constrains judges and makes sure that judges warrant doing, importing anything inappropriate into the decisionmaking process. So the judges aren’t taking their personal views and their personal commitments and their political commitments and using those in the decisionmaking process.If your precedent binds judges, and that is a very good thing for the legal system for that reason, too.I suppose the third part of judicial modesty is a set of rules really about deciding cases. It is making sure that you have a case before you that you’re not deciding an abstract legal issue.It is taking one case at a time, not really thinking down the road how this, if I decide this case this way, maybe another case can be decided that way. Really just focusing on the case before you and the question before you.It is avoiding constitutional questions if you can in favor of statutory questions. It is generally making sure that you are deciding questions on the narrowest possible grounds rather than on broader ones. So all of those techniques of judging, if you will, I mean, some people have called these passive virtues I think are very important.

It would not, Senator Schumer. I mean, with respect to a statute, the only question is Congress’ intent and that’s what the court should be looking at, what Congress wanted the statute to apply to, how Congress wanted the statute to apply.Now, sometimes that won’t be altogether clear. Sometimes Congress leaves ambiguities or uncertainties of various kinds and it is the court’s job to try to clarify those ambiguities and to try to remove those uncertainties, but it should all be done with a question of what is Congress intending here?To the extent that the text suggests that, all well and good. To the extent it doesn’t, I think a judge should look to other sources, should look to the structure of the statute, should look to the history of the statute in order to determine Congress’ will.

I think activism does not have a party. 

Or a philosophy. 

I think that that’s right. 

Well, mostly I learned, Senator Schumer, that you can never do too much listening to people because it turns out you learn a lot by listening. You said that the faculty was fractious and you kind of portrayed them in a negative light, but in truth I loved my faculty and I thought that my faculty was sort of endlessly generous to me and good spirited in terms of the things that they did for the school. I think that that was so in part because people respected that I listened to people, that I was willing to change my mind if they could convince me that I was wrong, and sometimes I was wrong. I got a lot of good ideas from my faculty along the way. So I suppose the best thing I learned by being Dean of that school was just the value of listening hard and realizing that you don’t start by knowing everything. 

Well, Senator Schumer, I think everybody did it. I don’t think I did it. I think everybody did it. I think all I did was try to encourage people to work together and I think that once that started happening, people just understood that working together brought great benefits to the institution. It was a little bit of a kind of virtuous circle, you know, because once it started, it just kept on going. The ball kept on rolling because people saw some of the good things that it brought.

Well, Senator Schumer, I think that if the text of a statute is clear, it would be wrong for a court to say well, the text says X but I don’t think X makes sense, so I’ll choose Y.I don’t think that a court should do that. If the text says X, the text is the best evidence of Congress’ intent and the text might say X for a variety of reasons. Even if you think gee, what sense does that make and how is that consistent with the broad purposes of the statute?In fact, the legislative process is a messy thing and people make compromises along the way and a legislative text is the result of all that deliberation and all those compromises.To the extent that the text says something clear about a statute, the court should stick with that and stick with it even in the court’s view that is not what makes sense.Now, sometimes there is ambiguity in statutes and then the question is well, what do you do? How do you clarify that ambiguity?One of the things to do is to look to Congress’ purposes in enacting a statute and try to figure out, you know, if Congress knew that this result would happen, is that result consistent with Congress’ purpose or not? That’s a very sensible thing for a court to do because in the absence of textual guidance, and maybe in the absence of any structural guidance, one, you know, good and appropriate approach is to look to the purposes of the statute and to try to figure out which interpretation of the statute is more consistent with that Congressional purpose.One way to do that is to say well, what would that interpretation of the statue actually do in the world and is that consistent with what Congress thought ought to be done.

The First Amendment has not been thought to be absolute. I think that the last Justice who thought that was maybe Justice Black. I think almost all Justices have understood.

You know, you yell fire in a crowded theater or you yell into a cardiac victim’s ear, nobody is going to protect that under the First Amendment. 

Well, Senator Schumer, I argued the case before the court. I focused quite heavily on the Congressional record that had been put together before McCain/Feingold. I argued that the court should give deference to that Congressional record.Now, the court disagreed. The court said use the compelling interest standard which I think everybody agreed was the right standard but said that standard had not been met.

Oh, I’m sorry. Senator Schumer, the government argued that it was not an abhorration and this was very much an issue in this case. This was certainly the theory of the other side and it was adopted by the court and specifically discussed in the Chief Justice’s opinion that the chief Justice said that Austin itself had been contrary to prior precedent.The government argued that it had not been. That it was consistent with a line of precedent and with a historic understanding of appropriate role of——

Yes. That’s correct. 

The government certainly argued that moving away from Austin would be a disruption of the system, especially given the reliance that Congress and that the states had placed on Austin.

I think that that’s a pretty good description of Judge Posner, but no I don’t think you should think that.

The same as with Judge Barak. 

One of my greatest introductions was to Justice Scalia. 

Whom I in fact have the greatest admiration for. 

Senator Schumer, the American constitution is an American document with an American history with American precedence. The fundamental way in which courts should approach interpretation of that document is by looking at that document and the American sources that interpret it. Now, there may be instances such as some of the ones that I suggested where international law or foreign law is relevant, you know, the meaning of Embassador, the interpretation of the authorization for the use of military force were two instances I gave. But in general, this is an American constitution which needs to be interpreted by American judges using American sources. 

No, Senator Schumer. It is what I said to Senator Grassley. U.S. constitutional law is basic, it is fundamental, but I do believe that law graduates in our world today need to have some understanding of the laws beyond American shores to do international litigation, to do international transactions.We live in an interconnected world, we live in a competitive world and if our lawyers don’t understand that world, quite honestly we are going to be at a competitive disadvantage.

I think that that would be unthinkable. 

Some law professors would like them to be binding, but no. I agree, Senator Schumer, that the way they are cited in these decisions are just, this isn’t binding, this isn’t precedent, but this is a person who had a good idea and the decision in some sense cites or reflects that. 

Absolutely not. 

That’s correct. 

Of course not. 

I do think that that’s right, Senator Schumer, that judges should keep their minds open, should learn from a variety of sources that are not binding, that do not have precedential force. 

I’m good.

You know, I—I—I don’t think that we—we—we’ve sort of been in and out of touch during those years. I’m not actually sure that we talked during that time. We might have, I’m just not sure. 

Senator Cornyn, I would have done whatever he asked me to do because I think he’s a great lawyer, as I said, and a great human being. I don’t think he ever asked me. There was a time when I was dean when I didn’t do any letters of that kind. Before I was dean, I wrote letters of that kind for Michael McConnell and for Peter Keissler. I think if I didn’t with Miguel, it’s because he never asked me to do so. 

If I could, Senator Cornyn. 

I think I didn’t say that Brown changed the Constitution. I think I said that Brown interpreted the Constitution in a different way than it had been interpreted theretofore. I do think it’s hard to make the case that school desegregation was thought of as commanded by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, and I think that there are a variety of other practices that similarly were countenanced in 1868 that are not now. That doesn’t mean that the Constitution has changed. In fact, the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause is a quite general provision. It speaks in broad terms. It lays down a general principle of equality. And in writing the provision that way, I think that the drafters of the Constitution knew exactly what they were doing. They didn’t mean to constitutionalize all of their practices in 1868. They meant to set forth a principle of equality that would be applied over time to new situations and new conditions, and I think that that’s exactly what has occurred. 

I think the Constitution is a timeless document, setting forth certain timeless principles. It’s the genius of the Constitution that not everything was set forth in specific terms, but that instead certain provisions were phrased in very general terms that enabled people, that enabled the courts over time to apply the principle to new conditions and to new circumstances.I think that that’s the continuing obligation of the Court to do that, to ensure that the Constitution does apply appropriately and that the timeless principles set forth in the Constitution do apply appropriately for our posterity.

You know, I think that—I—I don’t particularly think that the term is apt, and I especially don’t like what people associate with it. I think people associate with it a kind of loosey-goosey style of interpretation in which anything goes, in which there are no constraints, in which judges can import their own personal views and preferences. And I most certainly do not agree with that.I think of the job of constitutional interpretation the courts carry on as a highly constrained one, as constrained by text, by history, by precedent, and the principles imbedded in that precedent. So the courts are—are—are limited to specifically legal sources. It’s a highly constrained role, a circumscribed role.So to the extent that that term is used in such a way as to suggest that that’s not the case, I don’t agree with that. But I do think, as I just indicated, that the Constitution, and specifically— not the entire Constitution, but the general provisions of the Constitution, that the genius of the drafters was—was to draft those so that they could be applied to new conditions, to new circumstances, to changes in the world.

The Constitution does not change. The Constitution is a—you know, unless by amendment. The Constitution is a document that—that—that does not change, that is timeless, and—and timeless in the principles that it embodies. But it of course is applied to new situations, to new facts, to new circumstances all the time. In that process of being applied to new facts and new circumstances and new situations, development of our constitutional law does indeed occur.

Senator Cornyn, Article 5 gives the—the only way to actually amend the text of the Constitution. That is the only way to amend the text of the Constitution. But I also want to say again the sort of second half of this, that the text of the Constitution has to be applied to new circumstances, to new conditions, to new developments in the world, and that it’s the job of the courts to do that.

I think that’s right. The Constitution is the Constitution, but it is interpreted and it applies to new facts as they come up, new cases as they come up, new circumstances as they come up.

Just to, you know, give a concrete example of this, and it goes to—— 

I think that judges are always constrained by the law. They’re constrained by—you know, I mean, sometimes the text speaks clearly and then they’re constrained by the text alone. Where the text doesn’t speak clearly, they look to other sources of law. They look to original intent, they look to continuing history and traditions, they look to precedent and the principles embodied in those precedents. But they’re always constrained by the law. It’s law all the way down. 

Senator Cornyn, I guess I actually think that in recent decades the Court has suggested that there are some limits on the scope of the Federal Government, so if you go back to the earliest days, Chief Justice Marshall and Gibbons v. Ogden, that was the first case that—at least the first important case that interpreted the scope of the Commerce Clause, and there Justice Marshall wrote a fairly expansive opinion, talking about the interconnectedness of the United States and the need for the Nation to function as a Nation.Now, over time the Court imposed very significant limits on Congress’ power. This was basically until about 1935, imposed very significant powers—limits on Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause. At that point, a switch took place and—and the Supreme Court determined that the old jurisprudence really wasn’t working, that the distinctions that the Court had set up between direct and indirect effects on Congress wasn’t working, that the distinction that the Court had set up between manufacture and commerce wasn’t working. And the Court also, I think, realized—and this was really the great recognition of those New Deal years—was that deference to Congress was appropriate in this area.

Well, I think the current state of the law is to grant broad deference to Congress in this area, to assume that Congress knows what’s necessary in terms of the regulation of the country’s economy, but to have some limits. The limits are the ones that were set forth in the cases that you mentioned, the Lopez case and the Morrison case, which are where the activity that’s being regulated is not itself economic in nature and is activity that’s traditionally been regulated by the States.But to the extent that Congress regulates the channels of commerce, the instrumentalities of commerce, and also to the extent that Congress is regulating things that substantially affect interstate commerce, there the Court has given Congress broad discretion.

Well, I do think that there are limits on Congress’ commerce power. They’re the limits that were set forth in Lopez and Morrison, and they’re basically limits saying that Congress can’t regulate under the Commerce Clause where the activity in question is non-economic in nature. I think that that’s the limit that the Court has set. But within that, you’re quite right that Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause to act. To the extent that you or anybody else thinks that Congress ought not to have that authority under the Commerce Clause to act, an amendment to the Commerce Clause would be a perfectly appropriate way of changing the situation.

Under—— 

Yes, yes, yes. 

I mean, any—any—— 

You know, any part of it. 

Any part of the—— 

Any part of the Constitution can be amended through Article 5. 

Yes. Surely. The entire idea of precedent is that you can think a decision is wrong, you can have decided it differently if you had been on the Court when that decision was made, and nonetheless you are bound by that decision. That’s the—if—if—if— if the doctrine of precedent enabled you to overturn every decision that you thought was wrong, it wouldn’t be much of a doctrine. 

That’s quite right, Senator Cornyn. It’s a really fundamental difference between the legislative process and the judicial process. The reason that the doctrine of precedent has developed— or I suppose many reasons. One is just the incredible importance of stability in the system, but also just a notion of humility, thatno judge should look at a case and say, oh, I would have decided it differently, I’m going to decide it differently, that a judge should—should view prior decisions with a great deal of humility and deference.

I do believe that, Senator Cornyn. I think when— when the Court looks as though it’s flipping around and changing sides just because the justices have changed, that that’s bad for the credibility of the institution and it’s bad for the system of law.

You know, I just don’t know what you’re referring to, Senator Cornyn. I’ve not seen that ever.

You know, gunners is a kind of law school term of art. 

Senator Cornyn, I’ve not yet had a chance to read the McDonald opinion that came out yesterday, but I know that in Heller the Court specifically says that nothing in the opinion is meant to suggest the unconstitutionality of a number of kinds of provisions. I think the kinds of provisions listed in Heller are felon and possession laws, are laws regulating the possession of guns in certain sensitive places, and I think that there’s one dealing with various commercial activities regarding guns. 

So the Court said that really nothing, in its opinion, is meant to in any way cast doubt on the constitutionality of those longstanding laws. 

Senator Cornyn, I think that Heller is settled law, and Heller has decided that the First—excuse me, that the Second Amendment confers such an individual right to keep and bear arms.

There is no reason I know of, that McDonald, as well as Heller, as settled law and entitled to all the weight that precedent usually gets.

I don’t think so. I’m not sure what I—what I said that you might have gleaned that from. I actually did write an article about this during my years as a law professor at the University of Chicago. It was not that the Court should look to the motives of the legislature, it was really that First Amendment doctrine— a lot—quite a number of the rules of First Amendment doctrine were understood as reflecting a concern about governmental motive, but that the rules were set up so that the court never had to make that underlying inquiry about governmental motive.

Senator Cornyn, I think that the Court does it, but not by looking directly at motive. The—the most—one of the most important doctrines of the First Amendment is the near-complete ban on viewpoint discrimination, that viewpoint discrimination is held to the highest constitutional standard.And that’s because of a concern that the majority is attempting to suppress the speech of a minority, and the classic example is very much along the lines that you gave, is a legislature saying there will be no speech by Republicans or there will be no speech by Democrats. And the way that the Court would view that is that that’s a classic example of a viewpoint discrimination and is pretty much presumptively prohibited.

Senator Durbin, the crack cocaine ratio is the part of our sentencing system that I’ve had most to do with as a policy matter. When I was in the Clinton White House and when I was serving as a policy aide to the President, we did deal with this issue and suggested that the ratio be reduced to 10:1. I think at that point some of us felt that it might go down even further, but thought that 10:1 was the practical approach to take, that it was conceivable.Now, in the end it wasn’t. That was—that—that—that—the Clinton administration did not manage to make progress on that issue. I know that the Attorney General whom I serve, and the President, President Obama, has stated that their view is that it should go down all the way to 1:1, that in fact there’s no real rational distinction between crack and powder cocaine for—for sentencing purposes.The—and that—and that that—the distinction that does exist is a distinction that has a great deal of racially disproportionate impact. I know that Congress has—has struggled with this issue. It is a policy issue, quintessentially. It’s one, you know, that Justice Kennedy—he could have said, well, this is a good idea, or that’s a good idea, but it really is one for Congress. There’s—there’s nothing that the Supreme Court, or that any court, can do about it.It’s really one that Congress has to decide, what the sentencing rules ought to be with respect to—to crack and power cocaine. As a policy aide to President Clinton, and President Clinton felt strongly that it should go down. I tried to the best of my ability to implement his policy view on that question. President Obama believes the same. But as a judge—as a judge, the only thing that would matter would be the actual statute and—and unless and until Congress changes that statute, the—the current sentencing system would be the system that any judge should apply.

Senator Durbin, the crack/powder distinction is the one that I’ve dealt with most. There—there are many that I have not dealt with as a policy matter. I have seen some sentencing issues with—in my time as Solicitor General, but I have tried very hard during that time to apply the law that exists and to take ap-peals in the way that—that—that appropriately implements that law.So, you know, I think this—I think justices of the Supreme Court are appropriately interested in these kinds of questions. I know Justice Kennedy has taken a deep interest in sentencing issues. I think that that’s much to his credit, but it’s a kind of interest that I think has to be advanced in conversations of the kind that he had with you, because when a justice sits on the bench the justice can only apply the law that Congress is—that Congress gives him or her, and it really is up to Congress to decide whether the system that we have is the correct one or whether to change it.

Well, you’re exactly right, Senator Durbin, that this was asked me during my Solicitor General hearing and in the written questions that followed, and I said then what I will repeat today, which is that the constitutionality of the death penalty generally is established law and entitled to precedential weight.

I think somebody also asked me whether I had moral qualms about imposing the death penalty. This was in connection with my Solicitor General nomination, so I think that the concern was whether, in any work as Solicitor General, I could appropriately make decisions. And I said that I had no such moral qualms and that I could conscientiously apply the law as it was written.

I don’t know, Senator Durbin, and I would be reluctant to speak for either one of them. This is obviously a difficult area of the law, an area in which there are great stakes and where people and judges feel their responsibilities is very heavy, and appropriately so. As I suggested to you, I do think that the constitutionality of the death penalty generally is settled precedent. I think even Justice Stevens agreed with that. He—in those comments that he made, he suggested that he did not think it was appropriate to do what Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall had done, which was to dissent in every death penalty case. He thought that that was inappropriate because of the weight of the doctrine of precedent.

Well, they were well-known and Justice Marshall’s clerks had, as a kind of special responsibility, and Justice Brennan’s clerks as well—clerks carry out the vision of the people whom—with—for whom they work, and Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan did believe that the death penalty was unconstitutional in all its applications, but more specifically, I think, viewed themselves as having a special role in each death penalty case to make sure that there were no special problems in the imposition of a death penalty, and if there were, to bring those problems to the attention of the rest of the court to make sure that those issues would not be—would not be missed or overlooked. And the clerks for Justice Marshall and Justice Brennan, of whom I was one, that was a significant part of the job.

Senator Durbin, it would be because I do believe that the constitutionality of the death penalty is settled precedent going forward and—and—and Justice Marshall did not believe that.

Senator Durbin, I think in general the positions that I’ve taken as Solicitor General do not necessarily represent positions that I would take as a justice, and I appreciate your actually suggesting that point in case I haven’t emphasized it enough. The positions that I’ve taken as Solicitor General are positions for the U.S. Government.

And—and are—I have a client and I’m the best advocate I possibly can be for that client. And the role of a judge is— is different from the role of an advocate, and it’s important to recognize that. 

The Supreme Court, in Hamdi, discussed only the detention of enemy belligerants who are picked up on the battlefield. 

Yes. Your understanding is mine, that Hamdi talked only about enemy belligerants who are picked up on the battlefield.

Senator Durbin, I did write that letter and it was a letter that urged Congress to—really the principle point that were making in that letter was that the adjudications made by military commissions ought to be reviewed in Article 3 courts. And as Senator Graham and I discussed earlier, Congress did indeed do exactly that, that the initial amendment was re-crafted into the Graham-Kyl-Levin amendment, and it was really an extraordinary act of bipartisanship that occurred to—I think it was—the vote was 85:14.And one of the things that that piece of legislation did was exactly what—I’m not—I’m not remotely suggesting cause and effect, but the letter urged that there be Article 3 review, and the KylGraham-Levin amendment provided Article 3 review of military commission determinations.

Well, Senator Durbin, I think I guess I would like to make two points and insist that they’re not inconsistent with each other. The first point is that judges are always constrained by law and that the only sources that judges can appropriately look to are legal sources, that judges can’t import their own personal preferences or their political preferences or their moral values, that it would be inappropriate to do so. The role of a judge is to determine, as best that person can, what the law requires and then to do that thing. That’s the first proposition.But the second proposition is that there are hard legal cases where people struggle with these issues, where people struggle with what the text, and the structure, and the history of the Constitution, and the precedents that apply that the Constitution requires in a given case. And—and that can happen in—in cases of the kind that you suggested in Brown, but it happens really all over the place. It happens—it happens not infrequently, I would say, at the Supreme Court level. Just because the Supreme Court is dealing with cases in which lower courts have disagreed, so usually the cases the Supreme Court hears are the hardest cases.Now, sometimes the lower courts disagree, and in fact the case is not so hard, the Supreme Court decides 9:0, and it’s all easy. But there are some very difficult cases which involve clashes of constitutional principles.

Well, Senator Durbin, I actually think that the—that Griswold and that the holding in Griswold does have grounding in the constitutional text, and the way most justices have thought about this is that the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees liberty and that it guarantees—when it guarantees such liberty it means more than freedom from physical constraints, and it also guarantees more than procedural protections, that there is some substantive protection of liberty that’s incorporated within the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, and I think most justices on the Supreme Court believe that to be the case.Now, there are still very hard questions about what that liberty consists of. I think most justices of the Supreme Court do, at this point, fully accept the Griswold holding, which suggested that a couple’s ability to use contraceptives ought to be up to that couple, that the government could not appropriately interfere with that decision, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of liberty. But the Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment surely does give rise to some real disagreement in other cases, the extent to which that sphere extends. Those are one, but not the only kind of cases in which there are hard questions to be determined by the court.Just another very different kind of case which raised this to me recently—I mean, it shows the varying contexts in which these difficult questions involving constitutional principles can occur—is a case that I argued recently called Holder v. The Humanitarian Law Project, which involved this question of the application of the material support statute that Congress passed to combat terrorism as to certain kinds of expressive activities, certain kinds of—assistance to terrorist organizations that took the form of speech.And when I was arguing that case I was subject to questions, and the opposing lawyer also was subject to questions from all the justices, that all the justices clearly thought that this was an incredibly hard case because it involved very hard, but competing, legal values: the value of free speech on the one hand and the value, really, of protecting and defending our country on the other.And, you know, that’s a case in which the—this clash of constitutional principles can occur, in which—in which reasonable judges could reasonably disagree about the results. So—so to say that something is law all the way down, which is absolutely the case, that it would be completely improper for a judge to import personal, or moral, or political preferences into the occasion. But that’s not to say that law is robotic. It’s not to say that everything is easy in the world of constitutional law, or indeed of statutory law.

If you say so. 

Well, Senator Coburn, I suppose what I would want to say at this point is that the way I would vote as a legislator with respect to any or all of those issues is—— 

Can I interrupt you on that one, too? 

Well, I suppose a few comments, Senator Coburn. Let me take on just a couple of the particulars, and then maybe make a more general comment. You said, as Solicitor General, I advocated the use of—of foreign law in some circumstances. I do just want to make clear that what I said in those—those questions—— 

Well, I think, Senator Coburn, with all respect, that if you look at the question and you look at the answer, I was speaking in my role as an advocate, saying that the primary consideration of an advocate is to count to five and to try to do the best the advocate can to ensure that the position that the advocate has taken will prevail. 

As an advocate, to the extent that I think that foreign law arguments will help the government’s case, then I will use those foreign law arguments, is what I—— 

Senator Coburn, I think for the most part I wouldn’t try to convince you of that because I don’t think that foreign law is appropriate as precedent or as an independent basis if support, you know, in the vast majority of legal questions. Now, I suggested to you a few that specifically might reference international considerations, such as, you know, the right to receive Ambassadors or something like that. Even there, I think the citations would not be a precedent. They would not have binding weight of any kind. But they might be relevant to interpretation of——

Well, I think I agree with you on that, Justice—Senator Coburn.[Laughter.] 

Well, Senator Coburn, let me give you an example. I’m not sure if it was an example I used before or not, but in the First Amendment context, which is a context I’ve—I’ve—I’ve written about a good deal, it’s fairly clear that the First Amendment doctrine that’s been established over 100 years departs significantly from the original intent of the Framers. And here’s one example, is that I think that the Framers would never have dreamed that the First Amendment would in any way protect people against libel suits, that the First Amendment had anything to do with libel. So when the court said, in New York Times v. Sullivan, that a public figure could not sue the New York Times and claim damages for libel without meeting a very high bar, without meeting the so called ‘‘actual malice’’ standard, I think that was something that the Framers would not have understood.

Well, I think that their—— 

I think the—I’m sorry for interrupting. I think that the historic evidence is very clear that the Framers didn’t think that the First Amendment at all interfered with libel suits. Now, over time, as—as—as courts have applied the First Amendment to different contexts, to different circumstances, have seen different factual problems, have had to consider different cases, I think that the court sensibly thought that the principles that are embodied in the First Amendment could not be protected unless the decision in New York Times v. Sullivan was issued, unless the—— 

Well—— 

Well, the court can, but it’s a very high bar. 

It—the court can change, can overturn a ruling, but it’s a very high bar. The precedent—— 

Well, that—that—that it has to be a very extraordinary circumstance or a very unusual circumstance for a court to overturn a precedent, and the usual circumstances that are mentioned are where the precedent has become completely unworkable, where it’s clear that the precedent just is producing massively inconsistent results or—— 

It did, Senator Coburn. I think that—— 

You know—— 

Senator Coburn, I think what I’m trying to say is that courts appropriately look to both kinds, both keys to constitutional interpretation, that courts appropriately look to original intent, that courts appropriately look to precedent, and that it depends on the provision of the Constitution, it depends on the case, it depends on the issue as to whether—which—as to which one ofthose is most helpful, and that it’s a pragmatic approach, looking case by case, to try to figure that question out.And I think what I’m saying—I would say two things about it: it’s both extremely descriptive of what the court has done, that the court in——

Historically speaking and currently. The second point I would make is that, in fact, when the chief justice was sitting here, Chief Justice Roberts, he stated the same thing, the same principle that I’m trying to state, is that one should approach the question of constitutional interpretation pragmatically, without a single, over-arching theory, without something that says you always look to the specific original intent, or you always look to something else, that sometimes the original intent controls and other times it may be unknowable or it may be far removed from the current problems we face. 

Senator Coburn, I don’t disagree with you that judging requires judgment. 

And—— 

Senator Coburn, my—the advocate’s hat that I was referring to was not a political hat, it was the hat that I wear as Solicitor General of the United States, representing the interests of the United States. That has nothing to do with my own political views. It has to do with a long and historic tradition that the Solicitor General’s Office has of representing the long-term interests of the U.S. Government. 

Senator Coburn, that hat has not been on for many years. [Laughter.] Ms. KAGAN. Senator Coburn, I know that, you know, some people have said, oh, she’s a political person. I’ve had a 25-year career in the law. Of that 25-year career, 4 were spent in the Clinton White House. This was a period of time that I am proud of and that I feelas though, you know, I helped to serve the American people for President Clinton.But this is by no means the major part of my legal career. The major part of my legal career has been as a scholar and teacher of constitutional and administrative law, has been, you know, teaching, by this point, many thousands of students, has been writing about constitutional and administrative law issues.

You promise? 

Because it’s getting late. 

Well, I hope that they would listen to this hearing and come away with that view, come away with a person who believes that it’s—it’s all about law when you put on a judge’s robe. It’s not about politics, it’s not about policy, it’s all about law and making your best judgments about what the law require. And that is the pledge that I said was the only pledge that I would make yesterday and—and—and I’ll make it again now. But I think it’s consistent with—with—with the way I’ve approached my life, in a fashion that respects the rule of law, in a fashion that’s temperate and respectful of other people’s views, and, you know, with respect, which I don’t think is partisan in the kinds of ways that a few people have suggested. 

Sounds like a dumb law. [Laughter.] 

But I think the question of whether it’s a dumb law is different from whether the question of whether it’s constitutional, and—and—and I think that courts would be wrong to strike down laws that they think are—are senseless just because they’re senseless. 

Senator Coburn, I think—— 

I’m sorry, Senator. Where is this from that you’re reading? I’m sorry. 

OK. 

I have. 

It’s a great book. 

Well, Senator, first, let me say about the Federalist Paper quote that you read, that it is absolutely the case that the judiciary’s job is to, you know, in Marbury v. Madison’s famous phrase, to say what the law is and to make sure—I think I’ve— I’ve talked about it as policing the constitutional boundaries as— and making sure that Congress doesn’t go further than the Constitution says it can go. It doesn’t violate individual rights and also doesn’t act outside its enumerated authorities. We live in a—in a— in a government in which Congress—Congress’ authorities are enumerated in Article 1 of the Constitution, and Congress can’t act except under one of those heads of authority.Now, as I talked about with Senator Cornyn, the Commerce Clause has been interpreted broadly. It’s been interpreted to apply to regulation of any instruments or instrumentalities or channels of commerce, but it’s also been applied to anything that would substantially affect interstate commerce.It has not been applied to non-economic activities, and that’s the teaching of Lopez and Morrison, that the court—that the Congress can’t regulate non-economic activities, especially to the extent that those activities have traditionally been regulated by the States, and I think that that would be the question that the court would ask with respect to any case of this kind.But—but I do want to sort of say again, you know, we can come up with sort of, you know, just ridiculous-sounding laws, and the— and the—and the principle protector against bad laws is the political branches themselves. And I would go back, I think, to Oliver Wendell Holmes on this. He was this judge who lived, you know, in the—in the early 20th century. Hated a lot of the legislation that was being enacted during those—those years, but insisted that if the—if the people wanted it, it was their right to go hang themselves.

Now, that’s not always the case, but—but—but there is substantial deference due to political—— 

Well, Senator Coburn, I—I feel as though the principles that I’ve given you are the principles that the court should apply with—— 

Well, Senator Coburn, I—I guess, a few points. The first, is I think that there are limits on the Commerce Clause of the ones I suggested, which are the ones that are articulated, were articulated by the court in Morrison and in Lopez, which are primarily about non-economic activity and Congress not being able to regulate non-economic activity.I guess the second point I would make, is I do think that very early in our history, and especially I would look to Gibbons v. Ogden, where Chief Justice Marshall did, in the first case about these issues, essentially read that clause broadly and provide real deference to legislatures and provide real deference to Congress about the scope of that clause. Not that the clause doesn’t have any limits, but that deference should be provided to Congress with respect to matters affecting interstate commerce.And I guess the third point is just to say that I think the reason for that is—is that $1.6 trillion deficit may be an enormous problem. It may be an enormous problem, but I don’t think it’s a problem for courts to solve. I think it’s a problem for the political process to solve.

Some of the others? [Laughter.] If it is some of the others, I definitely want to take a break. If it is one of the others, we can do that. 

Well, Senator Cardin, I think that the Constitution is a kind of genius document in that while certain of its provisions are quite specific and, you know, it just doesn’t matter how times and circumstances change. We still have a Senate and we still have a House of Representatives and they’re still elected the same way and all manner of things like that that the Framers and then in subsequent amendments and especially with respect to the Civil War amendments, the Fourteenth—Thirteenth and Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments wrote some provisions broadly, generally. And this goes back to what Chief Justice Roberts said in that quote that you mentioned.And I think actually if I remember it correctly, Chief Justice Roberts said, ‘‘it would be wrong to give general provisions a crabbed interpretation.’’ That the point of these general provisions is to ensure that the principles that the Framers held so dear or that the ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment held so dear, that those principles would continue to apply throughout the ages for our posterity.And that’s so with respect to, you know, a number of ways in which the government can deprive people of equal protection of the laws or violate people’s liberty.

Senator, I hope and I know that Brown v. Board of Education and the principles that Brown v. Board of Education set forth are still relevant today and they’re the principles that the Equal Protection Clause has set forth. And the idea of equality under law is a fundamental American ideal, a fundamental American value or fundamental American constitutional value. And one of the Court’s most important missions is to ensure that that value remains strong over time.

Senator Cardin, you raised the question of the scope of Congress’s Section 5 power; Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment which gives Congress the ability to enforcement the Fourteenth Amendment. And the scope of that power has been an issue in several recent cases. In the case of Bernie, which I believe Senator Specter referred to earlier, the Court said that it wanted to distinguish between Congress’s ability to enforce—to remedy Fourteenth Amendment violations and also to prevent Fourteenth Amendment violations on the one hand, which was appropriate, and on the other hand what the Court found in Bernie was not appropriate, was that Court acting under that Section Five power to change that constitutional rights that had been found by the Court. So that’s the line that the Court has developed in Bernie and subsequent cases which is, Congress clearly has the authority to remedy and to prevent Fourteenth Amendment violations, but doesn’t have the authority essentially on its own to change the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

And I should say, of course, the Fifteenth Amendment has its own enforcement provision and the Voting Rights Act was passed under that enforcement provision. I think it’s undeniable that the Voting Rights Act has been a major historic achievement for this nation.There, of course, may be a case that will come before the Court on the question of the constitutionality of certain provisions or the Voting Rights Act generally. That case—that issue was potentially before the Court last year. The Court did avoid it and resolved the case on statutory grounds. It was a case that the Solicitor General’s Office filed a brief on in strong support of the Voting Rights Act. But it’s not likely to be the last time that the Court will consider those issues. And Congress clearly has an important role in thisarea and the exact scope of that role is going to be addressed in future cases.

Well, Congress certainly has as broad authority under the Constitution to enact legislation involving protection of the environment. And I think that when Congress enacts such legislation the job of the Courts is to construe it consistent with Congressional intent.

Well, Senator Cardin, I’ve pretty consistently said that I don’t want to, you know, grade, or give a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down on particular Supreme Court cases. I do think that with respect to any statute, discrimination statutes, or any other, that the job of the Court is to construe the legislation as Congress meant for the legislation to be construed. And that’s difficult sometimes, but that’s the goal is to make sure that the Court is not doing, you know, deciding a case in a way in which, you know, it would like the statute to read, that the Court is deciding the case according to the way Congress wanted the statute to be applied.

Well, the policy decision, Senator Cardin, is up to Congress. And the questions that might come before the Court are questions if they’re statutory in nature, they would be appropriately addressed by the Court asking what Congress intended.

Senator Cardin, this is one of the things I worked hardest on at Harvard along with a great many other people. And I think we had some significant successes which is good because the need is so vast in this area that there is so much need for legal services, you know, of all different kinds. Of people who have housing problems or have employment problems, or who have problems accessing health care in ways that they need it, in all kinds of ways in which a lawyer can help them and, you know, in which this country should be able to work out a system in which such help can be provided.And as you said, we very much expanded the clinical programs at Harvard during the time of my deanships. We also expanded the other kinds of pro bono opportunities open to Harvard Law School students. I think the numbers are more than double the number of clinical placements during the time that I was dean. And the pro bono work that was done by Harvard Law School students more than doubled during that time as well. So that 40-hour a week requirement that you mentioned—40-hour by graduation requirement that you mentioned, we had students who had performed 2,000 hours of pro bono by the time they graduated. And I think that the average amount of pro bono that was done by our students by the time they graduated was something like 500 hours, sort of ten times the amount that we required of them.And I think that that’s because what they discovered was this incredibly meaningful part of being a lawyer that you can provide real services to people who need them that you can make a difference in the world, that you can make a difference in the lives of ordinary human beings. And I think, you know, sometimes you can sit in the law school classroom and not know exactly how it all matters in the world. And then you get into one of these clinics and you do this kind of work and you see how it matters and you see how lawyers can truly benefit people.

Well, we can surely do better. And I think the Justices—you know, the question of what the Justices say, and how the Justices approach these big questions about the legal profession is something that I would want to talk with my colleagues about if the Senate sees fit to confirm me. But I think that there’s got to be a role for Supreme Court Justices given the positions that191 they have, given the visibility that they have to try to work for appropriate—to try to make sure that the practice of law, the legal profession really lives up to the ideals that it has.Senator Leahy. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Cardin. Solicitor General Kagan, I’ve been involved in hearings either as a member or conducting them for 35 years of various judicial nominees. I can’t remember when anybody’s been asked such a wide variety of questions or answered them as forthrightly as you have. And I know it’s been a long and tiring day. I think the best thing to do for us is to break now, come back—unless you want to override that? Ms. KAGAN. No, that’s good. [Laughter.] Senator Leahy. I was looking there, I was going to say, don’t call my bluff right now, I want to go home too. [Laughter.] Senator Leahy. We will come back in here at 9 tomorrow morning. I’ve had a lot of discussions with Senator Sessions who is actually wonderful to work with. I mean, he has to protect, on his side, but we really do try to work on schedules. We, because of the death of Senator Byrd and the changes that’s made, it’s also making in changes in what we might do. It’s one of the reasons why we went as late as we did. And I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for being responsive to that. So, please get a good night’s rest. I’m going to try to do the same. Senator Sessions, I hope you can too. And we stand in recess. [Whereupon, at 7:05 p.m., the Committee was recessed.]THE NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESWEDNESDAY, JUNE 30, 2010U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9 a.m., in room SH– 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Leahy, Kohl, Feinstein, Feingold, Specter, Schumer, Durbin, Cardin, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Kaufman, Franken, Sessions, Hatch, Grassley, Kyl, Graham, Cornyn, and Coburn. 

Good morning. 

Thank you. 

I do agree with that, Senator Whitehouse. It is what I tried to express in my opening statement on Monday and in much of my testimony yesterday. 

Senator Whitehouse, I think that is said very well. The doctrine of precedent is in large part a doctrine of constraint that ensures that improper considerations, improper factors will not come into judicial decisionmaking, that ensures that courts will decide every case on the law. It is also a doctrine of humility. It says that even if a particular Justice might think that a particular result is wrong, that that Justice actually should say to herself, ‘‘Maybe I am wrong,’’ and maybe the greater wisdom is the one that has been built up through the years by many judges in many cases.So precedent is a doctrine of humility, and it is very much what you said it is, a doctrine of constraint, a doctrine that binds courts and judges to the law.

Senator Whitehouse, that is correct. Respect for precedent and judicial restraint more generally are necessary for the reason you said, that the courts themselves have not been elected by anybody. There is no political accountability from the American citizenry. And there are precious few ways in which the legislature and the President can or should interfere with their function. They ought to be independent. But that places on them a responsibility which is also to be restrained.

As far as I know, the precedent had not changed under Leegin, but, Senator Whitehouse, you will excuse me, I am not an antitrust expert, so I do not know whether there was any lead-up to Leegin.

I think that that is mostly—— 

Senator Whitehouse, it is a hard question you pose because, on the one hand, every judge, every Justice has to do what he or she thinks is right on the law. You would not want the judicial process to become in any way a bargaining process or a logrolling process. You would not want people to trade with each other, you know, ‘‘You vote this way, and I will vote that way, and then we can get some unanimous decisions.’’

Every judge has to do what he or she thinks the law requires. But, on the other hand, there is no question, I think, that the Court is served best and our country is served best when people trust the Court as an entirely non-political body, when people look to the Court as doing what we know it ought to be doing, which is deciding cases that come before it on the best possible reading of the law. And I think—— 

Well, one of the benefits of narrow decisions generally—and there are a number of them, but one of the benefits of narrow decisions is that they enable consensus to a greater degree than broad, far-reaching decisions. And that is generally a benefit for the judicial process and for the country as a whole to try to reach consensus on what it is possible to reach consensus on consistent with the law. 

Senator Whitehouse, I want to make it clear that I am not agreeing to your characterizations of the current Court. I think that that would be inappropriate for me to do. 

And I am sure that everybody up there is acting in good faith. I do believe that one of the benefits of narrow decisions, of approaching one case at a time and in each case trying to think of the narrowest way to decide the case, is to enable consensus.And consensus is in general a very good thing for the judicial process and for the country.

And I think what a judge should do is not to think about—you know, ‘‘Over the long haul, I want the law to move in this direction.’’ I think what a judge should do is to take one case at a time and——

Well, I can only tell you what I think. 

Senator Whitehouse, I am going to insist again, I am not characterizing the Court or any of the Justices on the Court, and just to say what I think is the right approach to judicial decisionmaking. And I think it is—the right approach is to take one case at a time, to not be looking down the road and trying to figure out in what direction the law generally should go and how that case is going to lead to another case or—— 

Well, I do not think that—what I am most trying to make clear is that I do not think that any such agendas are the way anybody should conduct their business. 

And—— 

Well, findings of fact are usually made in the district court, in the trial court, or with respect to other kinds of cases, of course, fact finding can be done by Congress. But appellate courts do not make findings of fact, do not have the competence to make findings of fact, so for the most part rely on the findings of fact made in other institutions. 

Well, I talked before about my argument in Citizens United, and, of course, I approached that argument as an advocate for the U.S. Government, defending that statute and trying to defend it as vigorously as I possibly could. And certainly a large part of my argument was to urge the Court to defer to Congress’ very extensive fact finding on this subject. And it was extensive. It occurred over many years, and——

I think that what the Court was saying on the other hand was that this was a case in which political speech, paramount speech entitled to paramount First Amendment protection was involved, and that the Government had failed to show that there was a compelling state interest that was narrowly tailored to the restriction——

Senator Whitehouse, I do think Congressional fact finding is very important and that courts should defer to it. It does not mean that fact finding is either necessary or sufficient. Sometimes Congress can make no findings of fact at all, and the Court should still defer to Congress. And, on the other hand, sometimes Congressional fact finding cannot save a statute, but in very significant measure, the courts should defer to Congressional fact finding, and they should do so because they should realize that it is Congress rather than courts that has the competence to engage in that kind of fact finding, to develop evidence, to call witnesses——

Courts in general have neither the competence nor the legitimacy to do fact finding in the way that Congress can do fact finding.

Senator Whitehouse, I think that the Chief Justice was not the first in that opinion to make the argument that if a precedent is hotly contested, in his words, has been subject to very continuing disagreement and dispute, that that weakens it as a precedent.Now, other courts at other times have said the opposite, that that should not function as a reason to weaken the precedent. So I think that there is—even prior to the Chief Justice’s statements, I think that there are competing statements, competing views on this question.I think——

I do believe, Senator Whitehouse, that it should be regarded with some caution. I think that the stronger reasons and the reasons that the Court more frequently relies upon to reverse precedent has to do with its workability and has to do with whether either legal doctrine or empirical facts have eroded the precedent. I do think that the Chief Justice made some points with respect to those issues as well in his concurring opinion. But in any event, I think that those are the two—the two more standard bases for deciding that a precedent really does have to be reversed.

I think it was, Senator Whitehouse. You know, we learn about the separation of powers system and how the three branches of Government are designed to check each other. But the Framers also had a very strong view that there was another check in the system, and that check was the people and that the institution that the people often functioned as part of was the jury. And to the Framers, the jury was an extremely important mechanism in checking the other branches of Government.

That is my understanding, Senator Whitehouse. 

I think, Senator Whitehouse, that the jury was an extremely important mechanism to the Framers, and it was a mechanism designed to check other institutions of Government.

I think certainly the Framers believed in an independent judiciary generally, and there is no question that within the judicial branch they thought that the jury played a very significant role.

Well, I do think the Court in Exxon was struggling with values on both sides. I would agree with that.

In that particular case, the Court held under a kind of maritime common law that punitive damages could go——

It became unpredictable that there was no civility in the system. 

Thank you, Senator. 

I did not see that. 

I wish you wouldn’t. 

Senator Klobuchar, I think it is correct in several important respects, but like all metaphors, it does have its limits. So let me start with the ways in which I think it is an apt metaphor. The first is kind of the most obvious, which is that you expect that the judge, as you expect the umpire not to have a team in the game—in other words, not to come onto the field rooting for one team or another. You know, if the umpire comes on and says, you know, I want every call to go to the Phillies, that is a bad umpire. Is that your team? [Laughter.] 

I was pointing to Senator Kaufman. I am sorry. And the same for the judge. So, you know, to the extent that what the umpire suggests that there has got to be neutrality, that there has got to be fairness to both parties, of course, that is right. The second thing that I think is right about the metaphor—and I think that this is what the Chief Justice most had in mind, if I remember his testimony correctly—is that judges should realize that they are not the most important people in our democratic system of Government. They have an important role. Of course, they do. We live in a constitutional democracy, not a pure democracy. And judges have an important role in policing the constitutional boundaries of our system and ensuring that governmental actors, other governmental actors do not overstep their proper role. But judges should recognize that that is a limited role and that the policymakers of this country and the people who make the fundamental decisions for this country are the people and their elected representatives, whether in Congress or in the executive branch. And I think that that is right, too, as I have tried to say on many occasions throughout these hearings.I suppose the way in which I think that the metaphor does have its limits—and I believe that this is in line with what Mr. Ayer was talking about—was that the metaphor might suggest to some people that law is a kind of robotic enterprise, that there is a kind of automatic quality to it, that it is easy, that we just sort of stand there and, you know, we go ‘‘ball’’ and ‘‘strike’’ and everything is clear-cut and that there is no judgment in the process. And I do think that that is not right, and it is especially not right at the Supreme Court level, where the hardest cases go and the cases that have been the subject of most disputes go.As to that, I think that there is—judges do in many of these cases have to exercise judgment. They are not easy calls. That does not mean that they are doing anything other than applying the law. I said yesterday on a couple of different occasions it is law all the way down. You know, you are looking at the text, you are looking at structure, you are looking at history, you are looking at precedent. You are looking at law and only at law, not your political preferences, not your personal preferences. But we do know that not every case is decided 9–0, and that is not because anybody is acting in bad faith. It is because those legal judgments are ones in which reasonable people can reasonably disagree sometimes. So in that sense, law does require a kind of judgment, a kind of wisdom, and there are frequently clashes of constitutional values. Senator White House talked about one such clash, but there are many of them. And judges have to, you know, listen to both sides and cast each argument in the best possible light, but sometimes they are not going to agree.

Senator Klobuchar, I guess I will start by just saying that that listening was the most important lesson. I was so struck when I read this statement by Justice Stevens about understanding before disagreeing, and he had said that about the Justice whom he clerked for. And I thought, you know, that is about the best thing that you can say about a person, that the person does listen and try to understand things from the other point of view before deciding to disagree, and, you know, maybe deciding not to disagree because of the listening and the understanding that hastaken place. So that is, I hope, something that I had to learn a little bit during my time as dean.But I guess otherwise—you know, Mr. Ayer said prudence and judgment. I do think that when you run an institution with, you know, many, many employees, with a big budget, with just, you know, lots of the kinds of problems that—any person who runs a business or runs an organization just knows the wide variety of things that come across your plate every day, and, you know, you exercise a lot of muscles when you do something like that, and they are muscles that I had never exercised before, and it gave me grounding in a lot of things that I otherwise would not have had grounding in. And it made me, I think, you know, very aware of other people, I think, in a way that maybe I would not have been had I been just a professor all my life, because so many people come to your office with just life problems, and you get exposure to, you know, so many different sorts of issues that people are struggling with and that people are confronting in their lives, and it becomes a little bit your life, too. And, you know, I hope that that made me a better person.

Well, first I will say that it has very much deepened my appreciation of the Court itself, and I hope that this was something that I conveyed in my opening statement, is that you go up there and you get to the podium, and there are nine people, and every single one of them is so prepared to talk about the case, so into the case, so engaged, obviously so smart, and so, I think, trying to get it right. And so I have developed a real appreciation for the Court through those oral arguments.What do I think is a good oral argument? I think you have to answer the judge’s questions. I think they are impatient when people try to give speeches or when people go up to the podium and just try to make their points. I have four points I want to make; I am going to make those points again and again and again. And the Justices, I think, they have your briefs, they have read your briefs, and, you know, the striking thing is that they really have read your briefs. They know your briefs. So they do not want to hear you repeat your briefs. What they want to hear you do is respond to their questions, and I think good advocates know that, and they know that even if it means going down a road that—you know, their great points are in some other direction, but it makes sense to go down the road that the Court wants you to go down, because that is what the Court is interested in, and it is only if you address the Justices’ real concerns that you are going to win your case.

Well, I again want to say what I said yesterday, is that let us just throw that piece of work in the trash, why don’t we? You know, that it was something that I wrote before I went to law school and did not know much, did not understand much about law, and certainly about the way judges should work.I just think every judge just has to be committed to the kind of principles of restraint that I have tried to talk about in this hearing, and every judge has to realize that the people of this country get to make the fundamental decisions about this country. And I do think that my experience working in other branches of Government, in the executive, and working a good deal with Congress, will remind me of that if anything were needed to remind me of that, because what I did take away from those experiences was really a profound respect for the political process and for how policy decisions are made. And not every single one of them looks pretty, and, of course, no single person is going to agree with every result that comes out of Congress or any other political institution. But I do believe that there is real wisdom in the American people, and that wisdom gets channeled through institutions like this one, and that in the main we are well served by our political institutions, and that even when we are not, it is just not up to courts to correct that.So, you know, I think that the experiences that I have had in government are good reminders of just the importance of the democratic branches of our Government in making the fundamental policy decisions that affect our country.

Senator Klobuchar, I should say it is an important question, but I will just say I think in the end I disagreed with Justice Stevens more than I agreed with him in that opinion.

But I do think it is sometimes a fair criticism, the criticism that Justice Stevens made, and it suggests something about maybe some decisions’ lack of connectedness to sort of facts on the ground. And I would say two things about that. The first is that courts have to be really attentive to the facts of a case, that courts cannot be sort of spinning legal doctrine irrespective of the facts in a case that have been presented to them, because the whole idea of courts in our system is that the courts are not deciding abstract legal questions. They are not just sort ofphilosophizing about proper legal approaches. They are deciding actual cases and controversies. And what it means to decide an actual case or controversy is to think about the application of law to facts, and what that requires is that you really understand the facts, that you really—that you delve through the record, that you get your absolute best sense of what the actual conditions and circumstances of the parties are. So that would be the first point I would make.I guess the second thing is actually that even going beyond that, that it is often an important part of principled judicial decisionmaking to take into account the actual consequences of a legal rule. And this appears in a number of different areas. I will give you one, which is procedural due process, the 14th Amendment. We are more used to talking in these hearings about the substantive due process aspect of the 14th Amendment, but the procedural due process aspect is very important. It is the set of requirements that say when an individual comes and challenges the Government, says the Government has denied me some benefit that the Government owes me. The question is what procedures is that person entitled to to make that challenge. And the test the Court uses is a very practical one. It says, well, if we gave you more procedures, how much would that increase the accuracy of our determinations? And, also, if you were wrongly deprived of some benefit, how much would that hurt you? And, also, what is the burden that these procedures are likely to impose on the Government? What is the actual cost that the Government is going to have to incur? And it balances those things, and that is an example of how in some areas the Court has, and I think appropriately, looked to the real world, the practical effects of a particular legal rule.

Yes. You are totally not talking about driving the results. This is anything but a results orientation in the way people sort of think, oh, I want this side rather than that side to win. That is inappropriate in every and all circumstance. But there are places in which the legal doctrine and even the constitutional doctrine does take into account practical effects.Just another quick example is Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases, where the Constitution speaks of unreasonable searches and seizures. And one of the things that the Court takes into account in deciding what is a reasonable search and seizure and what is an unreasonable search and seizure is some practical impacts on the people who are searched, but also very much on the police. You know, how can we create a set of—you know, how can we create a doctrine that the police will find to be workable so that they will know when to search and when not to search, when they have to get a warrant and when they do not have to get a warrant.

Well, I will not be able to get involved in this case. I am sure that there are other issues that will be coming down the road about the Confrontation Clause. I will try to steer clear of that.As you say, Senator Klobuchar, the U.S. Government did file a brief in that case, and it supported, whatever it was, 26 or 27 States which were concerned about the effects of the Court’s prior ruling on law enforcement and particularly were concerned about the ability of governments to present evidence—this was evidence of drug testing—without going to great expense and burden to get every lab analyst into the courtroom.

Yes. I think the Court just remanded the case back to the lower courts to decide it, and decided, you know, not to say anything more about this issue in that case. The Government had urged them to do so because of the kinds of practical issues you raise.I think the Court’s analysis now in this area does not focus on those practical questions. The Court’s analysis simply asks, says, Is the evidence in question testimonial, which an affidavit from a drug analyst would be? And if it is testimonial, the only way in which it can be admitted in court is if the person who has made the affidavit, who has written the affidavit is unavailable and was previously subject to cross-examination. So it is a pretty bright-line rule, and it has had the effects on States that you mentioned. But it is—the approach is now settled law, and I will say—I will say one thing about this. I think it sort of suggests something different about the judicial process that is a point I have been trying to emphasize.I think that the Justice who has been primarily responsible for this understanding of the Confrontation Clause. And it is an understanding of the Confrontation Clause, you know, that works well for criminal defendants.

Criminal defendants love this rule. Prosecutors do not like this rule.The person who has been most responsible for this approach is, I think, Justice Scalia, and I do not think that Justice Scalia is any great fan of—you know, if you gave him a criminal defendant and gave him a prosecutor and said, ‘‘Choose,’’ I do not—you know, I think we would know which way he would choose. It is actually a good example of where a person’s view of the law comes out a different way from, you know, which party they might want to have win. And that is a great thing for a judge to do. All judges, that should happen in their lives, that their view of the law leads them in a direction which, you know, if they were a legislator or if they— you know, they would not come out that way.

OK. I think people should be able to write anything that they want about me, and I do not think that I should be able to sue them for libel.[Laughter.] 

It has been a long time since I read that book review, but I think that the point that the book review was making was, on the one hand, what an iconic decision New York Times v. Sullivan is, how important it has been to the development of our First Amendment law, how vital it is to a system of free expression to have newspapers and other people who speak—it is not just newspapers, as you suggest. I mean, given the way the media has developed, there are so many different ways to express thoughts in our world now. And to have these speakers insulated from libel suits by people who are in this public sphere, who are public officials or who are public figures, and to have an extremely, extremely high bar before those people can recover for any libel that may have been done them.I guess the question that I was asking in that review—and I continue to think it is a real question—is how far should that go in the sense of—we should understand that libel can harm people, that reputational harm is real harm, and that people can suffer great damage from their reputations being inaccurately besmirched through utterly false statements.And I guess the question that I asked was whether there were some contexts where the person had not put themselves into the public sphere in any real way, where the person was, you know, a private actor trying to mind his or her own business and sort of became dragged into the spotlight and something terrible was said about that person in a way that had harmed that person. The law actually does treat that person somewhat differently in libel law, but the question I was asking was whether the balance had been struck appropriately in that sort of case, where the values of the First Amendment in uninhibited political speech are not so much evident, and where the personal harm can be great.It has been so many years since I read that article, I am not exactly sure how I came out on that question. But I think it is a real question, and even as we understand the absolute necessity for a kind of New York Times v. Sullivan sort of rule and for protection of speakers from libel suits, from defamation suits, even as we understand that, you know, we should also appreciate that people who did nothing to ask for trouble, who did not put themselves into the public sphere, can be greatly harmed by—when something goes around the Internet and everybody believes something false about a person, that is a real harm, and the legal system should not pretend that it is not.

Thank you. 

That is not what they tell me, you know. 

There is a huge difference, Senator Kaufman. In the Domestic Policy Council, I was an aide to President Clinton. I was carrying out—helping President Clinton to carry out his domestic policy goals and objectives. As you know, I worked on a variety of issues. I worked on education. I worked on public health, particularly tobacco. I worked on anti-crime measures. I worked on the measures involved in ending the old welfare system. I worked on a number of things. I am very proud of my service there. I think I contributed to doing some good things for people across this country. But it is an entirely different role. I was, you know, not primarily looking—there was a period of time in the White House where I was also a lawyer, but when I was a policy aide, I was not primarily looking at things as a lawyer. And even as a White House lawyer, you are a lawyer for a particular administration’s perspective and a lawyer for a President who is trying to achieve a certain set of goals. As a judge, you are on nobody’s team. As a judge, you are an independent actor, and your job is simply to evaluate the law and evaluate the facts and apply the one to the other as best, as most prudently, as most wisely as you can. You know, the greatness of our judicial system lies in its independence, and that means when you get on the bench, when you put on the robe, your only master is the rule of law. And, you know, regardless what political administration you might have worked for in the past—and there are many Justices on the Court who have worked for—either for Congress or for the Executive, but just like all of them have, I would, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, you know, put on that robe and be independent and not favor any political party. 

Sandra Day O’Connor was an elected official herself. That is true. I will give you another example. It is a great example. He is actually one of my favorite figures in Supreme Court history, who is Robert Jackson. Robert Jackson was such an executive branch man. He had had a series of positions in the executive branch, including in my role, including as Solicitor General and Attorney General, and he was also in a way that very few Justices— well, a few, but he was very close personally to Franklin Roosevelt. Even before he had occupied this set of positions, they were real friends. And Justice Jackson, you know, he got to the Court, and the executive branch never counted on his vote. Quite the opposite, that he was as independent as they come. And, you know, the case that everybody knows about, of course—and it is kind of the iconic case—is what he did in Youngstown, where President Truman closes the steel mills and says that this is vital for the national security of the country, and the question comes to the Court. And I think for sure President Truman must have thought, Oh, well, you know, Robert Jackson will vote with me. And Robert Jackson didnothing of the sort. Robert Jackson voted against the ability of the Executive to take an action like that and wrote one of the—I think probably the strongest opinion ever written on the subject of executive power.So, you know, that is the kind of independence that I think a judge has to show, and I think—I think it is sort of a natural consequence of assuming that position.

That is true, Senator Kaufman. I will push back a little bit, though, and say that the antitrust area is a kind of special area with respect to statutory interpretation that courts have been considered to have more common law power in this area because of the breadth with which and the generality with which the antitrust statutes are framed.

Congress surely could have stepped in at any point and, indeed, could do so now.

I think it is a longstanding principle, a very well accepted one, and I do agree with it, that stare decisis is at its highest in the area of statutory interpretation. And the answer is what you just gave, that, look, if the Court got it wrong, Congress can change it. And if Congress has not changed it, it suggests something, at least, about whether the Court got it wrong. And that is a very different kind of situation than when the Court makes a constitutional ruling, where the Court makes a constitutional ruling and everybody has to live with it and abide by it regardless whether it is wrong. Nobody can change it. So if it is really wrong or really unworkable, it is up to the courts. Not so with respect to statutes. 

Stare decisis is a major consideration, and it is at its height where statutes are concerned.

Well, I think that the factors would be the same as in a constitutional case, but then there would be—you would really, really, really have to find those factors. So the factors would be the workability of the precedent. If the precedent has just proved unworkable in the sense that courts struggle to apply the test and come up with widely differing results, it produces a kind of erraticism and instability in the law. That would be one.Another is if the precedent has been eroded over time, and that might be because it is eroded by other doctrinal change. Let us say one precedent is relied on in three other cases, and then two of those other cases have been reversed themselves, so the precedent is standing on nothing in the way of doctrine. That is an important consideration.Still a third is if the facts change such that a precedent becomes sort of silly, and the best example I can give you of that is in the search and seizure context. There used to be a rule that said something was only a search if there was an actual trespass on physical property. And then a case came along—it was the Katz case— which involved surveillance issues. And the Court said, well, wait a minute, why should we require a physical trespass on property? We have all these new technological ways of essentially invading people’s privacy and searching them without doing the trespass, the sort of technology has overtaken the precedent, and that would be a situation in which the Court might reverse a precedent.So those are generally the circumstances in which that happens—lack of workability or a kind of erosion because of doctrinal change or because of change in factual circumstances in the world.But as I indicated before, you really, really have to be sure that one of those things exists, even more than in the constitutional context, when you are dealing in the statutory realm.

I think it generally is. I think it generally is, just in the sense that it is at least true that the more times that a precedent is affirmed and reaffirmed and reaffirmed and nobody has found anything wrong with it, and to the contrary, maybe people have specifically reconsidered the precedent and said, yes, we think that this is a good precedent, that would be a factor.

That is correct. 

Well, the Court did. 

I do not remember the exact phrasing, Senator Kaufman. 

The question of whether Austin and a part of McConnell should be reversed. 

Well, it is unusual. It is not unheard of. It has happened in other cases as well. 

It is unusual. 

I think that the question that the Court posed had been in the initial complaint but had then been abandoned by the party’s in the case. In the briefs that had been filed in the Court, the question and the argument came back in a few paragraphs, but that it was not the focus of the party’s argument. 

Well, I think that there is a longstanding rule—it is a sensible rule; it is a good rule for the judicial system—that to the extent one can, one should avoid constitutional questions, and that means that if one can, one should decide a case on statutory grounds. Now, that is not always possible. 

Sometimes the statute does not allow it. You cannot make up a statute or recast a statute to make it mean something that it obviously does not mean just in order to avoid a constitutional question. But to the extent that it is reasonable to construe a statute in a way that avoids a constitutional question, it is, I think, a longstanding practice of judicial restraint to do so.

Well, it certainly was not consistent with Austin or with the part of McConnell that was reversed. There was clearly an argument in the case as to what the other precedents held——

Well, I think results-oriented judging is pretty much the worst kind of judging there is. I mean, the worst thing that you can say about a judge is that he or she is resulted-oriented. It suggests that a judge is kind of picking sides irrespective of what the law requires and that that is the absolute antithesis of what a judge should be doing, that the judge should be trying to figure out as best she can what the law does require and not going in and saying, you know, I do not really care about the law, you know, this side should win. So to be a results-oriented judge is the worst kind of judge you can be. 

Senator Kaufman, in fact, this question did come up at the oral argument in the case, and I was asked a question about it, and I responded in a similar kind of way, that they could not do it through the—they could not spend through the corporation itself, but that they could spend individually. 

Well, it is certainly the way—when I argued the case—that I understood the Congressional Record, that when Ilooked at the Congressional Record and tried to portray to the Court what the Congressional Record was all about, that it was all about larger corporations and trade unions and the way in which they could inject money into the political system, and thereby change the outcomes of the political system.

Senator Kaufman, the argument that the Government made, which was based on Congress’ own record, suggested that there was significant potential for corrupting influence in that way.

Yes, and the appearance of corruption, and that has been something that the Court’s decisions, Buckley v. Valeo has made clear is a compelling governmental interest, preventing either corruption or the appearance of corruption.Now, you know, the Citizens United Court found that the Government had not proved its case sufficiently and it had not shown to the high level that is necessary in the political speech context that these dangers would exist. And that is settled precedent going forward.

Got it. Yes. 

In this class of maritime suit, yes, I believe that that is right. 

Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause, and certainly most regulation of financial markets that I could think of would substantially affect interstate commerce. It does not mean to say that there could not be something unconstitutional in this area as in any other, but the standard test is whether activity substantially affects interstate commerce. There are limits on non-economic activity, but presumably the regulation of financial markets would not be that.

I do not think it should at all, and I think—I guess I talked yesterday about Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was the Justice who in the early 20th century was most adamant that the Court was going down the wrong road in striking down a whole series of pieces of economic legislation. And what most people, I think, do not know about Justice Holmes is that he thought all this economic legislation was dumb. I mean, he was not in favor of these various pieces of progressive legislation for the most part, and, you know, notwithstanding that, he said, look, I might think that this legislation is unwise, but this is a choice for the American people; and, you know, if I am right and it turns out that they have done unwise things, they will correct it.And I think that that is what the attitude of judicial restraint— judicial deference to the democratic process really is. It does not matter whether you like the legislation or not. Not to say that courts do not have an important role. Courts do have an important role in policing those constitutional boundaries. But in fulfilling that role, you know, courts should realize that they are not the principal players in the game.

Well, I tried to do a lot because I think it is one of those things that, you know, public service—it is one of those things that, on the one hand, what our students find is that theydo good for other people and that they also create meaningful professional lives for themselves. So working with quite a large number of people at Harvard, I think some of whom are here in the rows behind me, we tried to very much increase clinical opportunities to give people a sense of what it actually meant to do public service. I tried to use, you know, the bully pulpit whenever I could to talk about the importance of these issues. And I think we had good results, that the number of students who did clinical work in the law school went up very dramatically, that the number of students—I was speaking with Senator Cardin yesterday about our pro bono requirement, which says you have to do 40 hours of work in public service kind of activities, helping people who cannot afford legal services to get necessary legal services. You have to do 40 hours a week—excuse me, 40 hours by the time you graduate. Forty hours by the time you graduate. And students were doing an average of 500-some hours, so 10 times what they had to do. And I think that that was because they found it meaningful for themselves to see how their legal profession—how their legal training could be used to help real people solve real problems, and I think it was great for the surrounding community. Harvard Law School is now the second largest provider of legal services in the State of Massachusetts, and I think that that is something that the school can legitimately be proud of.

Well, Senator Kaufman, I think that the role of the Court is to provide a level playing field for all Americans, and this is what I tried to convey in my opening statement, that the greatness of the Court and the greatness of the Court historically has been that no matter who you are, your arguments are considered with the same kind of respect, your arguments are given the same kind of attention, and if you are right on the law—and you have to be right on the law. But if you are right on the law, it does not matter that your opponent has a great deal more wealth or more power than you do.And one of the things that I found remarkable in my time as Solicitor General is I walk into that Court and I represent the Government. And people might think that the Government is kind of favored in the Court, but anything but. You know, the Government is given just as hard a time as every other litigant. In fact, I think some Justices actually think it is okay to give the Government a harder time. And I think that that is fine because the Government does have, you know, a lot of resources and a lot of ability up there.And so every single person who comes before the Court has to be treated equally, and every single claim has to be considered fairly, and whether you are a rich person or a poor person, whatever your race, whatever your religion, whatever your belief, you are entitled to the same kind of respect. And I think that the greatness of our court system historically has been that you have generally gotten it.

Well, what I was trying to say, Senator Kaufman, is really what I just said to you, that Justice Marshall lived in a time and he lived in a world and he lawyered in a world in which many doors were closed to him. And as he was trying to eradicate Jim Crow segregation, he was not met with much—you know, you could walk into the State houses and you could walk into Congress and you could walk into the White House, and there were not a whole lot of people who were willing to listen to the kinds of claims he was making, just claims for racial equality.And I think what he—the reason he revered the courts was that step by step by step over the years he did find success in the courts because the courts were willing to listen to those claims in a way that nobody else in the governmental system was. And he made great progress and did great justice of going to the courts and arguing his cases there and expecting no more—expecting no more than that the courts would rule on him if he was right on the law and on the meaning of the Constitution, but step by step by step, succeeding in that mission.

Well, Senator Franken, the most important thing in interpreting any statute—in fact, the only thing that matters in in-terpreting any statute is Congress’ intent. Congress gets to make the laws under Article I of the Constitution, and what the Court should be doing in applying those laws is trying to figure out what Congress meant and how Congress wanted the laws to be applied. And that is the only thing that the Court should be doing.Now, sometimes that can be a difficult task. New situations come up. The statutory language, it is not clear how the statutory language applies to those new situations. Or sometimes Congress might simply not have thought of particular situations. Language is by necessity inexact. And so there are going to be cases which——

Well, I would say this. I would say where the text is clear a court should go with the text. Where the text clearly covers some situation, the Court should do that. The Court should not rewrite the law.

Well, I think if the text is clear, Congress should not—the Court should not rewrite the law. But where the text is ambiguous, which often happens——

Yes. I mean, the first step—— 

Well, the Court surely would be helped if Congress spoke as precisely and exactly and as comprehensively as it could in all situations. You know, there are some instances where the Court just has legitimate difficulty trying to figure out what Congress intended, and where judges—all of whom agree that what they should be doing is doing what Congress intended—have difficulty determining that or disagree about what that means. And certainly to the extent that Congress can make its intentions clear in legislation and can specifically spell out how it intends for the law to operate, Congress ought to do so. And, of course, you know, to the extent that the Court gets something wrong with respect to a statute—and this has happened, you know, many times in recent years and in prior years as well. To the extent that the Court gets something wrong, of course, Congress can come back and change it and make it clear that the Court got it wrong and also use it as an opportunity even to make clear its intentions with respect to a general area of law. 

Well, I do agree with that very strongly, Senator Franken, and if I might, if I might just return to this question of statutory interpretation that you started off with, because I did want to make clear that when a text is ambiguous, which, you know, frequently happens—which frequently happens—that I think that the job of the courts is to use whatever evidence is at hand to understand Congress’ intent. And that includes exploration of Congress’ purpose by way of looking at the structure of the statute, by way of looking at the title of the statute, by way of looking at when the statute was enacted and in what circumstances, and by way of looking at legislative history.Now, I think courts have to be careful about looking at legislative history and make sure that what they are looking to is reliable. But courts should not at all exclude signs of congressional intent and should really search hard for congressional intent when the text of the statute itself is unclear.

Well, I suspect that—I do not know the case very well. I suspect that Justice Kennedy may have meant that he thought that the text was clear and, therefore, the legislative history was not something that should appropriately be explored. But I am just guessing on that.

OK.[Laughter.] 

It is not the first time in my life. 

Well, Senator Franken, when I argued the case, I thought that the strongest argument of the Government was the very substantial record that Congress puts together, which I think reflected the sense of the American people that these monies from these actors spent in this form could have substantial corrupting effect on the political process. And that is the argument that the Government made to the Court. Now, as I have indicated before, I approach this case as an advocate, not as a judge, and there are certainly strong arguments on the other side as well. And in particular, there is the fact that political speech is the highest form of speech under the First Amendment entitled to the greatest protection, and that the courts should be wary of Congress regulating in this area in such a way as to protect incumbents to help themselves. And I think that those are strong arguments. The argument that the Government made in defense of the statute as against that was really an argument about the strength ofthe governmental interest involved in this case in preventing corruption from this kind of expenditure of money.

That is certainly true. It is a basic postulate of the way we run our judicial system that the Court does not issue advisory opinions, that the Court does not issue opinions on anything except what is necessary to decide a concrete case or controversy before it.

I do agree with that, Senator Franken. That, too, is a basic principle of our legal system. It is a requirement of—or it is a foundation stone of judicial restraint.

Yes, I do, Senator Franken, in part for the reasons I was discussing with Senator Whitehouse, that this leads to a kind of restrained decisionmaking in which consensus can be most easily achieved and appropriate and restrained outcomes most easily reached. 

Well, gosh, I do not know, Senator Franken. 

Okay. [Laughter.] 

I will guess none. 

Well, Senator Franken, Chevron says that where there is ambiguity in a Congressional statute—where there is not ambiguity, you just go with what the statute says; but where there is ambiguity, that an agency’s interpretation of what Congress intended for a statute to mean should receive deference from the courts. And the idea really is that the agency is better able to clarify that ambiguity because it has a kind of expertise in the area and also because it has real political accountability through the President, and the courts have neither expertise in one of these various technical subjects, nor do the courts have electoral legitimacy. The courts are by design cut off from the people. So for both competence reasons and legitimacy reasons, Chevron says, as between courts and agencies in interpreting unclear statutes, you should give the nudge to agencies, that courts should defer to their decisions. It is actually a Justice Stevens opinion. I think it is one of the most cited cases, maybe the most cited case in Supreme Court history. 

Senator Franken, as I indicated to Senator Feinstein, I have not read this opinion ever. I think that, you know, this might be one where—— 

You know, I have been an administrative law professor, and Chevron is actually something that I have written a good deal about, and I think I have written about it in a—beyond the fact that Chevron is obviously settled law, going forward, I have to say if you look at my writings on administrative law, you know that I am a sympathizer with Chevron for the kinds of reasons that I just suggested.

That is very good of you. 

Sure, Senator Sessions. I think that we have acted, I have acted, in the Solicitor General’s Office consistently with the responsibility, which I agree with you very much that I have, to vigorously defend all statutes, including the statute that embodies the don’t ask/don’t tell policy.So let’s take the Pietrangelo case first, which was the First Circuit case, where the First Circuit upheld the don’t ask/don’t tell policy. Mr. Pietrangelo brought a challenge to that decision. The question was, you know, he was challenging a decision that the government very much approved of, which was a decision that upheld the don’t ask/don’t tell policy. And we told the court in no uncertain terms not to take the case, and we defended the statute vigorously. We told the court not to take the case because the statute was constitutional.So in that Pietrangelo brief that I filed, and it’s a brief on which I’m counsel of record, the—the argument is made vigorously that the don’t ask/don’t tell statute is fully constitutional given the appropriate standard of review, and particularly given the deference that courts properly owe to the military.So the Pietrangelo brief is a brief—and again, I’m counsel of record on that brief—in which the U.S. Government vigorously defended the don’t ask/don’t tell policy—and statute, more importantly -and told the court not to take a case which challenged a decision upholding that statute.Now, as to the second matter, the Witt matter, as—as—as you said, the Witt matter is interlocutory in nature. And what that means, for people who aren’t familiar with these legal terms, is that it means that the case is in the middle and that the government can, after remand at a later stage, continue to defend the don’t ask/don’t tell statute in this very case.Now, we engaged in very serious discussions with the Department of Defense about the appropriate approach here in order to defend the don’t ask/don’t tell statute, because I agree with you, Senator Sessions, that the Ninth Circuit decision undercuts that statute. It makes it harder for the government to carry out its policies under that statute.And the question that we had to decide was whether to challenge that Ninth Circuit decision, which I think does—is in real tension with the don’t ask/don’t tell statute. Whether—the question we had to decide was whether to challenge that Ninth Circuit decision at an early stage or at a late stage of the case. It was a matter of timing. And we talked a good deal about this, of course, amongst ourselves, but also with the Department of Defense, and we decided that the better course was actually to wait on it and to accept the court’s remand. The case is not at all closed. Instead, the case is on remand in the—in the District Court to take that remand, and in the event that we didn’t win the case on remand or in the Ninth Circuit again, in that event, then have the option to, and presumably would, take the case to the Supreme Court to challenge the Ninth Circuit’s holding.And when we did this, we wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee. It’s called a 530 D letter, which is a letter which the Justice Department writes whenever there’s a moment at which it does not—does—does not contest a decision that is inconsistent with a Federal statute. We wrote a 530 D letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee and we basically laid out this explanation.We basically said, we still have the opportunity to approach the court and ask the court to take certiorari in this case, and we presume that we will use this opportunity if we don’t get the case dismissed in the District Court, but that we think it’s actually better to go to the District Court, to take the remand, and then to come back to the Supreme Court if it’s necessary to do so.And the reason that that approach was chosen was because we thought that it was—it would be better to go to the Supreme Court with a fuller record, and with a fuller record about the particular party involved, maybe more importantly, with a record that would show exactly what the Ninth Circuit was demanding that the government do.Because what the Ninth Circuit was demanding that the government do was, in the government’s view and particularly in DoD’s view, a kind of strange thing where the government would have to show, in each particular case, that a particular separation caused the military harm rather than to view it in general across the statute.One reason we thought that the remand would actually strengthen the case in the Supreme Court was because the remand would enable us to show what this inquiry would look like, what the Ninth Circuit’s—the inquiry that the Ninth Circuit demanded would look like, and to suggest to the Supreme Court, using the best evidence there was, how it was that this inquiry really would disrupt military operations.So that was our decision-making process. It was, as I say, a decision-making process that we wrote about to Congress when it occurred, and stated specifically that this was a timing issue for us,that we were not going to the Supreme Court at the earliest possible moment, but instead waiting.And I should just put one other factor into the mix which I left out along the way, which is that there is a Supreme Court presumption that cases should not be taken in an interlocutory posture, that instead the Supreme Court ought to—that the Supreme Court ought to wait and that parties ought to wait before asking the Supreme Court to take a case until the case is sort of well and truly over, when it’s not in the middle of things.Now, I don’t want to overstate that. That’s a presumption. It’s not a flat rule. It’s a presumption against interlocutory review, but it was something that we weighed in the balance. Here we had a presumption against interlocutory review and we had some good reasons for thinking that our case would be made stronger if we did not take the case in an interlocutory posture, but instead waited for the remand to be completed before we went to the court and asked the court to review the Ninth Circuit decision.

Gosh, I don’t think that I’ve expressed any views in my academic writing or anything I can think of on Lopez and Morrison. You know, I’ve given a lot of speeches in my life, but, you know, I can’t think of any place where I specifically addressed those issues. I think that they are settled law, that they are part of the jurisprudence of the Commerce Clause going forward.

I think I’ve actually used that phrase with respect to a number of cases which people have asked me about. Those are a couple, but there are——

I don’t mean any difference. What I mean to say when I use those phrases is, these are decisions of the court. They are decisions of the court that are entitled to all the weight that any decision of the court has as precedent going forward, that I have no thought, no agenda, no purpose, no—you know, remotely no plan to—to—to think about reversing any of them, that these are cases that I accept as decisions of the court going forward.

Senator Sessions, it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to bind myself with respect to any future case that came before me. It wouldn’t be appropriate for me in any case to say, oh, I promise that I’m going to take a case like that and do X, Y, Z with it. That wouldn’t be appropriate. 

Senator Hatch, I think you are wrong to be concerned about it. Let me first talk about the United States v. Stevens brief. It’s as hard case. Congress had passed a statute and it was a statute designed to deal with horrific acts of animal cruelty, including these things that I didn’t know existed, these crush videos.

But it was—it was a statute that was—I hesitate to criticize Congress’ work, but it was a statute that was not drafted with the kind of precision that made it easy to defend from a First Amendment challenge. And we thought that our best argument, really the only argument that we had, was to analogize the statute to other categories of expressive activity that the court had held were simply not protected by the First Amendment. And most notably, the two categories that we used in that—in that brief were obscenity and child pornography, and those are categories where I think the court has done this kind of categorical balancing that I spoke of—that, you know, we spoke of in the brief, where the court has said, look, when it comes to obscenity or child pornography—child pornography is—is an especially apt example because the harm that Congress was trying to get at here—what Congress was trying to do was to turn off the spigot of distribution so that these materials would not be made in the first place. That was the theory that the court used to say that child pornography could be regulated under the First Amendment, that if we shut down the mechanisms of distributing and—and this material, nobody would produce this material. That’s what Congress—that was clearly Congress’ focus in passing this animal cruelty statute. So what we tried to do, was to analogize this statute to the child pornography laws that the court had upheld in Ferber, and to say that the court should uphold this statute for the identical reason that it upheld the child pornography laws, that the court should realize the extraordinary harms of this—of this speech and should realize the way in which this regulation was really aimed at stopping the initial production, the initial horrific acts that went into the production of this speech. That was—that was the government’s view. It was a view that was accepted by Justice Aleto in the case. He was the only vote we got, but he essentially accepted that theory. I think it was a very hard case because it was—again, I hesitate to criticize Congress’ work, but another statute would have been easier to defend on First Amendment grounds, but we tried to do the best we could with it. 

I’m sorry. What they were able? 

Senator Hatch, I did believe that it was an equally effective substitute, that what our Office of Career Services does, they do a good job, but what they do is basically no more than to ensure that students know when a military—excuse me, when an employer of any kind is coming and to enable a student and the employer to hook up with each other. And that’s what our Office of Career Services do. They have upwards of 700–800 employers that come to our campus every year, and what the Office of Career Services does, is to make sure that students know when those 700– 800 employers are coming and where they’re going to be. 

And to make sure—— 

Senator Hatch, I appreciate that reasonable people can disagree about this issue, but I do think that the military, at all times, regardless whether it was—whether the Office of Career Services was sponsoring or the Veterans Association was sponsoring, had excellent access to our students. And over many years prior to my deanship, the Veterans Association had sponsored. The Department of Defense had thought that that sponsorship was fully adequate to their needs, and I think that there are other documents in those records which suggest that, which suggest the Department of Defense going in and saying, we met with a lot ofpeople and it was great, and we very much appreciate the access that we were getting.The Office of Career Services really exists as a kind of—it makes sure that students know that employers are coming and it makes sure that students have the opportunity to talk with those employers. The Veterans Association did a fabulous job of doing the same thing. So I do think that the military recruiters had excellent access either way, and in fact that semester in my deanship, the one period of 12 in which the Veterans Association did sponsor the interviews in that year, military recruiting did go up. I do think that the effects in some sense speak for themselves.

Senator, with respect, I don’t think that that’s what happened here.

I’m sorry. The memo which is? 

Yes. Well, I’ve seen the document and the document is—— 

Is—— 

The document is certainly in my handwriting. I don’t know whether the document was a product of a conversation that I had had with them. 

If I could just go back, Senator Hatch. 

This was an incredibly difficult issue for everybody who was associated with it, for obvious reasons. President Clinton had strong views on this issue, and what he thought was that this procedure should be banned in all cases except where the procedure was necessary to save the life or to prevent serious health consequences to the woman. Those were always his principles. We tried, over the course of the period of time when this statute was being considered, actually twice, to get him absolutely the best medical evidence on this subject possible. And it was not easy because, as everybody in Congress knows, different people said different things about this. There was conflicting evidence. And we tried to do our best to bring all the evidence, all the conflicting views to his attention. In the course of that, we did indeed speak with ACOG. ACOG had an interest in this statute and ACOG had views about the statute. What ACOG thought and always conveyed to us was two things. What ACOG thought was that, on the one hand, they couldn’t think of a circumstance in which this procedure was the absolutely only procedure that could be used in a given case. But second, on the other hand, that they could think of circumstances in which it was the medically best or medically most appropriate procedure, that it was the procedure with the least risk attached to it in terms of preventing harm to the women’s health. And so we knew that ACOG thought both of these things. We informed the President, President Clinton, of that fact. There did come a time when we saw a draft statement that stated the first of these things which we knew ACOG to believe, but not the second, which we also knew ACOG to believe. And I had some discussions with ACOG about that draft. 

The—— 

No, no, no. You’re exactly right. I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you were referring—— 

Yes. Yes. No, that’s exactly right. And—and the disaster would be, if the statement did not accurately reflect all of what ACOG thought, both—I mean, that there were two parts of what ACOG thought. And I recall generally, not with any great specificity but recall generally, talking to ACOG about that statement and about whether that statement was consistent with the views that we knew it had because they had stated them, that there was both, not the only procedure, but also that it was in some circumstances the medically best procedure.And in their final statement, that—that sentence that it was not the only procedure, of course, remained because that is what they thought. But we did have some discussions about clarifying the second aspect of what they also thought, which was that it was in some circumstances the medically most appropriate procedure. And so I think that this was all done in order to present both to President—both to the President and to Congress the most accurate understanding of what this important organization of doctors believed with respect to this issue.

Senator Hatch, there was no way in which I would have, or could have, intervened with ACOG, which is a respected body of physicians, to get it to change its medical views on the question. The only question that we were talking about was whether this statement that they were going to issue accurately reflected the views that they had expressed to the President, to the President’s staff, to Congress, and to the American public. I do agree with you, this was an enormously hard issue. President Clinton found it so, and thought that the procedure should not be used except in cases where it was necessary for life or health purposes. And we tried to get him the best information we could about the medical need for this procedure, something that was not always easy, and tried to, in all the statements that he made, to make sure and—and any statements—other statements that we were aware of to make sure that that information was accurately conveyed to the American public. 

OK, Senator Feinstein, I’ll try. I guess I’ll start with the question of the two clauses, because both are very important to our constitutional system and neither should be subordinated to the other. There are times when they are in some tension with each other. Now, I think it’s important to recognize that there are many times when that’s not so, where they in fact go hand in hand and function perfectly well together. But there are some times when they may be in tension and it can cut in either direction. So suppose that a State—a State government decides to give what is called a voluntary accommodation to some religious person, essentially a voluntary exemption of that person from an otherwise generally applicable law, and does that because the law would impose some substantial burdens on that person’s religious practice, and the State thinks, you know what? In those circumstances we think that the person should be exempted from the law so that the person can follow the dictates of her conscience. But then somebody else comes in and says, well, what do you mean? You’re giving that exemption but you’re not giving me an exemption, and—and—and why are you making that sort of special accommodation to this—to this person? That special accommodation must count as an establishment of religion, and so there you get a claim where there is an accommodation to religious—the free exercise of religion, but then there’s a claim that that violates the Establishment Clause part of the First Amendment. And that’s the kind of way in which there might be tension. But what the court has said with respect to this issue, and there seems to me great virtue in this approach, is that in order to prevent that from happening or to prevent it the other way, where the State does something in order to—to advance Establishment Clause values and then somebody comes in and makes a free exercise claim, either way, what the court has—has stated is that thereneeds to be some play in the joints, there needs to be some freedom for government to act in this area without being subject to a claim from the other side, some freedom for government to make religious accommodations without being subject to Establishment Clause challenges and some freedom on government’s part to enforce the values of the Establishment Clause without being subject to free exercise claims.That’s not to say how any particular case should come out because sometimes the State goes too far, but that in general there needs to be a little bit of play in the joints in order to prevent the State from sort of not being able to do anything, from being hamstrung in this area.As to—as to what Establishment Clause tests I would use, that is a hard, hard question. Right now, there are a multitude of such tests. The—the—the most established one, the oldest one, is the Lemon v. Kurtzman test, which is a three-part test focusing on the purpose of a governmental action, the effect of a governmental action, whether the governmental action has the effect—has the primary effect of inhibiting or advancing religion, and the third part of the test focuses on entanglement between the government and the religious entity.And many, many justices have tried to kill this test. I think that there have been six individual justices who at least have expressed some skepticism about it. But it—it continues on. It has not been reversed. It—it’s—and—and it’s—it’s usually the test that the lower courts apply. It’s sometimes applied and sometimes not applied by the Supreme Court, very much depending on the circumstances, but it continues to be the—the—the test—the primary test of the court. Now, other justices have had different ways of approaching this issue.Justice O’Connor famously asked about whether particular actions would be seen by reasonable observers as endorsements of religion. Some of the justices have used a kind of coercion test, asking whether a governmental action coerces a person in the exercise of religion. Justice Breyer has recently talked about religious divisiveness as a way to approach Establishment Clause inquiries.And I think that the reason why there are so many tests, and I don’t think that I’ve mentioned all of them even, I think that the reason is that the Establishment Clause can arise in a very wide variety of contexts with a very wide variety of factual situations and circumstances.Sometimes one test might seem the appropriate way to analyze the problem and sometimes another, and it’s very hard to say, kind of in the abstract, which is appropriate, that it’s a more—it’s a matter of sort of situation sense, if you will. It’s a more contextual inquiry as to what’s the approach to use that would make sense.In general, I think what the—both First Amendment clauses are designed to do, and this is the way in which they work hand-inhand with each other, what they’re both designed to do is to ensure that you have full rights as an American citizen. You are a part of this country no matter what your religion is. And—and to—to ensure that religion just never functions as a way to put people, because of their religious belief or because of their religious practice, at some disadvantage with respect to any of the rights ofAmerican citizenship. So I think that that’s the sort of overall purpose of both parts of the amendment.As to the matter of taxpayer standing, I want to be very careful here because there is a taxpayer standing issue, as I understand it, that will be before the court next term. The—the court has stated that taxpayers generally have standing to make certain kinds of Establishment Clause claims, specifically claims against Congressional legislation when—when—that a taxpayer, by virtue of being a taxpayer, can sue to contest governmental actions taken under Congress’ power to appropriate money, but that a taxpayer may not have standing to contest executive action just by virtue of being a taxpayer.Now, that doesn’t mean that some—that there may not be somebody who has standing to contest such action. I think what the court has suggested is just that the sort of normal injury that Article 3 requires has to be shown, the injury can’t come just by virtue of being a taxpayer but has to come from something else in addition. But there is, I think, a case on the docket.

Yes. Exactly right. 

Senator Grassley, it was obviously a very controversial decision that has inspired a great deal of—of action in the State legislatures. I’ve not commented on particular cases. I’ve not graded cases. But a few thoughts about Kelo. Of course, what— what the—what the court in Kelo did was to say that the question of public use was not necessarily use by the public, but instead was use for a public purpose. The court said that in the context of a taking of property that was done pursuant to a broad-scale urban development plan, so I think it—it remains an open question whether that public purpose test would apply in any other context without such a broad-scale urban development plan. You know, one of the things that you learn in your first year of law school in your property class is Cutler v. Bull. The principle of Cutler v. Bull is that the government can’t take the property of A just to give it to B. Here, what the—what the court said was that that principle did not apply, but it was very much dependent on this overall urban redevelopment plan. The question of—of—of whether the public purpose doctrine would apply outside of that context is, I think, an open question. It’s also true—it’s also true that in some sense what the—what the—what the court did in this area when it said this was to kick the question back into the political process. In other words, the court didn’t say, of course, that the government had to make—to do such takings. What the government said was that a State was permitted to do so.And what States have done in the wake of that decision, in a— in a very striking manner, I think, is to say thanks, but no thanks, you know. We don’t want that power, we don’t want to be—we don’t want to do this. We think doing this, taking property from one person to give it to another person, even in the context of a broad redevelopment plan, is not appropriate public policy.So a number of States, I know—I don’t know the exact number, but quite a number—have passed these kinds of anti-Kelo legislation, which makes sure that the—that the question never arises because the State government doesn’t try to effect such a taking in the first instance.

Well, I—I—I do think that that Kelo only talked about that doctrine in the context of this urban development plan, so I think that the limits are the limits suggested by the Kelo facts themselves. I don’t think that the court went beyond those facts in its decision.

Gosh, you know, I don’t remember that exact line from Kelo, so I’m a little bit guessing as to the context. But I—I think probably what the court meant was a taking that the government does not truly to serve a public purpose, but instead more to give the property to another individual person, the kind of Cutler v. Bull scenario, take property from A, give it to B under the guise of a public purpose. So I would think that that’s what the court meant, although I don’t recall that exact statement. And I think that that also would provide a limit of—of the kind you’re speaking about on—on the doctrine.

Well, you know, I’ve—I’ve—I’ve tried very hard, Senator Grassley, not to suggest where I see deficiencies in—in the court’s handling of cases, so I think I won’t answer that question with that degree of specificity. I mean, it is quite clear that the Constitution does in various ways, and most notably by the Takings Clause, protect property rights and that the job of the courts, with respect to those rights as any other, is to ensure that government does not overstep its proper bounds.

Well, I—I do think that property rights are a foundation stone of liberty, that the two are intimately connected to each other in our society and in our history.

That was not my position, Senator Grassley. And if we could just step back a moment.

Right. So let me just step back for a moment. This was, of course—President Clinton was very committed to the Brady law, which was a way of ensuring that guns were kept out of the hands of criminals, were kept out of the hands of insane people, by doing background checks on people before they could receive access to guns. It was a law, of course, with very wide support in Congress and across the country. It remains in effect today.The court, in Prince—there was a system, a Federal system that enabled gun dealers to do those background checks, but it had not yet come into effect. I think it came into effect in 1998, and there we were in 1994 or 1995 or 1996, or something like that. And in the interim, before the Federal system was ready to operate in order to implement the Brady law, what had—what had happened was that the Brady law had required States to themselves do the background checks.The CLEOs, the Chief Law Enforcement Officers of each jurisdiction, were required to do the background checks. And the court, in Prince, held that system unconstitutional, said that that was a violation of the Tenth Amendment because it inappropriately commandeered State officials for Federal purposes. And what that meant was that there was a kind of gap. The Congress could not require the State officials to do the background checks, but the Federal system—it’s called the—I think it’s the Insta-Check System, or something like that. The Federal system had not come into effect.So the question was what to do in that period of, I don’t know, it was like 18 months or 2 years to ensure that background checks could be done consistent with the Brady law. What I suggested toMr. Burke in that memo was to say, let’s see if there are any ways in which the President can take executive action to put in place some kind of interim system. That executive—to do background checks. Again, that executive action, of course, had to be consistent with the law, of course had to be consistent with any statutes that Congress had passed, Brady or anything else, and had to be consistent with the Constitution as well.As I recall, and it’s many moons ago, obviously, we didn’t find any way to do that. I’m trying to think of exactly what did happen in that interim period. I think for the most part, States voluntarily did what they had been doing until the Federal system came into play and sort of mooted out the whole inquiry.

Yes. The President could only do it if Congress—if legislation authorized him to do it. If legislation did, you know, that’s fine. If there was no legislative authorization, then he couldn’t do it.

As I said, I never believed that the President had the power to prohibit that without legislative authorization, so in fact that’s one that Heller and McDonald don’t affect, that the President didn’t have that power before and doesn’t have that power after.

Senator Grassley, I’ve never had occasion to look into the history of this matter. What I do know is that Heller has stated very specifically that self-defense is the core of the Second Amendment right, which Heller has held confers an individual right to bear arms. The majority opinion in Heller really does speak of self-defense as the central element of that right.

Right. And that is, you know, a central part of the rationale of Heller and is settled law in the ways that I’ve expressed going forward.

Senator Grassley, there is, of course, a case coming down the road and I want to be extremely careful about this question and not to in any way prejudge any case that might come before me.

I think I’ll leave it there, given the—— 

So I think that that—my best understanding is that that decision has some precedential weight, but not the weight of a ‘‘normal’’ decision. What that decision was, it was done under the court’s then-mandatory appellate jurisdiction and it dismissed the case, for want of a substantial Federal question. It dismissed it summarily without hearing arguments or reading briefs or whatever, just saying it was not going to accept the case under its thenjurisdictional powers. My understanding is that there’s actually a question about what kind of precedential weight such a decision is entitled to, and arguments on both sides of that. I think, you know, probably the better view or the view that most people hold, I think, is that it’s entitled to some precedential weight but not the weight that would be given to a fully argued, fully briefed decision. 

My understanding is that there is sort of a question about the precedential effect of those kinds of summary dispositions. My—what I—what I think is true, is that most people think that those kinds of summary dispositions have some precedential weight, but not the precedential weight that’s given to a fully argued and fully briefed decision. 

Senator Grassley, I think that the—that the task for a court is—is, you know, to decide a case that comes before it. A case might come before it or might not come before it. If it does come before it, the question will be to—you know, to consider the facts, to consider the arguments that are made, to hear the—to read the briefs.

Well, as I suggested, Senator Grassley, first, I think that there was a question about the precedential weight to be given to summary dispositions, and I would very much want to hear argument and hear briefing about that question and talk to my colleagues about that question. My—my best understanding is that what most people think is that these summary dispositions get some precedential weight, but they—and—but they don’t get the full weight that a fully briefed, fully argued decision gets.There is—you can see why people might think that, because part of the reason that a decision counts as precedent is because it really has been fully considered, that the briefs have been read, that the arguments have been heard, that the judges have had a chance to talk with each other, and the question is whether a summary disposition, because it’s done kind of, you know, without all that process, gets the full precedential weight.As I’ve said, this is—this is—this is not a question on which I’ve thought deeply. I’m sort of expressing to you my best understanding of what I take to be kind of the consensus position on this, but it’s—obviously the question on the precedential weight of that summary disposition is itself a question for the court to consider and—and I would do so in the usual way.

Senator Specter, this is difficult for me because, as I understand this, this is a live case and I continue to represent one of the parties in this case. In other words, there may very well be a petition for certiorari in this case, but I continue to be Solicitor General and—and would head the office that would have to respond to that petition. And I think that——

That is—that is true, Senator Specter. But—but I don’t want to count my chickens before I am confirmed. I still am Solicitor General and I’m the counsel of——

I think I remain Solicitor General unless and until this body confirms me, and that means I remain a party in this very case that you’re—that you’re asking me about. 

I—I think I’m going to be responsible for responding to the petition for certiorari in this case as Solicitor General, unless I’m confirmed to the court, and while I’m Solicitor General I don’tthink that I can say how I would vote on a—on a cert response that the Solicitor General will be filing.

Senator Specter, the government did argue, based on very extensive consultations, that the Supreme Court ought not to take that case, and that continues to be the government’s position. You know, I don’t think it would be right for me to undermine the position that we took in that way by suggesting that it was wrong.It was, in fact, a position of the U.S. Government, in line with the interests of the U.S. Government, that I authorized and that I thought was appropriate for a number of reasons, which—which I’m happy to talk about with you. But—but I—I can’t say—I mean, I’ve not said with respect to any of—I think that the decisions that I made as Solicitor General on behalf of the U.S. Government as my client are ones that I can’t undermine in this—in this hearing room.

Well, Senator Specter, I do think that this is a case that, as I understand it, generally falls within the third category of case, a case which presents an extremely important Federal issue as to whether the executive has overstepped its appropriate authority and has essentially flouted legislation in the area. The sort of curlicue on this case does have to do with the standing question, with the question whether the court has jurisdiction and could reach the merits question, which is of such importance. Now——

Senator Specter, I’ve—I’ve not read the petitions, I’ve not read the briefs in the way that I would as a judge. I do think that the standing issue itself is of some real importance, and it’s of some real importance because it goes to the question, who does have standing to—to challenge surveillance policies when the very notion of those surveillance policies—when—when those surveillance policies are confidential and you don’t know whether you’re being surveilled.And if nobody does have the ability to come in and say, look, I have reasonable grounds to believe that I’m being surveilled, if instead one has to show that one absolutely has been surveilled, that really does—you know, that very much detracts from the ability to ever reach the merits question of whether the surveillance is appropriate. So I think for that reason, you know, the standing issue is of significant importance as well.

Senator Specter, as I understand it, the congruence and proportionality test is currently the law of the court, and not withstanding that it’s been subjected to significant criticism and not withstanding that it’s produced some extremely erratic results. And I can’t, you know, sit at this table without briefing, without argument, without discussion with my colleagues and say, well, I just don’t approve of that test, I would reverse it.What I can say is that I understand the criticisms that have been leveled against that test. There seems to me real force in the notion that a test in this area dealing with Congress’ Section 5 powers really needs to provide clear guideposts to Congress so that Congress knows what it can do and knows what it can’t do, and so the goalposts don’t keep changing and so Congress can do what—can pass legislation, confident in the knowledge that that legislation will be valid. And I think that that those concerns are a very significant weight, and—and the question for the future on the court will be whether those concerns can be met under the test that’s now in existence.

Well, Senator Specter, I certainly do have to rebrief and——

Senator Specter, I—I do have to read briefs and listen to arguments and discuss——

This is—— 

Senator Specter, the congruence and proportionality test has been a standard that’s been adopted by the court that is precedent going forward, and you shouldn’t want a judge who will sit at this table and who will tell you that she will reverse a decision without listening to arguments and without reading briefs and without talking to colleagues, notwithstanding that that person knows that that test has been subject to serious criticism. 

Senator Kyl, I don’t think we did, or at the very least we did not mean to compare you to dictators. The only thing that the letter was meant to say was that we should hold ourselves to very high standards, at least as high, or higher, than the standards that we would apply to dictatorships. And those were the standards that we were urging Congress to hold itself to in considering this legislation. And Congress in fact did. I mean, within a matter of day Congress came together, 84 to 15, a remarkable act of bipartisanship and passed a very good piece of legislation which did provide our Article 3 review of—— 

Senator, I think that the focus of the letter as the focus of everybody’s attention at that time was on the Guantanamo detainees. And as you know I, as Solicitor General, I’ve advocated strongly and I’ve made sure that my name appeared as counsel of record on the U.S. Government’s Bagram brief because I believed that the United States has very strong interests in this in the——

Well, the letter, I do think, was focusing on Guantanamo detainees and was focusing on two questions——

I think we can argue about the letter, the legislation and what every——

The—— 

Senator Kyl, I’m Solicitor General. The view that I have advocated, and I have advocated it strongly, including by signing my name on a Court of Appeals brief, which the Solicitor General almost never does, is that habeas should not extend to Bagram. Now, I couldn’t comment, I would be recused from that case that I signed my name on. This decision might come to the Court—excuse me, this question—— 

Well, Senator Kyl, I don’t think that that letter expresses view on the question of habeas rights at Bagram. I think that that letter was focused on the Guantanamo issue. 

I think that that’s just a description of what we were aware of. But the focus of the letter——

Senator Kyl, I don’t believe that that is a question that has come before the Courts. And given that——

Senator Kyl, what we expressed in that letter was opposition to the totality of the initial Graham Amendment, not the Graham/Kyl/Levin Amendment that eventually passed. There were a number of things about that amendment that we thought went too far. I think we were stating the full extent of the amendment’s effect. But I don’t think that that letter can fairly be read to express a legal view as to each of the particular—— 

Senator Kyl—— 

Senator Kyl, my view of that letter or my view of just my current state of mind is that I have no preexisting views on the way I would approach, as a judge, the sort of questions that you are asking me about. Now, you know, I am perfectly happy to go back to that letter and to try to parse it as carefully as you are parsing it, and to see whether it expressed a point of view—expressed a view as to a particular legal issue that might come before me. And if I think thatthe letter does express a very particular point of view on a particular issue that might come before me, as in all such cases, I will certainly consider that fact, talk to my colleagues about that fact in determining whether recusal is appropriate.

Senator Kyl, that question was asked me in my role as Solicitor General. The question came to me from Senator Cornyn because Senator Cornyn acknowledged and stated what is true which is that I had opposed and stated opposition to the ‘‘don’t ask, don’t tell’’ policy and Senator Cornyn asked me, given that stated opposition, could you perform the role of Solicitor General and particularly, I think, could you with appropriate vigor defend the constitutionality Doma?And my answer was meant to say, yes, I absolutely could defend vigorously the constitutionality of Doma, that I understood what the state of the law was and that I understood what my professional responsibilities were. And if that case had come to the Supreme Court this year, I certainly would have been at the podium——

I was absolutely saying that I understood the state of the law and that I accepted the state of the law——

I am saying that I very much understood, accepted the state of the law and that I was going to perform all my obligations as Solicitor General consistent with that understanding and consistent with that acceptance.

I don’t think that that would be appropriate. As Senator Grassley and I talked about, there is a case that’s pending, the case may or some other case might come before the Court, and so I couldn’t go any further than that.

The question was, could I perform my responsibilities as Solicitor General? Did I understand the law, did I accept the state of the law? And the answer was yes as to both.

Senator Kyl, I’m persuaded that we made the correct decision on the law in both of those cases. I don’t think that I can talk about internal deliberations of the Solicitor General’s office whether with respect to the White House or otherwise.

Senator Kyl, I don’t think it would be right for me to talk about, you know, particular contacts and particular cases. That that counts as sort of internal deliberations. I do think that we made the right decision on the law for the United States’ interests in both of those cases.

Senator Kyl, the Solicitor General’s office does, from time to time, and I think that this is true in every administration, have some communications with members of the White House with respect to particular cases. That is not a surprising thing and I think it’s true in every administration. But I don’t think it wouldbe right to talk about internal deliberations in any particular case and I do think that as to both of those cases that you mentioned the Solicitor General’s office made the correct decision on the law, on the legal principles that were involved for the United States as a client.

Senator Kyl, I do believe that this is an American Constitution. That one interprets it by looking at the structure, our own history, and our own precedents. And that foreign law does not have precedential weight.Now, in the same way that a judge can read a Law Review article and say, well, that’s an interesting perspective or I learned something from it, I think that so too a judge may read a foreign judicial decision and say, well, that’s an interesting perspective, I learned something from it. Suppose, you know, we have a Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule—suppose that——

I’m just trying to suggest that it’s of the same kind of relevance that it would be if you read a Law Review article about a similar subject.

I said yesterday when I talked about the subject, I said that—I used as an example a brief that the Solicitor General’s office had filed on the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. When we filed that brief we talked about what some other countries had done on the Foreign Sovereign——

Because—— 

I think we have a Constitution and it’s the same Constitution that we’ve always had putting aside the Article 5 Amendment process. And that it is meant to endure for the ages. The Constitution does not change, but it is—it is asked to apply and Courts must apply it to changing circumstances and to changing conditions. And in the course of that application there is development in constitutional law. The Constitution itself is fixed and the Constitution itself is binding. 

Well, the Court has interpreted the commerce clause broadly, not in an unlimited way, but broadly. I agree with you, Senator Kyl, that the Court has an important role to play in this as in any area in order to ensure the government does not overstep its proper authority. We live in a government of limited and enumerated powers. The government cannot exercise authority beyond—excuse me, the Federal Government, Congress, cannot exercise its powers beyond the authority that the Constitution provides. The commerce clause has been understood to give Congress wide authority in this area. The general view has been that regulations affecting interstate commerce primarily are the prerogative of Congress and not of the Courts. The Courts ought to defer. Defer does not mean abdicate and there remains an important role to play. The limits that have been set and that exist currently are the limits that appear in the Morrison and the Lopez case which separates out non-economic activity from economic activity and talks as well about areas which are traditionally the prerogative of the states. Those are the limitations that the Court’s current doctrine imposes. I treat those limits as precedent going forward and for sure would not think that it’s appropriate to abdicate in this are but do think that deference is generally correct with respect to economic legislation. 

No, that sounds right. 

Yes, sir. 

It said that separate but equal facilities were consistent with the equal protection clause. 

I feel as though I should be, but I’m going to say no. 

It did not. 

Well, Senator Graham, I guess a couple of things. The words of the Constitution did not change. But two things did change. The precedents changed and understandings and circumstances in the world changed. So the precedents clearly did change. Brown was not a thunderbolt from the blue. 

It was the last in a long line of decisions. And one of Justice Thurgood Marshall’s—his greatest accomplishment was to lead up to Brown, step by step, by step, case by case, by case. As an advocated, of course, you can have a strategy like that, and he did. And by the time the Court got to Brown, upholding Plessy actually would have been inconsistent with a series of other holdings that it had reached over the years. And I do think that that sometimes happens in constitutional interpretation. It also happens—I mean, we’ve talked a lot about the doctrine of precedent and about one reason to reverse a decision is when its doctrinal support has been completely eroded. And I think that that is what happened in Brown. By the time the Court reached Brown ?

As I understand the law after Casey, it’s that after viability the state can regulate as it pleases except for situations where the woman’s life or health interests are at issue. Before viability the question is whether there is an undue burden——

Senator Graham, I do think that in every area that it is fair to consider scientific changes. I’ve talked in the past about how different forms of technology influence the evolution of the Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. 

I would have taken you. [Laughter.] 

I did, Senator Graham. 

Senator Graham, I honestly don’t know the answer to that. I don’t know what other schools, you know, have employers come and how they do it and I don’t know whether any other schools have particular policies respecting this. 

Senator Graham, the recruiters could have met on campus as well. 

And could have met on the law school campus. The only restriction that we put on was that the Office of Career Services couldn’t provide assistance. 

No, it’s just an office, really. I mean, most—95 percent of interviews from employers at Harvard Law School—— 

Senator Graham, I think what I was trying to do was on the one hand to ensure military recruiting, on the other hand to enforce and to defend the school’s very long standing antidiscrimination policy. So it wasn’t me making a political statement; it was me as Dean of the Law School, and that’s what I was, I had an institutional responsibility as Dean of the Law School trying to defend an anti-discrimination policy that had existed for, I don’t know, 25 years, and—— 

Well, the way we enforce this policy is if an employer comes, we give the employer a form. And the form basically says, you know, I comply with the following policy. And it says, ‘‘I will not discriminate on the basis of’’ and then it says somethinglike, race and creed, and gender, and sexual orientation, and actually veteran status as well. And if the employer signs the form the employer can get the services of the Office of Career Services. And if not, not.

It was not, Senator Graham. I was just trying to defend a very long standing and——

I was two things in the Clinton Administration. I was a lawyer for about half the time and I was a policy person for about half the time.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

No, sir. It was not. I mean, my—this was—— 

Senator, I was working for a President who had clear views on this subject. 

With respect, Senator, it’s not true. I had no agenda with respect to this issue. I was trying to——

I was trying to implement the agenda of the United States President whom I worked for. So I was——

I was, at all times, trying to ensure that President Clinton’s views and objectives with respect to this issue were carried forward. And President Clinton had strong views with respect to this issue.

Senator Graham, the two of us have agreed on many things over the course of this hearing and——

But what I tried to do was to implement the objectives of the president on this issue. At the same time to provide the president with the best legal advice, straight objective as I could. 

And when I became a policy person to enforce and to ensure that his policy views were carried out. 

I’m sorry?

Well, Senator Graham, I think my definition is somebody who doesn’t take three principles to heart. The first principle is deference to the political branches in making the policy decisions of this Nation, because that’s who ought to be making the policy decisions of this Nation.The second principle is respect for precedent. Precedent as a doctrine of constraint and humility. And also stability in the law.And the third principle is deciding cases narrowly. Deciding them one at a time, deciding them on narrow grounds if one can, avoiding constitutional questions if one can.

Senator Graham, I’m not going to characterize any Justice as an activist judge, as a restrained judge. I think the best I can do is to set forth the principles that I think are appropriate and to say that if I’m so lucky—if I’m lucky enough to serve, Justice Kagan would abide by those principles.

You know, I have a feeling that if I do that I’m going to end up doing many things that I regret.[Laughter.] 

I think it means that the Court can change a statute and I think that that’s wrong.

And now we’re back to agreeing, Senator Graham. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Absolutely, Senator Cardin, that Gonzalez is settled law entitled to all the precedent of settled law going forward. 

Senator Cardin, I’m going to say the same thing to you that I hope I said to Senator Graham, which is, this is not a set of policy decisions that the Solicitor General’s Office or that I personally had anything to do with. And I feel uncomfortable discussing that. I think that these are questions that are better addressed to the people who are making policy within the Justice Department on this issue.

Well, what Senator Kennedy focused on, I think I said to Senator Feinstein that some members of the Court have used on certain occasions a coercion test. The question as to whether a particular governmental action coerces a person in his or her religious beliefs. And the Levy/Wassmann case is one that does use that coercion test in a way that provokes strong disagreement as well. The question about whether that graduation prayer did coerce students in a constitutionally meaningful manner. Senator Kennedy, a majority of the Court held that it did.As the Court’s precedent has come down, it seems a highly factspecific inquiry. Certainly the coercion test is used most often when it comes to children. And the Court—you know, the Court’s cases essentially see a difference between coercion of adults thinking that adults can kind of stand up for themselves and coercion of children where there’s a greater fear of the government’s impact—coercive impact. And I think that Levy/Wassmann reflects that.But it is a contentious area in the law. With some people I think that that case is a good example of the way in which people can look at the same kind of action and some see coercion and some not.

Well, Senator Cornyn, I do think that sometimes people can take a look at opinions and they’re very strongly worded and think, my gosh, these people must just hate each other. And then it turns out that not at all, there are good faith differences on the law, but the same people who are sort of taking swipes at each other in opinions see each other as people who are operating in complete good faith and get along with each other in the next case or the case before, and certainly in their lives.

Senator Cornyn, I didn’t see the op-ed, I’ve been trying very hard not to read the papers.

Senator Cornyn, I take everything that has been said here from all the way around the bench as people operating in good faith. And certainly I’ve gotten nothing but fairness and courteousness from everybody, from every member of the committee. I take no offense on behalf of myself or on behalf of Justice Marshall or on behalf of anybody else at anything that’s been said here. 

You know, I think I would—I am trying to think— I mean, I think that what I’ve said is that you look to text, youlook to structure, you look to history, very much including and very especially the original understandings, and you look to precedents. And in one or another of cases, one of those may be more important than others of them. In some cases you might look to all of them. And that’s a kind of pragmatic approach, not an approach that takes a sort of grand, overarching philosophical view as to, you know, it’s just one thing and it’s got to be that one thing in every case. And that’s the way I would approach the——

Well, I think that traditions are most often looked to in considering the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I think every member of the Court think that the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to more than physical restraints and I think almost every member thinks that it gives them substantive protection and not just procedural protections.And then the question becomes, what substantive protections does it provide? And I think that the best statement of the approach that the Court has used is actually Chief Justice Rehnquist’s statement in the Glucksberg case. Because he says he basically agrees with both of those things that the Due Process Clause provides substantive protection and means more than restraint from physical restraint. But then the question is, how do you define that and do you appropriately limit that? Because it’s for sure the case that the Courts should not use that clause to appropriate decisions that best belong to the American people.

Well——

You said a lot there. And I think that the view that I would have is consistent not with any particular article by Mr. Liu or otherwise. But it is consistent with the way that the Court has approached these questions and I particularly think of the Glucksberg case which does talk about that way the Court looks to traditions, looks to the way traditions can change over time, but makes sure—makes very clear that the Court should operate with real caution in this area, that the Court should understand that the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide clear signposts, should make sure that the Court is not interfering inappropriately with the decisions that really ought to belong to the American people. And so should understand that the clause protects things, but should act in this area with appropriate caution and respect for democracy.

I think that the military had good access during the periods where the Office of Career Services handled it and had good access when the veterans association handled the matter.

Yes. When the Office of Career Services did not provide the assistance, but instead the Veterans Association provided the assistance. And I think that the figures suggest that. That both before 2002 and in the single recruiting period in 2005 when the Veterans Association handled this, there were just no differences in the numbers. To the extent that there were any differences, they went up in 2005.

That’s correct. Way back before I became dean my predecessor put in place this accommodation, this way of trying to defend the law school’s anti-discrimination policy but also enabling the military to recruit and that used the Veterans Association and they—the Veterans Association in all those years was just great in doing the things that the Office of Career Services otherwise would do.

Well, it was a faculty-approved anti-discrimination policy but I do agree with you, Senator Cornyn, that I would have—you know, I would have gone to the—I do agree with you that I had substantial authority over that question.

I do. That the military could not sign the discrimination policy that Harvard had because of the statute that was passed by Congress. And that, of course, presented the issue that was involved is that the military could not sign the school’s antidiscrimination policy, the school and I as dean felt a real imperative to enforce that policy, to defend that policy, but still to ensure that the military had very good access to all our students so that they could serve in the military. Because, you know, that was of critical importance. 

It places a condition on Federal funding and I forget the exact language that the Solomon Amendment—but it’s about military recruiting on campus.

This policy, I think, had worked well in the period before I became dean up until 2002. The Department of Defense had found this policy fully acceptable and it was my understanding that the Department of Defense and—that that was true, that their view that the policy enabled them good access. It was right, the policy did enable them good access.

Well, that happened before I became dean. So that happened the year before. In 2002 the Department of Defense said that it had changed its mind that for many years it had found the Harvard policy acceptable and had thought that it provided full access. In 2002 the Department of Defense came to the school and said that it in fact wanted the assistance of the Office of Career Services.

Senator Cornyn, it certainly was not to stigmatize the military. Every time I talked about this policy and many times besides I talked about the honor I had for the military and how much the military meant to our country and how we all have the freedoms that we have because of the military.

I think the purpose of the policy was something different. It was certainly not to stigmatize the military. The purpose of the policy was to express support for our students who were being discriminated against, for our gay and lesbian students who wanted to serve in the military. And the policy was meant to support them or to support with respect to other employers any other students who were being discriminated against and to say, you know, we support those students. And at the same time—at the same time to ensure that our students who wanted to go into the military had excellent access to military recruiters and vice versa.

I’m sorry? 

No, that’s good. That’s fine. 

That’s great. That’s great. 

Well, Senator Cornyn, I’ve refrained from agreeing or disagreeing, but I do believe that Lopez and Morrison are settled law and entitled to the precedential weight that one gives to any decision. 

You know, Senator Kyl asked me that question. I don’t think that I’ve done any academic work on the subject. I don’t know whether I’ve spoken about them in any of my many speeches or anything like that. 

You know, Senator Cornyn, I don’t at all remember the article and I’ve not seen it. I have seen more recently that memo which I just sort of think of as the Seminole Tribe memo. It’s a memo about the Seminole Tribe case.

And I think that I was—you know, what I did was I described that case. I guess I said in light of Lopez it does suggest that the Court is reorienting the Federal/state balance in this area which I think indeed happened in those year. I think that that was probably—if I caught that sentence that you wrote, I had referred to Lopez, but this was probably before Morrison. So I think that there were this set of changes that occurred in those years and that memo was about neither of those, it was about Seminole Tribe which dealt with Congress’ ability to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Commerce Clause. So that was a few years of—you know, important developments in the law relating to the Federal/state balance. 

And I’ve not seen that. 

Senator Cornyn, I have refrained from saying thumbs up, thumbs down on any cases. 

It actually sounds—I don’t even know what it means to be reactionary and dangerous. But the Morrison case, the Lopez case, the Seminole Tribe case are settled law. And I have, you know, no—I’ll say this, no plan, no purpose, no agenda, no anything to mess with them. [Laughter.] 

Mess with them. [Laughter.] 

I wouldn’t try to, Senator Cornyn. The test that the current court is using is this test of economic verus non-economic and that’s the test that I would expect to use under settled precedent. And if there are cases in which indeed the claim is presented that economic activity should not fall within Congress’ commerce power, those will be cases that I will decide in the appropriate way by reading the briefs and listening to the arguments and talking to my colleagues.

Thank you, Senator Cornyn. 

I can’t come back? [Laughter.] 

You know, I think I won’t watch. [Laughter.] 

Tell me everything I need to know. 

Yes. 

That would be the worst possible thing. 

Senator Whitehouse, as you asked the question, that seems unlikely. 

Yes. 

Senator Whitehouse, I guess I don’t want to make any comment about how one should—how one should discover a judge with an agenda.

Senator Whitehouse, I think I can only say what I just said.

Senator Whitehouse, I have to be honest with you and say that I’m more focused right now on what I would do as a justice if I’m fortunate enough to be confirmed, than any ways of discovering what any other judge might do that’s inappropriate. As I suggested to you before, I assume the good faith of everybody on the court and I think that’s the way I will approach the job and the institution.

Well, Senator Whitehouse, I think it’s not a matter of being in the right place. I think I’m saying what I think, which is that I respect the court as a whole enormously as an individual, and each of the members on it. That respect has grown every day in the year that I’ve been Solicitor General.

Thank you. 

I don’t know, Senator Coburn. 

I said that he is a great lawyer and a great human being, and I think I was asked whether he—— 

I wasn’t trying to avoid your question. I think he’d be a great judge. I think he——

Yes. 

I would have. 

I hope I would have, anyway. You know, who knows what it feels like to be one of you guys and to be subject to all the things that you guys are subject to. 

He should have been. 

Senator Coburn, it’s an interesting question because, of course, you want everybody—you want every—you want the Nation’s citizenry to have confidence in each institution of government. But on the other hand, I think it would be wrong for a court to decide an individual case by asking itself—— 

I think that the welfare of the country is certainly best served if the American people have confidence in the Supreme Court, as is true of the other branches of government as well. 

Senator Coburn, I—I think it would be better for the country if people had greater confidence than they do in all of the institutions of government, and that’s not to say—you know, it’s hard to know how these things work out over time. But—but, you know, it’s—the country is well served when people have confidence in the institutions that lead them. 

I believe that thoroughly. When I gave my opening statement I said that the blessing of liberty, which is the phrase that our Constitution uses, the ‘‘blessings of liberty’’ are rooted in the rule of law.

Maybe not after this hearing. 

How old was I 30 years ago? 

I’m not sure I have ever contemplated that exact question. 

Senator, I guess I’ll say this to what you said, which is that I believe that confidence in our institutions is terribly important. The confidence in the Supreme Court is terribly important. I do think that the job of a Supreme Court justice is to decide cases, and—and in deciding cases it’s not to think about big questions like restoring American confidence, that that’s more a question that belongs to the members of—of this body. I do think that the job of a Supreme Court justice is to listen very carefully to all arguments that are presented, and that means all arguments. That’s what I’ve pledged to do, and that’s what I will do if I’m——

Senator Coburn, I think that there are difficult cases that come to the court, no question.

Senator Coburn, I think when you say it’s Congress, I think that’s right, that some of the things you just talked about are policy issues that are appropriately addressed, debated, argued about by Congress, that of course decisions get to the court in a different way. They get to the court in the form of individual cases and controversies. And the only way that a judge can legitimately approach and decide issues is through that forum, by looking at, you know, the actual circumstances of a case, the actual facts, the record, and trying to apply the—the law as best one can.So it might be that some of these bigger issues that take place in Congress about the appropriate direction of the country, you know, in some way inform or—or—or seen in individual cases or controversies, but that’s the only way that the court can look at them, not as these big, abstract questions, but just——

Senator Coburn, I—I said in my opening statement that I was only going to make a single pledge, and that was the pledge that I made in my opening statement. But I’ll make you another: I’ll reread the Federalist Papers. 

It’s a great document. 

It’s a great document. 

Senator Coburn, I very much appreciate how deeply important the right to bear arms is to millions and millions of Americans, and I accept Heller, which made clear that the Second Amendment conferred that right upon individuals and not simply collectively. 

Senator Coburn, to be honest with you, I don’t have a view of what are natural rights, independent of the Constitution. And my job as a justice will be to enforce and defend the Constitution and other laws of the United States. 

Senator Coburn, I believe that the Constitution is an extraordinary document. And I’m not saying I do not believe that there are rights preexisting the Constitution and the laws, but my job as a justice is to enforce the Constitution and the laws.

Senator Coburn, I think that the question of what I believe as to what people’s rights are outside the Constitution and the laws, that you should not want me to act in any way on the basis of such a belief, if I had one or——

I think you should want me to act on the basis of law and that is what I have upheld to do, if I’m fortunate enough to be concerned—to be confirmed, is to act on the basis of law, which is the Constitutions and the statutes of the United States.

I’m sorry? 

I’ve not read McDonald yet because of these hearings, but if I understand Heller correctly, Heller—Heller did not find it necessary to reverse Miller. Heller distinguished Miller as involving a different kind of weapon. 

I think that is a fair characterization, Senator Klobuchar. I think that most White House assistants would—would sense the truth of that statement.

I guess, zero. 

It was very striking when Senator Feinstein said that she was one of two women. I thought, how amazing. So, how many? 

I’m stumped again. 

Well, there still are these disparities. And it’s interesting, because right now Harvard—and all schools—are about 50 percent women. Sometimes it’s 48 and sometimes it’s 52. Some schools are actually a good deal more, 55.

Yes. And I do think that if you look all over the legal profession, not just in—in these governmental institutions but in— certainly in law firms, women don’t have the kind of—there’s just not the kind of diversity that I think anybody would want. And— and I think people are trying hard to make that diversity happen. I don’t think it’s a matter of bad faith in this regard, but I do think that there are structural obstacles, that there are ways in which it’s hard to balance work and family. It’s still harder for a woman than it is for a man, and that that often comes into play in the legal profession, as it does elsewhere.And if you—if you look at these opportunities for women, you know, I think probably the best thing that we could do as a society—but this isn’t the court’s role, this really is Congress’ role—is to try to enable women and men, but I think that they especially strike women, to—to manage those balances, the—the desire to have a fulfilling professional life, and also the desire to have a wonderful family life, to manage that balance better and to sort of create the structures that enable them to do so.And, you know, the work that I did in the Clinton White House, you’re quite right, it had—it has nothing to do with what I would do as a judge, and it also didn’t have much to do with my particular beliefs, except that I did believe in—I mean, I was proud to serve in the administration of President Clinton. And one of the things that I did do there was to work on some of these issues, to work on issues relating to child care, for example, and to—to try to help women and men with these very difficult issues and how to have wonderful professional lives, and also have wonderful family lives.

I think that there’s no question that women have greater opportunities now, although they could be made greater still.

You know, I don’t want to make too much of this. 

The numbers were basically stable. There was certainly no drop in the—in the particular year in question. There was actually a slight uptick, but it seems to me that if you look over the whole history, both before I was dean and after I was dean, what it suggests is that the difference between military recruitment being done under the kind of auspices of the Office of Career Services and being done under the auspices of the veterans organization just didn’t make a difference. 

Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. 

Well, Senator Franken, I—I—first off, let me say that I think that that Comcast merger is under review by the Department of Justice at the current moment, so I want to steer well clear of that.

Yes. I mean, the—the—you know, the First Amendment does not provide a general defense, I think, to the antitrust laws. I’m not saying that in any particular cases First Amendment principles might not be relevant, but in general. The antitrust laws are the antitrust laws and they apply to all companies. 

Talk about? 

One of the purposes of the First Amendment is to ensure a public sphere in which all kinds of different opinions and views and thoughts can be expressed, and we can learn from all of them.

Of course. The First Amendment governs actions and behaviors by the federal government, as well as by the states.

Senator Franken, I—I guess you could be thinking about that as a kind of policy matter, as to whether the authorities that are responsible for approving mergers and such ought to take into account so-called, you know, First Amendment values, not the—and—and I think I would defer to people who know a lot more about antitrust policy than I do on that. So, I guess that’s what I’d say.

Yes, he did. 

Well, Brown v. Board of Education is the kind of iconic case that doesn’t belong on any list. 

Yes, sir, Mr. Franken. Yes. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes, sir. 

It is. 

Senator Franken, it seems as though you have it in front of you and you’re going to do a better job of it than I am at this moment. 

Well, there’s no doubt, Senator Franken, that racial classifications are subject to very high scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, and have been so for a long time. And the Equal Protection Clause exists to ensure against discrimination on disfavored bases, very much included, and the archetypal example is race, and that it is not only appropriate, but obligatory on the courts to enforce that prohibition on discrimination on the basis of race.

Well, Senator Franken, I will say that when I wrote those words I was not speaking of Footnote 4 and Carolene Products. I was speaking instead of—of what I’ve talked about several times at this hearing, which is Justice Marshall’s deep belief in ensuring a level playing field for all Americans and ensuring that each and every American, regardless of wealth or power or privilege, that each and every American gets fairly heard before the court. And—and when I—when I wrote that tribute to Justice Marshall and wrote those words, that was very much what I had in mind.

Senator Franken, I’ll just say what I’ve said on many occasions in the past, which is that Justice Marshall is a hero of American law and a hero of mine.

Isn’t email a wonderful thing? You can learn you’re wrong right away.[Laughter.] 

Senator Sessions, I agree with you that that is exactly what I should be doing if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, and I would do so without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. 

It feels a little bit odd to be taking what seems like that oath at this table. 

Senator Sessions, before you said it, I was just going to say that, in fact, every living Solicitor General did say that those documents ought not to be produced, and they said that because of an understanding about how the office works and how important confidentiality within the office is to effective decision-making. And I think that that’s absolutely right, and it is one of the reasons why I have not wanted to talk about any internal deliberations that have occurred within the office, and I certainly think that it was the right view then that those documents from within the office should not have been produced.

I do think that the Office of Solicitor General is a very special kind of office where candor and internal really truly thorough deliberation is the norm and that it would very much inhibit that kind of appropriate deliberation about legal questions if documents had the potential to be made public generally in that way.

Senator Sessions, our consistent view was that we were in compliance with the Solomon Amendment. Of course, the Department of Defense determined otherwise, and when the Department of Defense determined otherwise, we complied with what the Department of Defense asked of us.

Senator, at least as far back as when I was a student, there has actually not been a requirement that constitutional law is taken, but almost all students take a very great deal of constitutional law. 

When we reviewed our first-year curriculum, we determined really because the constitutional law professors of the school wanted to keep constitutional law in the second and third year where it could be taught more in-depth and more broadly where students would have really greater time to study it, the constitutional law professors thought that it would not be a good idea to put it in the first year. Some constitutional law actually we did put into the first year in a course on the governmental process, and particularly that deals with separation of powers law. In general—and this has been true for a long time—Harvard has taught constitutional law in the second and third year where thereare not requirements, but the vast majority of students take a very great deal of constitutional law.

Well, Senator Sessions, I have not read the McDonald case so I have not read what either Justice Scalia or Justice Stevens has to say about that question. It is interesting that you ask this with respect to the Second Amendment, because I think that I was asked about this question during my SG confirmation, was given a written question about whether I thought that the use of foreign law was appropriate in the context of the Second Amendment. And I hope I am remembering this correctly that I said it was not, that the Second Amendment question as defined by Heller was so peculiar to our own constitutional history and heritage that, you know, foreign law did not have any relevance. So I hope I am paraphrasing that accurately, but I know I wrote about it to the Senate previously. 

You were counting, huh? 

Senator Grassley, may I? 

This is not an area which I know a great deal about, so I thought that I was stating, you know, what Senator Leahy called hornbook law on this question. But it is not an area that I have studied in any depth, and I look forward to being further informed about it. 

Senator Grassley, I do think that that is an issue that might come before the Court, the constitutionality of DOMA, so it would not be appropriate for me to comment on it. 

Senator Grassley, this was not a case in which I was the decisionmaker. It was a case in district court, and the Solicitor General’s decision-making responsibilities take over at the appellate court level. It was a case in which members of my office and I reviewed some briefs and participated in some discussions. And I think I would need to say with respect to those discussions that, you know, I cannot reveal any kind of internal deliberations of theDepartment of Justice, but just to say that, in general, lawyers do make a raft of decisions, strategic and otherwise, about how best to present cases. And the Department of Justice is right now defending the DOMA legislation in the courts in that case and in a couple of others.

Senator Grassley, I am reticent to talk about particular decisions made with respect to that brief, not only because I was not the decisionmaker on that brief, but because the Department of Justice is currently litigating those cases, and I do not want to do anything that interferes or undermines or, you know, in any way gets in the way of the defense the Department of Justice is making on those cases.

Senator Grassley, I do believe that the Department of Justice is vigorously defending DOMA in that case and in other cases.

I think, Senator Grassley, that rights have to have textual bases, and so I would not subscribe to the Justice Douglas approach on penumbras and emanations.I do, as I think every nominee has, support the result in Griswold. I think that the way other Justices have understood that result as properly justified is through the Liberty Clause of the 14th Amendment.

I do believe that rights need a textual basis in the community, and they might have that basis in general clauses, but there needs to be a textual basis in the Constitution for any right.

Senator Grassley, I have tried during the course of this day and a half to state how I would approach constitutional interpretation, that where the text governs, the text governs; where more work needs to be done, what judges ought to look to is the structure of the Constitution, the history of the Constitution, and the precedent relating to the Constitution. And that is what I would do in any case. It is law all the way down, I think is what I said yesterday, and that is what I believe. It is not personal views. It is not moral views. It is not political views. It is law all the way down.

Senator Coburn, I want to say that I think it has been terrific. Everybody has been very fair and very considerate and I hope you found it informative. I found it somewhat wearying but actually a great moment in my life.

Well, Senator Coburn, I think this goes back to some of the discussion that we were having yesterday. As I understand the court’s commerce clause law, that test is the governing test which is entitled to the weight the precedent usually has.That means that it’s not enough to say that the decisions are wrong and it doesn’t matter why the decisions are wrong. It doesn’t matter whether the decisions are wrong because they are contrary to original intent or for some other reason why people might think that decisions are wrong.The point of precedent is to constrain judges and the point of precedent is to remind judges that they don’t know everything and that they should rely on sort of the wisdom of the courts and of other judges over time. I think that, and the point of precedent is to provide stability and reliability in the law.I think that those values govern even though somebody might come in and say a decision is wrong. That is true if the person says the decision is wrong because it violates the text or it violates the history, the original history or it violates anything else that there is, there needs to be a kind of high bar for reversing precedent.

It can be reversed, and we have talked on various occasions about when it can be reversed. In particular if the precedent is unworkable or if the precedent’s doctrinal support has eroded or if the precedent no longer fits the actual factual empirical circumstances that exist in the country, there are occasions in which precedent can be reversed.

Senator Coburn, I have tried hard not to characterize particular decisions, not to grade them, not to give them the thumbs up or the thumbs down.

Senator Coburn, when I talked about this with, I forget who I talked to about it.

I did talk about how one of the, I think an attribute of the coercion test is that four different people can look at a practice and have four different views as to whether coercion has in fact taken place.I think everybody would say that coercion, adults are different than children. I think the question of sort of who counts as a child and who counts as an adult is one of those matters that I think the coercion test is, notably presents that different people can look at the same set of facts and reach different conclusions as to whether the government in fact has engaged in coercive activity.

There was not. 

My only dealings with ACOG were about talking with them about how to ensure that their statement expresses their views. I was a staffer with no medical knowledge. I would not have presumed to nor would ACOG have thought it was relevant for me to. 

I definitely participated in discussion of this issue. 

Yes. I mean, I definitely participated as an aide in trying to implement the President’s views on this issue. 

I was—— 

I was concerned that that language did not accurately reflect what ACOG’s views were and what they had expressed to us. 

Thank you so much, Senator Coburn.
