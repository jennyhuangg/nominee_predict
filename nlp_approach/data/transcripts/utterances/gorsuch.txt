Pleasure to be here. Thank you. 

Just a little, Senator. 

Senator, this is quite a lot different than it was the last time I was here, and I appreciate all the attention. I would like to introduce my family who are here. My wife, Louise, who, as you remember, stole the show in the East Room the day I was nominated. 

I have got here somewhere, I am told, in the audience, my brother-in-law, my brother-in-law’s folks, Phil and Priscilla Albright, and my nephew Jack. How are you doing, Jack? [Laughter.](1)Judge GORSUCH. I have got my cousin Meg Hopkins and her daughter with her, Lori. I have got a bunch more family coming. My daughter is watching back home in the West.I have got my longtime assistant, Holly Cody. Where is Holly? There she is. Ten years we have worked together. I consider her family.And I have got a whole bunch of my law clerks here in the audience, and if they would not mind just standing up for a second, I would like to recognize them because I consider them family, too.So, Senator, I am very blessed to have so many family here with me today.Thank you. 

I had similar problems. 

I hope not. 

Close enough. 

Hello. 

Great. Thank you very much. 

Thank you, Senator. 

You do not have to ask me twice, Mr. Chairman. [Laughter.] 

Mr. Chairman, Senator Feinstein, Members of the Committee, I am honored and I am humbled to be here.Since coming to Washington, I have met with over 70 Senators. You have offered me a warm welcome and wise advice. Thank you.I also want to thank the President and the Vice President. They and their teams have been so gracious to me, and I thank them for this honor.I want to thank Senators Bennet and Gardner and General Katyal for their kind introductions, reminding us that long before we are Democrats or Republicans, we are Americans.Sitting here, I am acutely aware of my own imperfections. But I pledge to each of you and to the American people that, if I am confirmed, I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great Nation.Mr. Chairman, I could not even attempt to do this without Louise, my wife of more than 20 years. The sacrifices she has made, and her open and giving heart, leave me in awe.I love you so much. We started off in a place very different than this one, a tiny apartment and little to show for it. When Louise’s mother first came to visit, she was concerned by the conditions—understandably. As I headed out the door to work, I will never forget her whispering to her daughter, in a voice I think intended to be just loud enough for me to hear, ‘‘Are you sure he is really a lawyer?’’ [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. To my teenage daughters watching out West, bathing chickens for the county fair, devising ways to keep our determined pet goat out of the garden, building a semi-functional plyboard hovercraft for science fair, driving 8 hours through a Wyoming snowstorm with high school debaters in the back arguing the whole way, these are just a few of my very favorite memories. I love you girls impossibly. To my extended family here and across Colorado, when we gather, it is dozens of us. We hold different political and religious views, but we are united in our love. And between the family pranks and the pack of children running rampant, whoever is hosting is usually left with at least one drywall repair. To my parents and grandparents, they are no longer with us. But there is no question on whose shoulders I stand. My mom was one of the first women graduates of the University of Colorado Law School. As the first female Assistant District Attorney in Denver, she helped a program to pursue deadbeat dads. And her idea of daycare sometimes meant I have to spend the day wandering the halls or tagging along behind the police officers. She taught me that headlines are fleeting, courage lasts. My dad taught me that success in life has very little to do with success. Kindness, he showed me, is a great virtue. He showed me too that there are few places closer to God than walking in the wilderness or wading a trout stream, even if it is an awfully long drive home with the family dog after he encounters a skunk. To my grandparents, as a boy, I could ride my bike to their homes. They were a huge influence. My mom’s father, poor and Irish, worked to help support his family as a boy after losing his own dad. But the nuns made sure he got an education, and he became a doctor. Even after he passed away, I heard stories for years from grateful patients who recalled him kneeling by their bedsides so they might pray together. His wife, my grandmother, grew up on a Nebraska farm, where an icebox was not something you plugged into the wall but something you lowered into the ground. With 7 children, she never stopped moving, and she never stopped loving. My dad’s father made his way through college working on Denver’s trolley cars. He practiced law through the Great Depression. And he taught me that lawyers exist to help people with their problems, not the other way around. His wife came from a family of pioneers. She loved to fish, and she is the one who taught me how to tie a fly.I want to thank my friends, so many of whom are here, liberals and conservatives and independents from every kind of background and belief. Many hundreds have written this Committee on my behalf, and I am truly touched by their support.They have been there for me always, not least when we recently lost my Uncle Jack, a hero of mine and a lifelong Episcopal priest. He gave the benediction when I took an oath as a judge 11 years ago. I confess I was hoping he might offer a similar prayer soon. As it is, I know he is smiling.I want to thank my fellow judges across the country. Judging is sometimes a lonely and hard job. But I have seen how these men and women work, how hard they work, with courage and collegiality, independence, and integrity. It is their work that helps make real the Constitution and laws of the United States for all of us.I want to thank my legal heroes. Byron White, my mentor, a product of the West, he modeled for me judicial courage. He followed the law wherever it took him, without fear or favor to anyone. War hero, Rhodes Scholar, and, yes, the highest paid NFL football player of his day. In Colorado today, there is God, there is John Elway, and there is Peyton Manning. In my childhood, it was God and Byron White.I also had the great fortune to clerk for Justice Kennedy. He showed me that judges can disagree without being disagreeable, that everyone who comes to court deserves respect, that a case is not just a number or a name but a life’s story and a human being with equal dignity to my own.Justice Scalia was a mentor too. He reminded us that words matter, that the judge’s job is to follow the words that are in the law, not replace them with those that are not. His colleagues cherished his great humor too. Now, we did not agree on everything. The Justice fished with the enthusiasm of a New Yorker. He thought the harder you slapped the line on the water, somehow the more the fish would love it.Finally, there is Justice Jackson. He wrote so clearly that everyone could understand his decisions. He never hid behind legal jargon. And while he was a famously fierce advocate for his client when he was a lawyer, he reminded us that, when you become a judge, you fiercely defend only one client—the law.By their example, these judges taught me about the rule of law and the importance of an independent judiciary, how hard our forebears worked to win these things, how easy they are to lose, how each generation must either take its turn carrying the baton or watch it fall.Mr. Chairman, these days, we sometimes hear judges cynically described as politicians in robes, seeking to enforce their own politics rather than striving to apply the law impartially. But if I thought that were true, I would hang up the robe. The truth is, I just do not think that is what a life in the law is about.As a lawyer for many years working in the trial court trenches, I saw judges and juries, while human and imperfect, striving hard every day to fairly decide the cases I put to them.As a judge now for more than a decade, I have watched my colleagues spend long days worrying over cases. Sometimes the an-swers we reach are not the ones we personally prefer. Sometimes the answers follow us home at night and keep us up. But the answers we reach are always the ones we believe the law requires. And for all its imperfections, I believe that the rule of law in this Nation truly is a wonder, and that it is no wonder that it is the envy of the world.Of course, once in a while, we judges do disagree. But our disagreements are not about politics, but about the law’s demands.Let me offer an example. The first case I wrote as a judge to reach the Supreme Court divided 5–to–4. The Court affirmed my judgment with the support of Justices Thomas and Sotomayor, while Justices Stevens and Scalia were in dissent.Now that is a lineup some might think unusual. But actually, it is exactly the sort of thing that happens, quietly, day in and day out, in the U.S. Supreme Court and in the courts across this country.I wonder if people realize that Justices Thomas and Sotomayor agree about 60 percent of the time, or that Justices Scalia and Breyer agreed even more often than that, all in the very toughest cases in our entire legal system.And here is another example about my record. Over the last decade, I have participated in over 2,700 appeals. Often these cases are hard, too. Only about 5 percent of all Federal lawsuits make their way to decision in a Court of Appeals. I have served with judges appointed by President Obama all the way back to President Johnson. And in the Tenth Circuit, we hear cases from six different States covering two time zones and 20 percent of the continental United States.But in the West, we listen to one another respectfully. We tolerate. We cherish different points of view. And we seek consensus whenever we can. My law clerks tell me that 97 percent of those 2,700 cases I have decided were decided unanimously, and that I have been in the majority 99 percent of the time. That is my record, and that is how we do things in the West.Of course, I make my share of mistakes, too. As my daughters never tire of reminding me, putting on a robe does not make me any smarter. And I will never forget my first day on the job. Carrying a pile of briefs up the steps to the bench, I tripped on the hem of my robe and just about everything went flying.But troublesome as the robe can be, the robe does mean something to me, and not just that I can hide coffee stains on my shirt. Putting on a robe reminds us judges that it is time to lose our egos and open our minds. It serves, too, as a reminder of the modest station we judges are meant to occupy in a democracy. In other countries, judges wear scarlet, silk, ermine. Here, we judges, we buy our own plain black robes. And as Senator Sasse knows, I can attest the standard choir outfit at the local uniform supply store is a pretty good deal. Ours is a judiciary of honest black polyester.When I put on the robe, I am also reminded that, under our Constitution, it is for this body, the people’s representatives, to make new laws, for the Executive to ensure those laws are faithfully executed, and for neutral and independent judges to apply the law in the people’s disputes.If judges were just secret legislators, declaring not what the law is but what they would like it to be, the very idea of a government by the people and for the people would be at risk. And those who came before the court would live in fear, never sure exactly what the law requires of them, except for the judge’s will.As Alexander Hamilton said, liberty can have nothing to fear from judges who apply the law, but liberty has everything to fear if judges try to legislate, too.In my decade on the bench, I have tried to treat all who come before me fairly and with respect, and afford equal right to poor and to rich. I have decided cases for Native Americans seeking to protect Tribal lands, for class actions like one that ensured compensation for victims of a large nuclear waste pollution problem produced by corporations in Colorado. I have ruled for disabled students, for prisoners, for the accused, for workers alleging civil rights violations, and for undocumented immigrants. Sometimes, too, I have ruled against such persons. My decisions have never reflected a judgment about the people before me, only a judgment about the law and the facts at issue in each particular case.A good judge can promise no more than that, and a good judge should guarantee no less, for a judge who likes every outcome he reaches is probably a pretty bad judge, stretching for policy results he prefers rather than those the law compels.Mr. Chairman, as a student many years ago, I found myself walking through the Old Granary burial ground in Boston. It is where Paul Revere, John Hancock, and many of our Founders are buried. And there, I came across the tombstone of a lawyer and judge who today is largely forgotten, as we are all destined to be soon enough. His name was Increase Sumner. And written onto his tombstone over 200 years ago was this description of the man: ‘‘As a lawyer, he was faithful and able; as a judge, patient, impartial, and decisive. In private life, he was affectionate and mild; in publick life, he was dignified and firm. Party feuds were allayed by the correctness of his conduct; calumny was silenced by the weight of his virtues; and rancour softened by the amenity of his manners.’’Mr. Chairman, those words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve for me as a daily reminder of the law’s integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I could ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to you that I will do everything in my power to be that man.

Thank you, Senator. 

That is a softball, Mr. Chairman. I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party other than based on what the law and the facts in the particular case require, and I am heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that there is no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country.When I think of what judicial independence means, I think of Byron White. That is who I think of. I think of his fierce, rugged independence. He did his—he said, ‘‘I have a job.’’ People asked him what his judicial philosophy was, I will give the same answer. I decide cases.It is a pretty good philosophy for a judge. I listen to the arguments made. I read the briefs that are put to me. I listen to my colleagues carefully, and I listen to the lawyers in the well.And this experience has reminded me what it is like to be a lawyer in the well. It is a lot easier to ask the questions, I find, as a judge than it is to have all the answers as the lawyer in the well.So I take the process, the judicial process, very seriously. And I go through it step by step and keeping an open mind through the entire process as best as I humanly can, and I leave all the other stuff at home. And I make a decision based on the facts and the law.Those are some of the things judicial independence means to me. It means to me the judicial oath that I took—to administer justice without respect to persons, to do equal right to the poor and the rich, and to discharge impartially the duties of my office. It is a beautiful oath. It is a statutory oath written by this body. That is what judicial independence means to me.Happy to talk about the separation of powers, too, if you would like, Mr. Chairman, which you referenced in there. Or I am happy to answer another question. Entirely up to you.

Sure. On the first point, you know, I have decided, as I noted yesterday, over 2,700 cases, and my law clerks tell me that 97 percent of them have been unanimous. Ninety-nine percent I have been in the majority.They tell me as well that, according to the Congressional Research Service, my opinions have attracted the fewest number of dissents from my colleagues of anyone I have served with that they have studied over the last 10 years. Now the Congressional Research Service speculates whether that is because I am persuasive or I believe in collegiality. I do not see why it has to be a choice.My law clerks also tell me that in the few cases where I have dissented that I am as likely almost to dissent from a Democratappointed colleague as a Republican-appointed colleague, and that is again because we do not have Democrat or Republican judges.According to the Wall Street Journal, I am told that of the eight cases that they have identified that I have sat on that have been reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, our court was affirmed in seven of them. Now I think Louise might argue for the eighth because in that case, the Supreme Court did not like a procedural precedent of our court that, as a panel, we were bound to follow. So they remanded it back.We decided it on the merits, as the Court instructed. Cert. denied. Eight out of eight?On the separation of powers, it is, Mr. Chairman, the genius of the Constitution. Madison thought that the separation of powers was perhaps the most important liberty-guaranteeing device in the whole Constitution, and this is a point of civics that I do think maybe is lost today, how valuable the separation of powers is.That you have in Article I the people’s representatives make the law. That is your job. And I do not think it is an accident that the Framers put Article I first. Your job comes first. You make the law.Article II, the President’s job is to faithfully execute your laws. And our job, Article III, down at the bottom, is to make sure that the cases and controversies of the people are fairly decided.And if those roles were confused and power amalgamated, the Founders worried that would be the very definition of tyranny. And you can see why. Judges would make pretty rotten legislators.We are life tenured, right? You cannot get rid of us. It only takes a couple of us to make a decision, or 9, or 12, depending on the court. That would be a pretty poor way to run a democracy.And at the same time, with respect, legislators might not make great judges because they are answerable to the people. And when you come to a court with a case or a controversy about a past— past facts, you want a neutral, rigidly neutral, fair, scrupulously fair decisionmaker. You want somebody who is going to put politics aside.So the separation of powers I do not think has lost any of its genius over 200 years. In fact, it has proven it.

Well, Mr. Chairman, you are right. There were two lists, as I recall, over the summer. And I was not on the first list. And I remember having breakfast one day with a friend, who may be here. Bryan? There you are. You remember this? [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. We were having breakfast one day, and he said, ‘‘Neil, you are not on the list.’’ And I said, ‘‘You are right. I am not on the list.’’ He said, ‘‘You should be on the list.’’ And I said, ‘‘I love my life in Colorado. I would not change a thing. I am a happy man. I have a loving wife, beautiful home and children, a great job with wonderful colleagues. I am a happy person.’’ I am walking away from breakfast, and I get an email from Bryan saying, ‘‘There is a new list—’’ [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. ‘‘And you are on it.’’ That was the first I heard of it. 

I do not know about that. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. I do not think he—you did not know? I do not think we—we were all surprised. 

And at any rate, we are where we are.

Senator, I think you would be reassured by the process that unfolded. I try to live under a shell during the campaign season, watch baseball and football, go about my business. But I did hear lots of talk of litmus tests from all around. It was in the air.And I do not believe in litmus tests for judges. I have written about that years ago. I was not about to become party to such a thing.And I am here to report that you should be reassured because no one in the process, from the time I was contacted with an expression of interest for a potential interview to the time I was nominated, no one in that process, Mr. Chairman, asked me for any commitments, any kind of promises about how I would rule in any kind of case.

Absolutely, Senator. And if I might, Mr. Chairman, go back just a moment to promises? I have offered no promises on how I would rule in any case to anyone, and I do not think it is appropriate for a judge to do so, no matter who is doing the asking.And I do not because everybody wants a fair judge to come to their case with an open mind and to decide it on the facts and the law. One of the facts and one of the features of law that you have to decide it on is the basis of precedent, as you point out. And for a judge, precedent is a very important thing.We do not go reinvent the wheel every day. And that is the equivalent point of the law of precedent. We have an entire law about precedent, the law of judicial precedent. Precedent about precedent, if you will.And that is what that 800-page book is about. It expresses a mainstream consensus view of 12 judges from around the country appointed by, as you point out, Presidents of both parties, great minds. Justice Breyer was kind enough to write a foreword to it. It makes an excellent doorstop.[Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. And in it, we talk about the factors that go into analyzing precedent, any consideration of precedent, and there are a bunch of them. You have alluded to some of them. The age of the precedent, very important factor. The reliance interests that have built up around the precedent, has it been reaffirmed over the years? What about the doctrine around it? Has it built up, shored up, or has it become an island, as you point out? Those are all relevant considerations. Its workability is a consideration, too. Can people figure out how to abide it, or is it just too confusing for the lower courts in their administration? Those are all factors that a good judge will take into consideration when examining any precedent. You start with a heavy, heavy presumption in favor of precedent in our system. Alexander Hamilton who said that is one important feature. I think it was Hamilton who said one important feature of judges, if we are going to give them life tenure and allow them that extraordinary privilege, they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents. Francis Bacon called precedent the anchor of the law. So you start with that heavy presumption in favor of precedent. You consider those factors in that light. And yes, in a very few cases, you may overrule precedent. It is not an inexorable command, the Supreme Court has said. That is the law of precedent, as I understand it and I believe is expressed in that book with my very highly respected colleagues. 

Mr. Chairman, I do not think the considerations change. It is the same analysis that I would have as a SupremeCourt Justice, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, that I have when I am considering Circuit precedent as a Circuit Judge. It is the exact same process. The exact same rules apply.

I do, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator, I would respectfully respond that it is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and as a good judge, you do not approach that question anew, as if it had never been decided. That would be a wrong way to approach it. My personal views, I would also tell you, Mr. Chairman, belong over here. I leave those at home. Mr. Katyal yesterday said that what he wants is a fair judge, and that is what I wanted as a lawyer. I just wanted a judge to come in and decide on the facts and the law of my client’s case and leave what he had for breakfast at the breakfast table. And part of being a good judge is coming in and taking precedent as it stands, and your personal views about the precedent have absolutely nothing to do with the good job of a judge. 

And Senator, I would give you the same response. I know people have their views personally about lots of Supreme Court decisions and about a lot of other things. We are all human beings. I get that. I am not an algorithm. They have notyet replaced judges with algorithms, though I think eBay is trying and maybe successfully.We are all human beings. But the judge’s job is to put that stuff aside and approach the law as you find it, and that is part of the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court that I am sworn as a sitting judge to give the full weight and respect to due precedent.

Respectfully, Senator, I would give you the same answer. 

Mr. Chairman, it is certainly a seminal decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. There is no doubt about it. It is a very old decision of the Supreme Court now. It has been reaffirmed many times. There is a lot of reliance interest built around it. So I could talk to you about the factors that a good judge considers in analyzing precedent and the weight due a precedent, but I am not in a position to tell you whether I personally like or dislike any precedent. That is not relevant to my job. Gideon is a seminal precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and it deserves respect on that basis. Precedent is kind of like our shared family history as judges. It deserves our respect because it represents our collective wisdom. And to come in and think that just because I am new or the latest thing and know better than everybody who comes before me would be an act of hubris inappropriate to the judicial role. 

I know some people in this room have some opinions on that, I am sure, Senator. But as a judge, it is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and it deserves the same respect as other precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court when you are coming to it as a judge. And it has to be analyzed under the law of precedent. 

Senator, again, I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed. The reliance interest considerations are important there, and all of the other factors that go into analyzing precedent have to be considered.It is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was reaffirmed in Casey in 1992 and in several other cases. So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.

Senator, it is a precedent that is now 50 years old. Griswold involved the right of married couples to use contraceptive devices in the privacy of their own home.And it is 50 years old. The reliance interests are obvious. It has been repeatedly reaffirmed. All very important factors again in analyzing precedent.

It is, Senator. If I were to start telling you which are my favorite precedents or which are my least favorite precedents or if I view precedent in that fashion, I would be tipping my hand and suggesting to litigants that I have already made up my mind about their cases. That is not a fair judge.I did not want that kind of judge when I was a lawyer, and I do not want to be that kind of judge now. And I made a vow to myself I would not be. That is the fairness problem.And then the independence problem. If it looks like I am giving hints or previews or intimations about how I might rule, I think that is the beginning of the end of the independent judiciary, if judges have to make, effectively, campaign promises for confirmation. And respectfully, Senator, I have not done that in this process, and I am not about to start.

Good morning, Senator. 

I would be delighted to, Senator. Part of the value of precedent, it has lots of value. It has value, in and of itself, because it is our history, and our history has value intrinsically. But it also has an instrumental value in this sense. It adds to the determinacy of law. We have lots of tools that allow us to narrow the realm of admissible dispute between parties so that we can—people can anticipate and organize their affairs. It is part of the reason why the rule of law in this country works so well. We have statutes. We have rules. We have a fact-finding process and a judicial system that is the envy of the world. And precedent is a key part of that because, as the Chairman pointed out when he quoted an old piece of mine, once a case is settled, that adds to the determinacy of the law. What was once a hotly contested issue is no longer a hotly contested issue. We move forward. And Senator, the value of that is the U.S. Supreme Court takes something like 70 or 80 cases a year. That is a tiny fraction of all the disputes in our Federal legal system, right? 

My law clerks tell me it is something like .001 percent, and they are unanimous in those cases, which have divided Circuit Judges. That is why the Supreme Court largely takes the case, because it has divided us. It is one of the rare cases where we disagree. They are unanimous 40 percent of the time. 

Sure. 

Well, Senator, super precedent is—— 

It has been reaffirmed many times. I can say that. 

Yes. 

Senator, I would have to see the document. I do not recall. I have been sitting here.

It has been a long, long time. 

Fair enough. 

Sure. 

Thank you. 

Senator, I would want to see the email. Again, I do not feel comfortable commenting on documents that are not in front of me. But I can say this, that I do remember—— 

Great. 

That would be great.

Thank you. That would be wonderful. 

Okay. 

No, that is fine. I am happy to—— 

Of course. 

I would like to just know what I am talking about. My recollection generally from 12 years ago—— 

Thank you, Eric. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. My recollection generally, working on the Detainee Treatment Act, Senator, was that at that time after Rasul was issued by the Supreme Court, there were a lot of habeas petitions coming in from detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Some brought by my friend Neal Katyal. And there was an effort by some in the administration, along with many on Capitol Hill, to try and provide a regime for the processing of those claims in a way that would conform with the Youngstown ideal of Congress and the President acting together in unison, and that Senator McCain and Senator Graham put together legislation that emphasized that not only was torture unacceptable, which it always had been under U.S. law, but that cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment was also unacceptable under U.S. law. 

Yes. 

That is absolutely right, Senator. I sure did, and I am proud of it because we managed to come up with a bipartisan bill that I think passed this body with over 80 or maybe 90 votes, I do not remember, which did two things. One, affirmed this country’s commitment to prevent cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment and, second, which provided a regime that was agreed by the Congress and the President on how Guantanamo detainees should have their claims processed. 

Yes. 

Senator, you are absolutely right that it was eventually litigated, as all these things are. It was a bipartisan effort, and it was between the Department of Defense—Department of Defense wanted congressional approval for something so that they knew what the rules would be. They were desperate to have some congressional involvement and investment in this process.And as a lawyer—that is all I was. I was a lawyer for a client, right? I was advising them on how to go about doing that legally in conjunction with Senator Graham’s office and others.And it was a bipartisan effort, and we put together our best effort. The D.C. Circuit upheld it. The Supreme Court of the United States, eventually many, many years later, found that the process was insufficient, and that is the Boumediene case, as you know, Senator.But to say that there was no process would be inaccurate, too, because the Detainee Treatment Act had a long list of prescribed processes, and the question just simply was whether they were adequate enough under the suspension clause. And that was a close case that divided the Court very closely, and I respect that decision as a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court no less than any other, Senator.

Sure. 

Well, Senator, I can tell you what I recall. I have not read—— 

I need to read the email. But my loose recollection of something that happened I think 11, 12 years ago is that there were individuals in maybe the Vice President’s office who wanted a more aggressive signing statement along the lines that you have described and that there were others, including at the State Department, who wanted a gentler signing statement. And my recollection, sitting here, as best I can give it to you without studying the email, is that I was in the latter camp. John Bellinger, among others, I would have associated myself with there. And I do not know what was in the President’s head when he wrote the signing statement. I cannot tell you that. I do not know.I can only tell you what I remember, and I certainly would never have counseled anyone that they could disobey the law.

Sure. 

Sure. 

Senator, I am not suggesting you are. And I am—there was a tug of war among parties in the White House. 

Right. And—— 

Well, count me in with John Bellinger most of the time on these things, okay? 

All right? 

And that is my recollection. And Matt Waxman would be another one. And so that is my recollection, Senator, sitting here, and I will study these. 

Goodness, no, Senator. 

And I did not believe it at the time. What I was serving at the time, as I recall—again, my recollection, and I would be happy to review whatever you have before you—is that I was acting in the capacity as a speechwriter and taking material produced by the components that were responsible for litigating these issues, including Mr. Clement, Paul Clement, a dear friend of mine, and the Office of Legal Counsel and others and assembling it to put words together that sounded like English. And I think people like my writing, and that was my job. I think I was the scribe. 

Well, Senator, I think we have alluded to my difficulty here. I do think everything you just said is accurate. Both Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens wrote excellent opinions in that case.I am not here, though, to grade my bosses’ work. That would be kind of impertinent of me, I suspect, and certainly, I am sure they would think so. I also worry that saying I agree with one or the other will indicate to clients or to litigants in future cases—because it is now a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It is binding. It is the law.

Whether we like it or not, it is the law. And if I start saying I like one opinion or I like the other opinion, I am signaling—— 

Thank you. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, Heller makes clear the standard that we judges are supposed to apply. The question is whether it is a gun in common use for self-defense, and that may be subject to reasonable regulation. That is the test, as I understand it. There is lots of ongoing litigation about which weapons qualify under those standards, and I cannot prejudge that litigation sitting here. 

Are the statements out of the Heller decision from the United States—— 

Well, whatever is in Heller is the law, and I follow the law. 

Well, it is not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing, Senator, respectfully. It is a matter of it being the law. And my job is to apply and enforce the law.

I would begin by saying I hold Judge Wilkinson in high regard. He is a very fine man and a very fine judge.

No, I wish I could. 

But you know, the Supreme Court of the United States is not final because it is infallible, as Justice Jackson reminds us. It is infallible because it is final. And Judge Wilkinson had his view, and the Supreme Court has spoken, and Heller is the law of the land. And Judge Wilkinson may disagree with it, and I understand that. And he may—but he will follow the law no less than any other judge in America. I am confident of that. He is a very fine judge who takes his oath seriously. 

I understand, Senator. But again, if I indicate my agreement or disagreement with a past precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, I am doing two things that worry me sitting here.The first thing I am doing is I am signaling to future litigants that I cannot be a fair judge in their case because those issues keep coming up. All of these issues, as you point out, keep coming up. Issues around all of these precedents will be continued to be litigated and are hotly litigated. I have had post-Ledbetter Act cases in my court, for example.

Oh—— 

Senator, I really appreciate that, and I think there is a way you can take a look at this question without me potentially prejudging a case. And I appreciate your respect for that. And just to finish that thought. I am concerned that I have to look the litigant in the eye in the next case. And if I prejudge that case, they can look at me and say you are not a fair judge, and I have no answer for that. I have no answer for that. So what I think can give you comfort in this area is, Senator, I know a case or two has been mentioned yesterday. Respectfully, I would suggest that does not represent the body of my work. I have written 2,700—I have participated in 2,700 opinions over 101⁄2 years, and if you want cases where I have ruled for the little guy as well as the big guy, there are plenty of them, Senator. The Ute Indian Tribe—— 

Oh, goodness. 

I will name a bunch of them right now. 

I am sorry, Senator. Of course. Ute 5 and 6. Fletcher. The Rocky Flats case, which vindicated the rights of people who had been subject to pollution by large companies in Colorado, uranium pollution. I point you to the Magnesium case, similar pollution case in the Salt Lake City area. Colorado’s effort with renewable energy,upheld that. Orr v. City of Albuquerque, involving pregnancy discrimination in the police department in Albuquerque.W.D. Sports, a discrimination claim. Casey, Energy West, Crane. Simpson v. CU, involving young women who had been harassed by the football team. A.M., Browder, Sutton—I can give you a long, long list, Senator.

And Senator, the bottom line, I think, is that I would like to convey to you from the bottom of my heart that I am a fair judge. And I think if you ask people in the Tenth Circuit ‘‘Is he a fair judge?’’ you are going to get the answer that you got yesterday from both Senator Bennet and Senator Gardner and from General Katyal, and the same answer you got from Senator Allard and Senator Salazar 10 years ago.And Senator, I cannot guarantee you more than that, but I can promise you absolutely nothing less.

I am not aware of anything wrong with that, Senator. I have never suggested otherwise. 

I appreciate the opportunity to correct this misunderstanding, Senator. 

The case I think you are referring to is Gutierrez. 

It involved an undocumented immigrant to this country, okay? And the question was, there were two conflicting statutes. One said he could apply for immediate discretionary relief in this country from the Attorney General. The second said he had to wait outside the country for 10 years. We had a judicial precedent that said the first statute controls. That was the ruling of our court. After that, 3 or 4 years, I cannot remember exactly, the Board of Immigration Appeals, in its infinite wisdom, says our interpretation is wrong. Chevron—you have to undo your precedent, the judicial precedent that this man had relied upon and that he now hadto wait outside the country not just 10 years, but 13 or 14 because it took them so long to make up their mind.Well, Senator, that reminded me of, you know, when Charlie Brown is going in to kick the ball, and Lucy picks it up at the last second. And that struck me as raising serious due process concerns, fair notice and separation of powers concerns when an Executive bureaucracy can overturn a judicial precedent without an act of Congress.That is what the case was about, and it suggested, respectfully, Senator, that under the APA, the Administrative Procedures Act, this body tasked judges to decide legal questions and left to administrative agencies great deference when it comes to fact-finding, okay?That is how I read Section 706 is, fact-finding by scientists, biologists, chemists. The experts get great deference from the courts. The only question is who decides what the law is? And can a man like Mr. Gutierrez, the least amongst us, be able to rely on judicial precedent on the books, or can he have the ball picked up as he is going in for the kick?

Oh, I am sorry. 

No, I apologize. 

Senator, it is, though I have to confess, that lecture was attended by about 20 people, and it has a lot more attention since.[Laughter.] 

It is a limited, vital role in our separated powers. A judge is there to make sure that every person, poor or rich, mighty or meek, gets equal protection of the law. It is chiseled above the Supreme Court entrance in Vermont marble, though I believe the Lincoln Memorial is made out of Colorado marble. And that is a—that is a profound and radical promise, that every person is protected by our laws equally, and in all of human history, that may be the most radical promise in all of law. And what it means to me is that when I sit on the bench and someone comes to argue before me, I treat each one of them equally. They do not come as rich or poor, big guy or little guy. They come as a person. And I put my ego aside when I put on that robe, and I open my mind, and I open my heart, and I listen. And I tell my clerks that their very first and most important job is to tell me I am wrong and to persuade me I am wrong as I read the briefs and listen to the arguments. And if they manage to do that, I tell them their next job is to try and persuade me I am wrong again, because I want to make sure I leave no stone unturned. I want to get to the bottom of it. I have one client. It is law. And it is a great joy, and it is a great privilege, and it is a daunting responsibility to come in every day and to try and get it right. And then, I go listen to the arguments of the lawyers. I do not treat them as catspaws. They are not there to be toyed with. I treat them, I hope, always as respected colleagues who have lived with the arguments, studied the cases, know the facts far better than I do. I might actually learn something from them. I go in with the questions I actually have that I want answered, and then I sit and I listen to my colleagues after that. And, Senator Hatch, I cannot tell you how many times in the Tenth Circuit I have gone through that whole process. I go to conference, and I think I know my mind. And then one of my colleagues—Harris Hartz was here yesterday—he is often the one. There are plenty of others, who say something absolutely brilliant, changes my mind. And that is the judicial process, and that is the role I see for the appellate judge. 

Yes, Senator. I cannot tell you that when I go home and take off the robe I am not a human being and that I do not think about some of those cases. But my job is to apply the law as fairly as I can in each and every case without respect to persons. That is my oath.There is not every law in the book I love, you love. I am sure of that. But my job is not to write the laws, it is to apply the laws. And I try to do that, and that enough is enough for a day’s work, and it is enough for a life’s work.

Senator, I am just a person, and I remember how hard it is to be a lawyer. I remember what it was like to represent clients who had problems. I told my kids when they asked me what my job was when I was young, it is to help people with their problems, and as a judge, I have to resolve their problems. One of the hard things about being a judge is that somebody has to win and somebody has to lose. You make half the people unhappy 100 percent of the time. That is the job description. But you have to believe in something larger than yourself and that you are part of something larger than yourself. And I believe in the rule of law in this country, and I believe an independent judiciary is one of the keys to it. And I feel it has been a calling to be part of it and an honor. 

May I offer an example, Senator, I think might be helpful? 

I take United States v. Jones, a recent case from the U.S. Supreme Court, involving whether police officers might attach a GPS tracking device to a car, modern technology. How do you apply the original Constitution written 200 years ago to that?And the Court went back and looked at the law 200 years ago. And one of the things it found was that attaching something to someone else’s property is a trespass to chattels, a common law, and would be considered a search. And the Court held that if that is a trespass to chattels in a search 200 years ago, it has to be today, though the technology is obviously different.So, the technology changes, but the principles do not. And it cannot be the case that the United States Constitution is any less protective of the people’s liberties today than it was the day it was drafted.

Well, Senator, I think it is actually a very similar sort of question, right? We look back, we find what the law was at the time, the original understanding, if you will, and we make analogies to our current circumstance. We judges love analogies. We work with analogies, and that is how lawmaking through the judicial process happens. That is proper judicial decisionmaking.It is a very different thing if you want to create a revolution in the area and change the law dramatically. That is for this body to do. It is for judges to interpret the law as best they can from the original understanding to current circumstances, and apply it to current circumstances.So, in Meshworks that is exactly what we did, and looked at old case law having to do with copyright and applied it to digital media, the same principles from the beginning of the Copyright Act, just applied to a new medium.

Senator, Marbury v. Madison is the cornerstone of——

Of the law in this country. I do not know anybody who wants to go back and reconsider that. I hope not. 

Senator, a good judge does not give a whit about politics or the political implications of his or her decision, decides where the law takes him or her fearlessly. I walk past every day a bust of Byron White in my courthouse. My courthouse is named for Byron White. And when I do that, I think about his absolute determination just to get it right, no matter where it took him. He said, it is a job. You do your very best, and you go home, and that is how I approach things. And if you look at my record, Senator, respectfully, I think it demonstrates that. According to my law clerks again, when I do dissent, which is very rarely, I do so in about equal numbers between judges who happen to be appointed by Democrat Presidents and who happen to be appointed by Republican Presidents. And I hate to even use those words because they are all just to me judges. I do not think of them that way. But my decisions have always been independent, regardless of who I am agreeing or disagreeing with. And have I ruled againstthe Government? My goodness. Ask the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colorado. I give them a pretty hard time. I make them square their corners, Senator Hatch, all right? And if you want to some examples, I would point you to Carloss, Krueger, Ackerman, three recent Fourth Amendment cases ruling for the accused, the least amongst us, against the Government.

Well, again, it goes to our separation of powers. Judges would make very poor legislators. We are not equipped for it. We are not responsive to the people. Cannot elect us, cannot get rid of us. You are stuck with us. And we do not have the opportunities to talk to people, to have hearings like this one in places like this.I am permitted four law clerks for 1 year at a time right out of a law school. It is kind of an evanescent crowd. It replenishes itself every year. Now, if you were to make laws, I do not think you would design a system where you let three older people with four young law clerks straight out of law school legislate for a country of 320 million. That is just not how anyone would design the railroad. And so, those are some of the problems I see, Senator.

With all respect to my law clerks. I love them very much. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. They are like family, but they are not the same as your staffs and the investigative powers you have. 

Well, I would say that in that article—I would say a couple things about it. First, as I pointed out and I believe, the courts are a very important place for the vindication of civil rights and for minorities. 

It is a place where unpopular voices get heard the same as popular voices. In a democracy and the legislature, majorities win. That is not the case in courts. The best argument should prevail. So, they play an important role. And, second, I pointed out that one thing that we lack as judges to make good policy decisions as legislators is the ability to com-promise. These bodies, legislative bodies, you can put together a compromise. Judges, somebody has to win, somebody has to lose, Senator. It is not a great place to compromise, and, again, we are not great—we are not well-equipped to do your work.At the same time, I did criticize—I pointed out a column by a liberal columnist, self-identified liberal columnist, very fine man, and I agreed with him that his side had done some—spent perhaps too much time in court instead of in front of the legislature. I can report to you, having lived longer, as I did report to you in 2006, that the problem lies on both sides of the aisle, that I see lots of people who resort to court perhaps more quickly than perhaps they should.

It is, and I am grateful that David is here today with me. 

Senator, I represent—I wanted to go to a place where I could represent plaintiffs as well as defendants, not pick one side of the ‘‘v.’’ I thought that would make me a better lawyer, and I would see more of life that way, and I did. And we represented small plaintiffs. My very first trial, I represented a man who bought a gravel pit, and the prior owner would not leave, and he stole the gravel, and we had to kick him out. And then he brought a bunch of lawsuits, we thought malicious use of process, trying to kick my guy out. Well, we found an old statute that said when you furtively mine another person’s property, you get statutory damages. It was quite an unexpected find. It was like a hundred-year-old law, no furtive mining, the no furtive mining statute. And we brought suit, and we won a claim for conversion and malicious use of process, among other things, in county court. It may have been one of the highlights of my career when one of the jurors came up afterwards and said to me, son, you are a young Perry Mason. [Laughter.]Judge GORSUCH. That was my first trial, Senator. I represented large defendants. I represented large plaintiffs as well, along with a very significant team, my partners. We won what was at that time—I do not know if it still is, they probably have done better now—the largest plaintiff side antitrust verdict that had been affirmed in American history.We represented class actions of consumers, some dry holes, some successful, all sorts of clients—individuals, companies, nonprofits. Represented pension funds, public employee pension funds, a variety of clients. It was a great and wonderful practice, and I loved every minute of it.

Sir, I am heartened by that article. I had not read that one, and—— 

But to answer your question, when I became a judge, they gave me a gavel, not a rubber stamp, and nobody comes to my court expecting a rubber stamp. 

Senator, our job there was to apply the statute as best as we could understand its purpose as expressed in its text. And I think every judge who faced that case, everyone, found it a hard case and did their level best, and that is all any judge can promise or guarantee. I respect all of my colleagues who addressed that case.

Well, I might give you even a couple other examples of RFRA’s application that I have been involved in that might shed some light on this. It is the same statute that applies not just to Hobby Lobby. It also applies to Little Sisters of the Poor and protects their religious exercise. And it has also been applied in a case where I appointed counsel because I saw something potentially meritorious there. And our court held it applied to a Muslim prisoner in Oklahoma who was denied a halal meal. 

It is also the same law that protects the rights of a Native American prisoner who was denied access to his prison sweat lodge, and appeared solely in retribution for a crime that he committed, and it was a heinous crime, but it protects him, too. And I wrote those decisions as well, Senator, yes. I wrote the Native American prisoner case, and I participated in and I wrote a concurrence in the Muslim prisoner case. 

No. 

I associate myself with the approach I think all good judges attempt, to follow the law wherever it leads.

Very much so, Senator. Whenever I see his name attached to an opinion, it is one I read with special care. He is an outstanding judge. 

Senator, as I explained to you before, I cannot get involved in politics. And there are judicial canons that prevent me from doing that, and I think it would be very imprudent of judges to start commenting on political disputes between themselves or the various branches. 

Senator, I can tell you that the Supreme Court of the United States has a lot of precedent in this area, as you are well aware, quite a lot of it permitting Congress to compel disclosure, to limit contributions, and a lot of other case law in this area. There is a lot of precedent in this area.

Senator, that was exactly what was at issue in part in Austin, and then again in Citizens United. And the Supreme Court issued a variety of opinions on that subject, on that very subject, looking back to the original understanding of the First Amendment to see whether it embraced the speech at issue in those cases. And different Justices came to different conclusions on that score.

Well, Senator—— 

I think there is an awful lot in the Federalist Papers and elsewhere that were relevant to and considered by both concurrences and dissents in Citizens United. 

I do not remember that term, no, Senator. 

I trust you. 

Entirely. [Laughter.] 

Not that much? [Laughter.] 

Senator, I think there is lots of room for legislation in this area that the Court has left. The Court indicated that if, you know, proof of corruption can be demonstrated, that a different result may be obtained on expenditure limits.

I am not sure I tracked the question, Senator. I am sorry.

I think Citizens United made clear that quid pro quo corruption remains a vital concern and is subject for potential legislation. And I think there is ample room for this body to legislate, even in light of Citizens United, whether it has to do with contribution limits, whether it has to do with expenditure limits, or whether it has to do with disclosure requirements.

I think Justice Kennedy would agree with you, yes.

I would follow the law, and that is my understanding—that would certainly fall within my understanding of the law. 

All right. I will trust you there, too, Senator. 

Senator, with respect to my nomination, as I recall—— 

Yes, yes. As I recall, all of my clients, or an awful lot of them, came out of the woodwork to say nice, supportive things about me. And Phil Anschutz was one, and I think there areprobably letters in there from the fellow with the gravel pit, too, and——

Senator—— 

Senator, I think what they probably listened to was the fact that they had seen me in action at the Department of Justice. That is my guess if you ask me to guess, but that is a guess because I did not make the decision. 

Senator, this is an issue that is currently being litigated actively, as you know, and I—— 

Senator, we have a free exercise clause that protects the free exercise of religious liberties by all persons in this country. If you are asking me how I would apply it to a specific case, I cannot talk about that for understandable reasons. 

The understandable reasons, just so I am frank and candid with you as I can be. Senator, when you ask me to apply it to a set of facts that look an awful lot like a pending case in many Circuits now, my worry—— 

Senator—— 

We have a Constitution, and it does guarantee free exercise. It also guarantees equal protection of the laws and a whole lot else besides. And the Supreme Court in Zadvydas has held that due process rights extend even to undocumented persons in this country, okay? I will apply the law. I will apply the lawfaithfully and fearlessly, and without regard to persons. I do not care——

Anyone, any law is going to get a fair and square deal with me. My job as a judge is to treat litigants who appear in front of me as I wished to be treated when I was a lawyer with my client, large or small. I did not want them discriminated against because they were a large company or a small individual with an unpopular belief. And that is the kind of judge I have tried to be, Senator, and I think that is my record. 

I need to know more specifics. 

Oh, Senator, that would—that would be inappropriate, yes. That is against the law. That is against the law. 

Senator, we have the Religious—— 

Senator, we have not just the First Amendment free exercise clause in this country, very important protection. We have not just the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, gender, ethnicity. We also have the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that Senator Hatch mentioned, which was a bipartisan bill passed by this body with the support of Senator Kennedy and Senator Schumer when he was in the House. And that imposes an even higher standard on the Government than the First Amendment when it comes to religious discrimination. It says that there—if there is any sincerely held religious belief, earnestly held religious belief, the Government must meet strict scrutiny before it may regulate on that basis, strict scrutiny being the highest standard known in American law. 

Senator, a lot of people say a lot of silly things. 

My grandfather——

Senator, he has no idea how I would rule in that case. And, Senator, I am not going to say anything here that would give anybody any idea how I would rule in any case like that could come before the Supreme Court or my court of the Tenth Circuit. It would be grossly improper of a judge to do that.It would be a violation of the separation of powers and judicial independence if someone sitting at this table, in order to get confirmed, had to make promises or commitments about how they would rule in a case that is currently pending and likely to make its way to the Supreme Court.

Senator, no man is above the law. 

Senator, as a judge—as a judge, I apply the law, and the law here I think is Youngstown. I look to Justice Jackson, okay, and Justice Jackson wrote a brilliant opinion in Youngstown. Now, it is really important to know who he was. He was the fiercest—— 

I know you did. I know you did. Well, I know— we talked about it. And, you know, here was the fiercest advocate of Executive power as FDR’s Attorney General. Fierce advocate of Executive power. And when he became a judge, he said, ‘‘The robe changes a man or it should.’’ And you go from being an advocate to being a neutral adjudicator. In the Youngstown system of analysis when it comes to presidential power and foreign affairs, has three categories. One, the President acting with the concurrence of Congress. That is when the President is acting at his greatest strength because there are shared responsibilities in our Constitution. He has Commander-inChief power. This body has power of the purse and the power to declare war assigned to it in Article I. When the—when the Congress and the President are in disagreement, that is the other end of the spectrum. The President there is acting with the—at the lowest ebb of his authority. And when Congress is silent, that is the gray area in between. That is how a court, as opposed to a lawyer or advocate, approaches the problem. 

Well, have a Convention Against Torture and implementing legislation which ban torture. We have the Detainee Treatment Act, which we talked about earlier, which bans cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. We also happen to have an Eighth Amendment.

Senator, no man is above the law. 

Senator, as a judge, before I even try to decide a question like that, I would want briefs and argument, and I would want to go through the whole judicial process. I would not begin to try and attempt to offer an off-the-cuff opinion like that. 

No man is above the law, Senator. 

Senator, I cannot issue advisory opinions at this table in cases or controversies and how they would come out. 

And I just—I cannot do it. It would not be responsible. 

But every law that this body passes I take seriously. I respect this body, and nobody is above the law in this country, and that includes the President of the United States. 

Senator, my recollection is that Mr. Bybee was long gone from the Department before I ever showed up, and that by the time I got there, the Department and the President were willing to work with Congress to try and establish a regime that would govern operations at Guantanamo. That is my recollection.And my role was a lawyer and predominately overseeing litigation filed by others against the Government. I had a role as a lawyer, a significant one, but I was not a policymaker, Senator.

Senator, Hamdan, I recall, was a decision that passed in the first instance on the Detainee Treatment Act. So, to the extent I was involved and providing advice as a lawyer about the Detainee Treatment Act, I am sure, yes. 

Senator, I admire the various ways—— [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. You would be a formidable companion in the courtroom. 

Oh, he should. 

Yes, right. I have heard that story. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. Whenever a lawyer says, ‘‘I am just a lawyer from a small town,’’ watch out. He is about—last time—you got to watch your wallet, because it is gone quickly in my experience. And I might have played that line once or twice myself. 

Well, no, Senator, I am happy to say Shelby is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a recent one. It is a controversial one. I understand that. What its precedential reach will prove to be remains to be seen because, for example, as I read it, the decision left room for Congress to legislate in this area if it wishes, to make new findings, and to express a new possible regime for Section Four and Section Five coverage. And that possibility is live and could yield further litigation, undoubtedly would. 

Senator, I would tell you that my record on class actions, I think, will reflect, if you look, and I know you have, that I represented class actions. I represented people fighting classactions. I have ruled against class actions, and I have ruled for class actions. And in each case, it depends upon the facts and the law presented to me.The most recent class action case, significant one that I can think of, involved residents who live near Rocky Flats, a uranium processing plant that made nuclear weapons outside of Denver. And those folks filed a class action for damage to their property, and it took 25 years for that case bouncing up and down and back and forth across the legal system before I finally issued a decision saying stop, enough, they win. They had a trial, a jury found for them, and they win. Finish the lawsuit.And I believe it has been finished, and I believe they have been finally paid, though, of course it has been so long, many of them, it is their children who are getting the money.

We are okay. [Laughter.] 

Yes, Senator. 

Not until my interview. 

No, Senator. 

Senator, I would have walked out the door. It is not what judges do. They do not do it at that end of Pennsylvania Avenue, and they should not do it at this end either, respectfully. 

Thank you, Senator, for those very kind words. 

Senator, all I know is that there are a lot of young men and women out there in harm’s way so that we may sit here and have this conversation. 

I am sure that is right. 

Certainly not, Senator. 

Senator, that was a question that the Court struggled with in the Hamdi case, as you know. 

We did. 

That is right, Senator. 

There are certainly people who believe that, Senator. 

Yes, Senator. I believe it is. 

Yes. 

There is certainly legal authority suggesting that, Senator. 

That is correct, Senator. Of course, this body plays a role too.

That is the separation of powers at work. 

I do. 

That is absolutely correct, Senator. 

As a lawyer? 

I was not a policymaker, but I did advise. 

As did many others. There were many other very fine lawyers too, Senator, who advised the administration that engaging Congress would be a good idea, because we had read our Youngstown and our Justice Jackson. 

That is my recollection, and that is about all I can recall.

That is my understanding, Senator. Along the way, your legislation did prevail in the D.C. Circuit, and in the Supreme Court, of course, it was a close call. It was 5– 4, as I recall. 

You are not going to get me to commit on that one either. 

Yes, Senator. 

That is right. 

Well, Senator, there are—— 

There are, as you know, rules about that, too. 

Laws about that. 

To challenge precedent? 

Every person is allowed to come to court to bring whatever claim they have. That is how our system works. 

You are exactly right, Senator. 

The holding of Roe v. Wade, in 30 seconds, Senator, is that a woman has a right to an abortion. It developed a trimester scheme in Roe that specified when the state’s interests and when the woman’s interests tend to prevail. 

That was the scheme set forth. 

Well, that is the test that the Court came around and applied in Casey in 1992. 

And so viability became more of the touchstone rather than a rigid—— 

Senator, I am not a scientist or a doctor. 

Senator, I can promise you no more than that, and I guarantee you no less than that, in every single case that comes before——

Yes, Senator. 

Senator, yes. I see that having all sorts of constitutional problems, under current law. 

Yes, Senator. That is my recollection of it.

Senator, the impeachment power belongs to this body. 

Senator, I am not going to speculate. 

No man is above the law. 

No man. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, that would not fit quite with my recollection. 

My recollection is that Senator McCain and Senator Graham wrote the legislation with input from the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice, and a whole lot of others besides. And I was one voice among a great many, and that in terms of when it was struck down, Hamdan held that the Detainee Treatment Act did not apply retroactively, it only applied prospectively; and then several years later—gosh, I want to say it was 2008, maybe?—the Court came back around in Boumediene. 

Senator, I have not had a chance to look at that. I am sorry. I just scarfed down a sandwich over the break, and I will be happy to read it, but I am not sure what I can answer you, here sitting, off the top of my head. It was 12 years ago, and I am doing the best I can with my recollection. My recollection——

Exactly. 

I think the Department of Justice has produced something like 200,000 pages of stuff. 

Sitting here, that would be my understanding, Senator. 

Okay. 

Senator, I can talk about my record, and I can tell you that as a Federal judge, when a defendant comes to court with an allegation that the sentencing judge made improper comments based on his ethnicity, me and my colleagues—my colleagues and I have removed that judge from the case. I can tell you that when an immigration lawyer fails to provide competent counsel time and time again, I have sent him to the bar for discipline. I can tell you that when it comes to access to justice, I have written on this topic; I have worked on this topic for the last 6 years,together with many wonderful people on the Rules Committee, trying to make our civil litigation system cheaper and faster, because it takes too long for people to exercise their Seventh Amendment liberties.And I can tell you together with my colleagues, when we found that the level of representation of inmates on death row was unacceptable in our Circuit, a whole bunch of us—I cannot take too much credit—tried to do something about it.I can tell you that when prisoners come to court, pro se, handwritten complaints, and I see something that might be meritorious in them, I appoint counsel. That is my record, Senator.

Sure. He was my dissertation supervisor. 

Whenever I went to Oxford, so it would have been 1990—— 

Well, it could have been two or three. Somewhere in there. 

He was my dissertation supervisor, and I would describe that as a relationship between teacher and student, and he was a very generous teacher, particularly generous with his red ink on my papers. I remember sitting next to the fire in his Oxford office, like something out of ‘‘Harry Potter,’’ and he always had a coal fireplace burning, and sometimes whether I was being raked over the coals. He did not let an argument that I was working on go unchallenged from any direction. 

Whatever it is, it is, yes. 

Last time I saw him, gosh, when he—I know I saw him when he retired, and there was a party held in his honor. And I remember seeing him then, and that was a couple of years ago. 

I do not know. It must have at some point come out in our conversations. I do not know when. 

He did not write my book, Senator. 

He did not help write my book. I wrote my book. I certainly expressed gratitude to my dissertation supervisor in a book that is basically my dissertation. 

And there were a lot of drafts, Senator. I mean, golly, that was a very tough degree. That was the most rigorous academic experience of my life, and I had to pass not just him butan internal examiner and an external examiner, and that was hard. That was hard.

Oh, yes. Yes. 

Well, and Oxford has a stable—and it is part of the reason why it was such a privilege. I mean, here I was a kid from Colorado, and I have a scholarship to go to Oxford. I had never been to England, to Europe before. And at Oxford at that time, they had John Finnis, Joe Raz, Ronald Dworkin. H.L.A. Hart was even still alive then. 

Nope. 

Nope. Not to my recollection. 

Senator, I am not here to answer for Mr. King or for Professor Finnis. We—— 

Senator, before I expressed any view on that, I would want to read it, and I would want to read it from beginning to end—— 

Not an excerpt. And, Senator, I have had a lot of professors. I have been blessed with some wonderful professors. And I did not agree with everything they said, and I would not expect them to agree with everything I have said. 

Senator, I know he testified in the Romer case. I cannot say sitting here I recall the specifics of his testimony or that he gave a deposition. 

Well, I guess, Senator, I think the best evidence is what I have written. I have written over—oh, gosh, written or joined over 6 million words as a Federal appellate judge. I have written a couple of books. I have been a lawyer and a judge for 25 or 30 years. That is my record, and I guess I would ask you respectfully to look at my credentials and my record, and some of the examples I have given you are from my record about the capital habeas work, about access to justice. I have spoken about overcriminalization publicly. Those are things I have done, Senator. 

Well, Senator, there are—what about them? 

They are people, and—— 

Senator, I have tried to treat each case and each person as a person—not a this kind of person, not a that kind of person. A person. Equal justice under law. It is a radical promise in the history of mankind. 

Senator, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that single-sex marriage is protected by the Constitution. 

Senator, I would agree with you it is highly inappropriate. 

Senator, it sounds like a potential hypothetical case that might be a case or controversy I might have to decide, and I would not want to prejudge it sitting here at the confirmation table. I can tell you it would be inappropriate. 

Senator, those are not my words, and I would never have said them.

And I am telling you I do not. 

Senator, there are a lot of words there, and if you are asking me to parse them out and give you a legal opinion— and I fear that you may be—I would respectfully say I would have to study it in the course of a judicial case. 

Senator, I would need to—it sounds like you are asking me about a case or a controversy, and with all respect, when we come to cases and controversies, a good judge will listen. Socrates said the first virtue of a good judge is to listen courteously and decide impartially. 

No. This one I do not. 

No, Senator, and I would be delighted to actually clear this up.

Because the first I heard of this was the night before my confirmation hearing. I have been teaching legal ethics at the University of Colorado for 7 or 8 years. It has been a great honor and pleasure. I teach from a standard textbook that every professor—well, I do not know if every professor—a number of professors at CU and elsewhere use. It is an excellent textbook, Professors Lerman and Schrag. One of the chapters in the book confronts lawyers with some harsh realities that they are about to face when they enter the practice of law. As you know and I know, we have an unhappy and unhealthy profession in a lot of ways. Lawyers commit suicide at rates far higher than the population. Alcoholism, divorce, depression are also at extremely high rates. Young lawyers also face the problem of having enormous debts when they leave law school, and that is a huge inhibition for them to be able to do public service like you and I are so privileged to be able to do. We talk about those things. There is one problem in the book, and I would be happy to share with you the book and the teacher’s manual so that you can see for yourself, Senator, which asks a question, and it is directed to young women, because, sadly, this is a reality they sometimes face. The problem is this: Suppose an older partner woman at the firm that you are interviewing at asks you if you intend to become pregnant soon. What are your choices as a young person? You can say yes, tell the truth—the hypothetical is that it is true—and not get the job and not be able to pay your debts. You can lie, maybe get the job. You can say no. That is a choice, too. It is a hard choice. Or you can push back in some way, shape, or form. And we talk about the pros and the cons in a Socratic dialogue so that they can think through for themselves how they might answer that very difficult question. And, Senator, I do ask for a show of hands—not about the question you asked but about the following question, and I ask it of everybody: How many of you have had questions like this asked of you in the employment environment, an inappropriate question about your family planning? And I am shocked every year, Senator, how many young women raise their hand. It is disturbing to me. I knew this stuff happened when my mom was a young practicing lawyer, graduating law school in the 1960s. At age 20, she had to wait for a year to take the bar. I knew it happened with Justice O’Connor, could not get a job as a lawyer when she graduated Stanford Law School and had to work as a secretary. I am shocked it still happens every year that I get women, not men, raising their hand to that question. Thank you for the opportunity to clarify that, Senator. 

We better be. Senator, a wise old judge, kind of like Judge Johnson, you are going to hear from; he is going to come talk to you, from Colorado, a hero of mine, known me since I was a tot. He taught me that the test of the rule of law is whether the Government can lose in its own courts and accept the judgment of those courts. That does not happen everywhere else around the world. We take it for granted in this country. It is a remarkable blessing from our forefathers, and it is a daunting prospect as a judge to have to carry that baton. And to do it on the Supreme Court of the United States is humbling, that prospect, to me. And I pledge to you that I will do everything I can to uphold the Constitution and the laws, as a good judge should, at all times.

Senator, this is one of those you take home at night. The law said that the man is protected and cannot be fired if he refuses to operate an unsafe vehicle. The facts of the case, at least as I understood them, was that Mr. Maddin chose to operate his vehicle, to drive away and, therefore, was not protected by the law. He would be protected if he refused to operate, but he chose to operate. Now, Senator——

Right. 

I said more than that, Senator. I said—— 

Senator, all I can tell you is my job is to apply the law you write. The law as written said that he would be protected if he refused to operate. And I think by any plain understanding, he operated the vehicle. And if Congress wishes to revise the law, I wrote this—I wrote, I said it was an unkind decision. I said it may have been a wrong decision, a bad decision. But my job is not to write the law, Senator. It is to apply the law. And if Congress passes a law saying a trucker in those circumstances gets to choose how to operate his vehicle, I will be the first one in line to enforce it. I have been stuck on a highway in Wyoming in a snowstorm. I know what is involved. I do not make light of it. I take it seriously. But, Senator, this gets back to what my job is and what it is not. And if we are going to pick and choose cases out of 2,700, I can point you to so many in which I have found for the plaintiff in an employment action or affirmed a finding of an agency of some sort for a worker or otherwise. You know, I would point you, for example, to W.D. Sports or Casey, Energy West, Crane, Simpson v. CU. That is just a few that come to mind that I have scratched down here on a piece of paper. 

Senator, I take every case that comes before me very seriously. I take the responsibility entrusted in me in my current position very grave. I think if you ask the lawyers and judges at the Tenth Circuit am I a serious and careful judge, I think you will hear that I am. And I am delighted to have an opportunity to talk to you about that decision.As you know, in RFRA, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Congress was dissatisfied with the level of protection afforded by the Supreme Court under the First Amendment to religious exercise. The Court, in a case called Smith v. Maryland, written by Justice Scalia, said any neutral law of general applicability is fine. That does not offend the First Amendment. So laws banning the use of peyote, Native Americans, tough luck, even though it is essential to their religious exercise, for example.This Congress decided that was insufficient protection for religion and, in a bill sponsored by Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer when he was in the House, wrote a very, very strict law, and it says that any sincerely held religious belief cannot be abridged by the Government without a compelling reason, and even then it has to meet—it has to be narrowly tailored, strict scrutiny, the highest legal standard known in American law.Okay. I have applied that same law, RFRA and RLUIPA—they are companion statutes—to Muslim prisoners in Oklahoma who seek halal meals, to Native Americans who wish to use an existingsweat lodge in Wyoming, and to Little Sisters of the Poor. Hobby Lobby came to court and said, ‘‘We deserve protections, too. We are a small family held company.’’ A small number of people who own it, I mean. They exhibit their religious affiliations openly in their business. They pipe in Christian music. They refuse to sell alcohol or things that hold alcohol. They close on Sundays though it costs them a lot. And they came to court and said, ‘‘We are entitled to protection, too, under that law.’’It is a tough case. We looked at the law, and it says any person with a sincerely held religious belief is basically protected, except for strict scrutiny. What does ‘‘person’’ mean in that statute? Congress did not define the term. So what does a judge do? A judge goes to the Dictionary Act, as you alluded to, Senator. The Dictionary Act is an act prescribed by Congress that defines terms when they are not otherwise defined. That is what a good judge does. He does not make it up. He goes to the Dictionary Act.In the Dictionary Act, Congress has defined ‘‘person’’ to include corporation. So you cannot rule out the possibility that some companies can exercise religion. And, of course, we know churches are often incorporated, and we know nonprofits like Little Sisters or hospitals can practice religion. In fact, the Government in that case conceded that nonprofit corporations can exercise religion. Conceded that. So that is the case.Then we come to the strict scrutiny side. 

Oh, I am sorry. 

Oh, I do not want to get you in trouble. 

I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. 

Okay. All right. So then you have the religion, the first half of the test met. All right? So then you go to the second half. Does the Government have a compelling interest in the ACA in providing contraceptive care? The Supreme Court of the United States said we assume yes; we take that as given. And then the question becomes: Is it narrowly tailored to require the Green family to provide it? And the answer there the Supreme Court reached, and precedent binding on us now, and we reached in anticipation, is no, that it was not as strictly tailored as it could be because the Government had provided different accommodations to churches and other religious entities. The Greens did not want to have to write down and sign something saying that they were permitting the use of devices they thought violated their religious beliefs. And the Government had accommodated that with respect to other religious entities and could not provide an explanation why it could not do the same thing here. And that is the definition of ‘‘strict scrutiny.’’ Now, Congress can change the law. It can go back to Smith v. Maryland if it wants to, eliminate RFRA altogether. It could say that only natural persons have rights under RFRA. It could lowerthe test on strict scrutiny to a lower degree of review if it wished. It has all of those options available, Senator, and if we got it wrong, I am sorry. But we did our level best, and we were affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and it is a dialogue like any statutory dialogue between Congress and the courts.

I get a lot worse. I have a lot worse the other day. 

That is the easiest question of the day, Senator. Thank you. No. And I have to correct myself. Senator Durbin, it is not Smith v. Maryland. That is third-party doctrine. It is Employment Division v. Smith that we are talking about. I apologize to you for that. 

I think so, Senator, to the best of my recollection. 

Senator, your understanding of events is a lot fresher than mine, but sitting here, I cannot disagree with anything you have said.

Something like that. 

I really appreciate this opportunity and venue to be talking about these things because these I care about and I can talk about as a judge.I wrote that article in conjunction with some input from a lot of wonderful people, so I cannot take total credit for it. And I thank them, and you can see who I thank.My point there was threefold, starting with the fact that too few people can get to court with legitimate grievances today. That is a fact. Too few people can get lawyers to help them with their problem. I teach young folks law who leave law school unable to afford their own services. Think about that. Think about that. And hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. How do they go be Main Street lawyers? How do they help people who need legal services?And I pointed to three potential sources of problems where we lawyers maybe should look internally rather than blame others for the problem. There is plenty of blame to go around. I am not a big blame guy. But I am a look-inside guy. And what do I see in our profession? There are three things that I pointed to in that article.First, our own ethical rules. It is a very unusual profession where we are allowed to regulate ourselves. It is quite an extraordinary privilege. Usually it is the legislature, right? But lawyers basically regulate themselves. And do all of our ethical rules necessarily help our clients or do some of them help us more than they help our clients?And I point to some that, for instance, regarding the unauthorized practice of law, why is it you have to be a lawyer to help parents with disabled children in administrative proceedings to seek relief under IDEA? That was an example I pointed to.Why is it that every time certain companies that provide online legal services for basic things get sued every time they move into a new State?Why is it I can go to Walmart and get my hair, teeth, eyes taken care of but I cannot get a landlord-tenant contract drawn up?Those are all results of our ethical rules, and I am not sure whether they are worth the price that we pay for them. It is estimated, I have heard—I cannot verify it—that our ethical rules result in a $10 billion a year surplus to lawyers from clients every year. That was one.Number two was our own rules of procedure which yield cases like the one we talked about that took 25 years to resolve. That is wrong. That is wrong. We should be able to resolve cases in less time than it takes for my law clerks to be born, raised, and get through law school.And the third thing I pointed to was our legal educational system, where we have 3 years of post-graduate education for everybody who wants to have anything to do with lawyering. The best lawyer in the country in this history came from your State, Senator Durbin, and he did not ever go to law school. And he always said the best way to become a lawyer, read the books. Still true.And other countries around the world do not have 3 years of post-graduate legal education. Now, this is where Justice Scalia and I—this is a disagreement. He thought 3 years was necessary for everybody. I am not convinced. In England, where I studied, you could become a lawyer through 3 years of an undergraduate degree or 1 year as a post-graduate degree, all followed by a lot of on-the-job practical training. And I wonder whether all that debt is worth it or whether it induces people to pick jobs that they have to pick to pay their debt rather than to serve the people they would like to serve.Those are the problems I talk about in that article. 

I think it is a problem when 80 percent of the American College of Trial Lawyers, the best lawyers in the country, arguably—they certainly think they are. Sorry. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. When 80 percent of them say that good claims are priced out of court and 70 percent of them say that cases are settled based on litigation costs rather than the merits of the litigation, that is a problem both ways. And these are lawyers who operate on both sides of the ‘‘v.’’ 

Ordinarily. Some do. What we are seeing today, though, Senator, is an explosion of pro se, that is, filings by the person without a lawyer. And that is what I was trying to address there. I do think access to justice in large part means access to a lawyer. Lawyers make a difference. I believe that firmly. My grandpa showed that to me, what a difference a lawyer can make in a life. 

I do, and we have talked a little bit about it with Senator Feinstein, and I would be happy to—— 

So, Senator, in that case there were two statutes that this undocumented immigrant faced. He was trying to remain in the country.One statute said that he had the right to apply for immediate discretionary relief from the Attorney General. No promises about the outcome, but he could at least apply to the Attorney General.The other statute seemed to suggest that he had to wait 10 years out of the country before he could seek relief.Now, I am not criticizing Congress’ handiwork here, okay? But those two statutes appeared a little in conflict. So the case came to our court in the first instance, and our court held that the first statute trumped, that the man had a right to apply for immediate discretionary relief and did not have to wait 10 years out of the country. And then some number of years later—I cannot remember whether it was 3 or 4, I want to say. Do not hold me to that. The Board of Immigration Appeals in its infinite wisdom comes back and says we are wrong. The Court of Appeals got it wrong; the 10year statute trumps.Okay. It says, though, that we are not just wrong, but we are wrong retroactively. So it is as if our decision never existed. And this man, who had relied on our holding to apply for immediate discretionary relief, was denied the opportunity to do so and told now he had to go start his 10-year waiting period.Now, instead of 10 years, it is now equivalent of, what, 13 or 14 years. And to me, that just seemed like he had the rug pulled out from underneath him. And I think a person in this country should be able to rely on the law as it is, and it is a matter of due process and fair notice. When he is told that is the law, he should be able to rely on it.And I also think it is a separation of powers question. When, with all respect, a bureaucracy can overrule neutral, dispassionate judges on the meaning of a law based on their political whims at the moment, that is a separation of powers issue, I think, and maybe an equal protection issue, too, because a political branch can single out people for disfavor. Judges are sworn to treat every person equally in that Vermont marble.

Yes, he—— 

Yes. 

Senator, we did apply the Chevron case faithfully because we had to, and I also wrote separately to ask questions, because I am a Circuit Judge. You know, I never dreamt I would be sitting here, I can tell you that, when I wrote this opinion. And part of my job as a Circuit Judge is to tee up questions for my bosses. And it struck me, here is a question. Is this resultconsistent with the Administrative Procedures Act? Which says in Section 706 that we are supposed to defer to agencies when it comes to questions of fact, to the scientists, to the biologists. But when it comes to questions of law, APA Section 706 entrusts courts to decide what the law is. And is this consistent with our values of equal protection, due process, and separation of powers?Those are questions I raised, Senator, to tee up for my bosses. 

I follow precedent. 

Well, we got to an outcome we could live with there, too, Senator, and applied Chevron. But I did raise it in the separate concurrence to raise these questions. You know, I do not know how I would rule if I were a Supreme Court Justice on the question. I have to be honest with you, Senator Cornyn, because I would want to do what a good judge does. Keep an open mind, read the briefs. And I could change my mind. I think here of my old boss, Dave Sentelle, who, when I clerked for him, he wrote a panel opinion going one way at the beginning of the year, and by the end of the year he wrote an en banc opinion, an opinion for the full court, reversing his own panel opinion. Now, some people say that is a man who does not have a spine, something like that. I say that is a judge with an open mind. 

Senator, I appreciate your thoughts, and it is a very difficult area doctrinally because you have two commands in the First Amendment that are relevant here. You have the Free Exercise Clause on the one hand, and you have the Establishment Clause on the other. So you are guaranteed free exercise of religion, and you are also guaranteed no establishment of religion. Those two commands are in tension because, to the extent we accommodate free expression, at some point the accommodation can be so great that someone is going to stand up and say you have established or you passed a law respecting the establishment of religion. It is a spectrum and it is a tension. And as in so many areas of law, judges have to mediate two competing and important values that our society holds dear.The Court has struggled in Establishment Clause jurisprudence to provide a consistent, comprehensive test. I think that is a fair statement. The current dominant test is called the ‘‘Lemon test,’’ and it asks whether the intent is to establish a religion, promote a religion, whether the effect is to help advance a religion, and whether there is too much entanglement between state and religion.It has proved a difficult test, according to six Justices at least who have expressed dissatisfaction with this test, but never at the same time.So Lemon endures, and academics have thoughts about various options and alternatives, I know, and the Justices themselves have expressed various and sundry ideas.I can tell you as a lower court judge just trying to faithfully do what the Supreme Court wants us to do, it is a bit of a challenge in this area. We struggle along.

Well, Senator, I hope it is not what he had for breakfast. And, you know, when I was a lawyer, all I wanted was a judge who put all of his personal things aside, her personalviews, and come to the law and the facts in each case fairly. And I do think when we are talking about interpreting the law, there is no better place to start than the text. Maybe here I have to blame Sister Mary Rose Margaret. She taught me how to read, and she taught me how to diagram a sentence. And it was under pain of the hot seat paddle, which hung above her desk for all to see.I used to say she could teach a monkey how to read. I think she did: Me. And I think that is where we want to start for a couple of reasons, with the text of the law.First, we go back to the due process considerations, the fair notice considerations we spoke of earlier. Before I put a person in prison, before I deny someone of their liberty or property, I want to be very sure that I can look them square in the eye and say, ‘‘You should have known. You were on notice that the law prohibited that which you are doing.’’ I do not want to have him say, ‘‘How am I supposed to tell?’’ I need an army of lawyers to figure that out. Some people can afford armies of lawyers. Most Americans cannot. It is a matter of fair notice and due process.The other part, again, is separation of powers considerations. If I start importing my feelings, if I treat statutes or laws as Rorschach inkblot tests, I have usurped your role. I have taken away the right of self-government by the people, for the people.I took a jog to the Lincoln Memorial the other morning before the start of all this. Second Inaugural address. There it is. Believe in government for the people, by the people. Maybe that is the—gosh, is that the——

It is the Gettysburg Address, isn’t it? I read them both. Thank you, Senator. It is the Gettysburg Address. It is the Gettysburg Address. 

No. I am sorry. It is just a matter of separation of powers. It is not my job to do your job. 

Right. And it is not a matter of strict construction. Strict construction in my mind sounds like I am putting the finger on the scale toward a particular interpretation, maybe even a pro-government interpretation. I do not see it that way at all. A judge should try and reach a fair interpretation, what a reasonable person could have understood the law to mean at the time of his actions. That is a pretty good starting place for fair notice and for separation of powers, I think, Senator. 

Thank you. 

I have not thought about that, Senator, to be honest with you. I know—— 

Senator, it is generally, as you know, on the facts the practice of an appellate court not to review or overturn the facts of a trial court except in the presence of clear error. 

And that is very—that is a very important standard. 

It may—I have not thought about it in separation of powers, but it is a very important principle that I take seriously. I was a trial lawyer for a long time. 

And I give you kind of a similar answer on that, Senator. I do not know about that, but I would say it is an important general practice. Sometimes there are exceptions that a court can and should go beyond a question presented, but it is pretty rare. Usually, we stick within—well, we do not—the questions presented are whatever the parties present to us on an intermediate court. They get to choose. We do not get to choose. 

Well, we generally refrain from examining arguments that have not been adequately developed or made for risk of improvident mistakes. 

In the loosest sense.

Senator, I—as I understand it, you may be referring to money that is not spent by a candidate or a party in connection with——

Okay. 

Sure. 

I have heard a lot about it, Senator, from you, from others. I have heard a lot about it. 

I know that there is a lot of money being spent in this by, as I understand it, both sides. I think it is—— 

Okay. I know what I have read; I know what I have heard from friends and family and acquaintances. I know what you are saying, what you have just indicated. 

There appears to be a lot of money being spent—— 

Senator, I could speculate based on what I have read and what I have heard, but I do not know individuals who are contributing. I do not know that. 

I do not know. 

Well, Senator, I think we have a long tradition from Buckley v. Valeo indicating that this body has robust authority to regulate disclosure. And—— 

Senator—— 

And, Senator, what I am prepared to say is I recognize that, as a matter of First Amendment interests, the Supreme Court has validated the proposition that disclosure serves important functions in a democracy. At the same time the Supreme Court has also acknowledged that those disclosure functions can sometimes themselves have unintended consequences, as with the NAACP case, which I know you are familiar with, where you can use disclosure as a weapon to try and silence people. And we have a long history in this——

Senator, I am not prejudging any case. What I am suggesting to you is that there are interests here in this area of First Amendment disclosure. That is what we are talking about——

In my mind generally, okay, that are competing. On the one hand in order for informed voters and citizens to be able to make decisions, the Supreme Court in Buckley has validated the interest that this body has in regulating disclosure. 

And in theory in Citizens United. At the same time, the Court has also recognized in NAACP, for example, that disclosure can be used as a weapon to silence voices. And we have a long history of anonymous speech serving valuable functions in this country—— 

A Publius. 

Senator, that is a policy question for this body. And this—— 

Senator—— 

It would be a politics question, and I am not, with all respect, Senator, going to get involved in politics. And if this body wishes to pass legislation, that is a political question for this body. And there is ample room for this body to pass disclosure laws for dark money or anything else it wishes to that can be tested in the courts. So, Senator, with all respect, the ball is in your court. 

Senator, I think every Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States is a remarkable person trying their level best to apply the law faithfully. I am just not——

Senator, it is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. There were thoughtful opinions by Justices on both sides.

Senator, what I mean to suggest is that I believe every Justice on the Court is trying to apply the First Amendment and the laws of this country faithfully. You may disagree with them. Many people do. I understand that. It is hard. Judges make half the people unhappy 100 percent of the time. That is our job description. And people do criticize judges. I understand your criticism.

But I do not question their motives, Senator. 

Senator, if a court errs as a matter of law, there are various remedies. There is a legislative remedy because there is always another law to be passed and another case to test. Every case comes on its own facts with its own record and can be analyzed anew. And then there is the law of precedent, which we have discussed, I wrote this 800-page book on, makes a great doorstop, gift for Christmas. I have a really bad deal on royalties. 

Yes, that is what I am suggesting. There is a way to do that, right? Precedent is not an inexorable command, and so the Court can reverse itself. It happens. 

Senator, I am not sure what the question for me is.

Senator, there is a lot about the confirmation process today that I regret, a lot.

A lot. When Byron White sat here, it was 90 minutes. He was through this body in 2 weeks, and he smoked cigarettes while he gave his testimony. There is a great deal about this process I regret. I regret putting my family through this. 

Senator, the fact of the matter is, it is what it is, and it is this body who makes the laws. And if you wish to have more disclosure, pass a law and a judge will enforce it, Senator. 

I would not count myself an expert, Senator. I—— 

Senator, a judge applying antitrust law looks to precedent predominantly for guidance as to what—— 

Yes. And so—— 

Well, Senator, respectfully, I disagree. A Supreme Court Justice is bound by precedent to. 

Senator, the precise question may be new but the notion that precedent would not bring to bear instructions and information on how it should be decided would be mistaken as well.

I would refer you again to Buckley v. Valeo and the NAACP.

And I am giving you my answer, Senator, as best I can—— 

Which is the First Amendment, which I am sworn to uphold as a judge. It contains two competing messages here. On the one hand, it has regularly recognized the rights of this body to legislate in this area if it wishes to do so. If it has not done so, with respect, that is not my fault. Okay. It is on legislators to legislate. And Buckley recognizes their authority. On the other hand, it is recognized there may be limits when it chills expression, as it did in the NAACP case. And we have to be worried about that because there is room in our democracy—— 

Senator, what I am saying—— 

Well, I am sorry, but I do not think this is simple stuff at all, Senator. I think this is hard stuff. And I think you have First Amendment concerns and precedents, all right, in the area—— 

That would have to be considered. We would have to see what law Congress enacted. I would then want to go through the full judicial process, Senator. I would want to read the briefs. I would want to keep an open mind. I would want to—— 

I said the Supreme Court of the United States in NAACP recognized that the First Amendment protections we all as people in this country enjoy—— 

Can be chilled sometimes. 

It is a First Amendment right we are talking about, Senator.

In the first instance, Senator, it is for this body to legislate——

And then it would come to court and the record will be made. 

It is a dialogue. It is a separation-of-powers dialogue that we have in all areas. Congress passes a law, a lawsuit is brought, a record is made, a factfinder makes facts, judges determine the law, a ruling is issued, Congress responds, and the cycle continues. And, Senator, that is our history in this area and so many others. Our founders were brilliant. They did not give me all the power. I do not wear a crown; I wear a robe. They did not give you all the power. They provided it—— 

I do. I would not claim him as my closest personal friend but someone whom I admire greatly. And it—— 

I would leave that for others to characterize. I do not like it when people characterize me, and I would not prefer to characterize him. He can characterize himself. 

You would have to ask them. 

Senator, I have no information about anything you have just described. I do not know about that.

Senator, to your earlier question, I think I can talk about my record. I am not a philosopher king, but I can talk about my record. And my record is that in the last 10 years I do not think there has been a single motion to recuse me. I have tried to be very careful in which cases I hear.

And—— 

I take that very seriously as part of my obligation as a judge. I cannot claim I am perfect but I have tried awful hard, and I have not had a motion filed against me because I do take seriously impartiality and the appearance of impartiality.

And, Senator, all I can say to you is I commit to maintaining my impartiality as best I can and to recuse where the law suggests I should. And—— 

Senator, there is a—— 

Corporate disclosure statement rule as I recall. 

Well, I think that is a very interesting suggestion and one I will take to heart, Senator. Obviously, this Congress has a role in rulemaking process as well, and there is a rulemaking Committee and a Rules Enabling Act process for the lower courts, and the Supreme Court has its own rulemaking process. And I appreciate that information for both functions—— 

And welcome your involvement. 

Senator, I know as a sitting judge I disclose every trip I take that is not official business that anybody else pays for. 

Thank you, Senator. I appreciate that acknowledgment. I do go to a lot of moot courts and things like that and, you know, and everything I have done is disclosed. So that is—it is all there, there. You have all the information.

Thank you. 

No, Senator. 

No, Senator. 

Goodness, no. 

I have served on my kids’ schoolboard—— 

But that is about as close to policy as I care to get. 

No, Senator. That is this body’s province.

Senator, I was not involved in the Citizens United case, and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that fact. I would also like to clarify that nobody speaks for me, nobody. I speak for me. I am a judge. I do not have spokesmen. I speak for myself. 

As your father knew well. It is one of the great joys of this job and one of the great surprises, right? You practice law for 20 years, you are used to working with pretty senior people, and then all of a sudden you show up, as I did my first day, and there is a pile of briefs waiting in a tiny office that has not been decorated, there is a chair, have at it. And you get to hire four brand-new young folks straight out of law school who do not know a darn thing. Have at it. Have fun. 

Well, you know, part of the reason why I am a judge is because of my experience as a law clerk, a shared experience with the same fellow your dad clerked for, Byron White, and we used to race writing opinions. And this is the humility of maybe the smartest lawyer I knew. I am talking about a Rhodes Scholar, first-in-his-class-from-Yale type stuff. And he would say first one done with the draft wins. What does it mean to win drafting an opinion? That was not real clear to me. But he was a pretty competitive guy, and what it meant was whoever got the first draft done, the other one went in the bin and we worked off the draft of the guy who won. I never won. And he could only type with these big paws—he had these big hands, thick, you know, pulling up sugar beets. And so he would hunt and peck and he could still beat me. It is a very close relationship. It is an intimate working relationship. And it becomes one of the great joys of your life. You see these young people—I have been out to pasture for 10 years. I thought I was done, you know. That was my life. I love my life. I love my home State. I hope I am making them proud.And you see these young people come and go and you get to see what they go on to do, and they go on to do such wonderful things. I have had young people who go on to clerk for the Supreme Court, about a dozen of them, for all kinds of Justices, Justices Scalia and Thomas, Justices Kennedy, Kagan, and Sotomayor. And that is a deep and inspiring thing.And you watch them go on beyond that, some of them are teaching, kids at Harvard, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame. Some people—a young lady who is doing fishery policy in South Africa, all sorts of really wonderful things, and it just gives you hope and heart for the future.You know, as I tell my students, somebody has to run the zoo, and you want it to be the best and the brightest. And it is so heartening to see these young people, some of whom are the first in their family to go to college, immigrants to this country, rise to the very top.

I always think that a family that skis together, stays together. We skied together.

That is a value judgment I am happy to make. 

Very vaguely. 

Quite a mouthful. 

It is, Senator. 

Sitting here, that is my recollection, too. 

Yes. That is my recollection, too. 

Senator, you try to treat each person as a person. We are all just people at the end of the day. And that equaljustice promise, the equal protection under law is the most radical guarantee I am aware of in the history of human law, a recognition that no one is better than anyone else. And, Senator, all I can tell you are some facts. These are the facts of my record. Ninety-seven percent of the time out of 2,700 cases, we have ruled unanimously. Ninety-nine percent of the time, I am in the majority. According to the Congressional Research Service, as I understand it, of the judges studied in the Tenth Circuit, my opinions attract the fewest dissents. They are not sure whether it is because I seek consensus or because I am persuasive. I do not care which it is. My law clerks tell me as well that I am as likely to dissent from a Democrat as a Republican-appointed colleague, not that that matters.

Senator, I know the men and women of the Tenth Circuit. I know the judges with whom I served. I question the motives of none, ever. We disagree sometimes, but when we disagree, it is about the law, not politics.And I think sometimes really in this country we are kind of like David Foster Wallace’s fish. He wrote about a fish swimming in an aquarium, and it spent so much time in water and is so surrounded by it that the fish does not even realize it is in water. And I feel like sometimes when we nitpick and we complain about the quality of justice in this country—which leaves a lot to be desired; there is much room for improvement. I am not here to say it is perfect or anywhere close to it. We are a work in progress. But the rule of law in this country is so profoundly good compared to anywhere else in the world that we can complain and know that we are protected because of the rule of law.I think we are a little bit like David Foster Wallace’s fish. We are surrounded by the rule of law. It is in the fabric of our lives so much so we kind of take it for granted.You know, just to go on, you know, my work on Access to Justice in the Rules Committee and outside the Rules Committee, speaking on it, I mean we are talking about overcriminalization, capital habeas. I have removed judges and lawyers when I have had to or sought their removal. I believe in our Seventh Amendment jury trial right. I have ruled for the least amongst us when it comes to immigrants—we have talked about a couple of examples—and criminal defendants.I can give you a whole long line of cases I can cite where I have ruled for Fourth Amendment claimants and other criminal defendants: Ford, Makkar, Farr, Games-Perez, Sabillon-Umana’s, Spaulding, Carloss, Ackerman, Krueger. That is just criminal that I have just jotted down here.Environmental cases: Rocky Flats, Magnesium in the renewable energy case. Civil rights you mentioned: Orr, W.D. Sports, K.C., Energy West, Crane, C.U. v. Simpson. Those are just some that come to mind.

Senator, I am not buying into any of that, with respect. With respect, I view my job to be fair. It is what General Katyal said to you all yesterday. What he wants is a fair judge. That rang true to me when I heard it. I did not know he was going to say that. That is exactly what I thought when I was a lawyer. I just wanted to go into court and have the judge hear my client, hear them, really hear them as a person on the facts and the law and leave everything else alone, at home where it belongs.And that is hard. I am not here to tell you it is easy and I am not here to tell you I am perfect, okay? I am a human being. I am not an algorithm. But I try really hard, and it is almost like an athlete. It is something judges practice. And hopefully, we get better at it with time.

Sitting here, that is my recollection. 

Yes, Senator. 

I thought so, Senator. That was my judgment in that case.

I do not believe so, Senator. 

Senator, your recollection is better than mine on the attorney’s-fees issue. 

Senator, that was another very hard case to go home after. The individual there had—was sick, very sick and had been given I think 6 months off I think already if I remember correctly. And I cannot remember whether it was University of Kansas or Kansas State. And then she was asking for another 6 months off and the university said no, and she sued under the Rehabilitation Act, which prescribes that reasonable accommodations must be provided to workers to perform their essential job functions. But to prevail, they have to show they can perform their essential job functions. And it was undisputed in that case she just could not through no fault of her own. And the District Court said that is just not a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, maybe for breach of contract, maybe something else, but not under Federal statutory law. That is my recollection sitting here. And my panel of three judges unanimously agreed that was the correct application of law in those facts. No one is here to say that—love the law in every case and the results it yields.I am here to say that I promise to apply the law faithfully, and I can guarantee you no more and promise you no less than that, Senator, in every case.

I do not recall. 

Judge Lucero is one of my dear friends and colleagues, and he was appointed by President Clinton. That is true. He did an excellent job. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, that is a very important question. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss it with you.I come to it with an open mind. It is not a question that, I confess, I have given a great deal of thought to. I have experienced more cameras in the last few weeks than I have in my whole lifetime by a long, long way. I have to admit, the lights in my eyes are a bit blinding sometimes, so I would have to get used to that.

Senator, I would treat it like I would any other case or controversy. That is what I can commit to you, that I would want to hear the arguments. I know there are Justices on both sides of this issue, right? 

Well, Senator, what I said is I disclosed every trip that is reportable. 

Yes. I know that the rules are different. I do not know how different they are. I have not studied that, Senator. 

Senator, I would say two things. First, I have no problem living under the rules I have lived under. I am quite comfortable with them. And I have had no problem reporting every year, to the best of my abilities, everything I can. So I can tell you that. It does not bother me what I have had to do. I consider it part of the price of service, and it is a reasonable and fair one. I would also say I do not know what the arguments are. I have not studied them, and I would want to commit to you that I would give it very fair consideration, and I would want to hear what my colleagues have to say. 

Of course I will. 

I pledge to you I will consider both of those things.

Senator, I think that is just another way, honestly, of trying to get at which Supreme Court precedents I agree with and I disagree with. 

Well, I think Senator Lee and I were just talking about a couple of cases where the results were not attractive to me as a person where I followed the law to the best of my abilities, and did so with my colleagues. 

Senator, Citizens United did overrule Austin. So in that respect, it is an example of a court that, in part, overruled a precedent, and that is part of the law of precedent too, as we have talked about, that you start with a strong presumption in favor of precedent. That is the anchor of the law. It is the starting point. But there are instances when a court may appropriately overrule precedent after considering a lot of factors, and we have talked about them, and I am happy to discuss them with you again if you would like, but I do not want to waste your time either, so you tell me. 

Senator, I welcome the opportunity to clarify Riddle v. Hickenlooper. In that case, the law in Colorado allowed individuals to contribute more money to major-party candidates than to minor-party candidates.

I am happy to try and explain again. So, the facts of the case, and that is what I was deciding, were uneven contribution limits. It was permissible to give more to major-party candidates than to minor-party candidates. And the law, as I know you are well aware, Senator, under Buckley, says the contribution to candidates is a First Amendment, fundamental right. It says that, and I was quoting Buckley, I am sure, or citing Buckley to that effect.And then the question becomes what level of scrutiny should we apply to that case? Buckley suggests that it is something less than strict scrutiny in the First Amendment context for contributions. That is the instruction that I as a lower court judge have in the First Amendment context. But this was an equal protection challenge, okay? Saying it is not just contributions. It is the inequality of contributions that is the problem here, that this system favors major-party candidates over minor-party candidates. And normally when we have a fundamental right in equal protection analysis, we apply strict scrutiny.So I was faced with a situation where do you take this little less than strict scrutiny out of the First Amendment context and import it into the equal protection context, or do you apply the normal strict scrutiny of the equal protection context? And I pointed to twoexcellent opinions by wonderful District Judges in the area, Judge Boasberg and Judge——

Can I answer you, Senator? 

Because I am almost there, okay? So I write to point out this conflict in the Supreme Court’s directions that I saw. 

All right? And then I said in our case, Byron White, it does not matter, because Colorado could not meet even a rational basis test. Forget about whether it is strict scrutiny or something close to strict scrutiny. It could not meet rational basis test because Colorado could not articulate any good reason, any— maybe there is one out there. I do not know. But I said they have articulated nothing. 

Okay. 

Goodness no, Senator. Hobby Lobby had nothing to do with the First Amendment of the Constitution. 

It was, under RFRA. 

I do not think Hobby Lobby speaks to the question of the First Amendment at all. What it speaks to is a question of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and what a person is, is defined under that statute by reference to the Dictionary Act, which is Congress’ direction to us, when we are dealing with statutes, what words we are supposed to use and what definitions are. And, Senator, if in RFRA, again, if this body wishes to say only natural persons enjoy RFRA rights, that is fine, and I will abide that direction. I am not here to make policy; I am here to follow it. 

Senator, all I can do is explain to you why I was concerned about Chevron in that case. And I was concerned because, again, we had an undocumented immigrant who was following judicial precedent——

Senator, I am trying to answer your question as best I can. And I was concerned about the due process implications that arise in cases like Mr. Gutierrez where an individual, who is not aided by an army of lawyers or lobbyists, can they anticipate changes in law by agencies back and forth, willy nilly, even to the point of overruling judicial precedent? And that is a due process concern I raised. I raised an equal protection concern about the ease with which individuals like Mr. Gutierrez can be singled out by the political branch in a way that judges are supposed to protect. I raised a separation of powers concern about whether judges should be the ones saying what the law is.

Goodness, Senator, yes.

Senator, my job as a Circuit Judge is when I see a problem, I tell my bosses about it, like any good employee. And my job there as I conceived it was to say, hey, listen, look at some of the implications, the real-world implications of what we are doing here.

Senator, I do not pre-judge it. I can tell you what did pre-exist it. It was Skidmore deference, which was an opinion written by Justice Jackson, actually. That is what pre-existed. So there was deference before, and we had the administrative state for 50 years, and agencies would issue rules and decisions. I do not know what all the consequences would be, and I would pledge to you—I was not thinking about being a Supreme Court Justice then. I was identifying an issue for my bosses.If I am so fortunate as to become a Justice, I would try and come at it with as open a mind as a man can muster. And I would tell you, remind you, what I bear in mind would be David Sentelle. When I was with him as a law clerk, he issued a panel opinion at the beginning of my year with him, going one way; and then by the end of the year wrote for the en banc court, the full court, reversing himself. Now, some people think that does not show a lack of sufficient steel. I think that shows an open mind and a lack of ego that a judge should bring to bear when he or she puts on the robe, and that is what I would commit to you.

Well, Senator, I would certainly agree that the Constitution must endure, and that it is a lot bigger than any of us, and it will live in that sense, hopefully, a very great deal longer than any of us, our children’s children.I do think it is important to try and understand law according to its original understanding, public meaning. Words have meaning.

No, Senator. 

I am trying to answer—— 

Well, I think it takes—these are complicated things that take more than a yes or no, respectfully. What I would say is the Constitution does not change. The world around us changes, and we have to understand the Constitution and apply it in light of our current circumstances. That is what we are trying to do as judges. So, for example, one of my favorite cases in this area is Jones, right? The Supreme Court of the United States is faced with a GPS tracking device attached by the police onto a car. Is that a search? And the Court goes back and looks, at the time of the founding, what qualified as a search, and found that would have qualified as a trespass to channels and a search by the Government, and says if that would have been offensive 200 years ago, that sort of thing, it has to be offensive now. The Constitution is no less protective of the people’s liberties now than it was 200 years ago. 

Senator, I am not looking to take us back to quill pens and horses and buggies. 

I am trying to. 

Of course women can be President of the United States. I am the father of two daughters, and I hope one of them turns out to be President of the United States. 

Senator, I think the generals in the Air Force can rest easy.

Let me give you another—— 

And the majority in that case argued that it was. 

And the majority said that the words ‘‘equal protection of the laws,’’ whatever the secret, harbored intentions of the writers, had an original public meaning that is quite radical and significant, and that was what the majority of the Supreme Court of the United States held. 

Senator, a good judge applies the law without respect to persons. That is part of my judicial oath. 

Senator, what I am trying to say to you is I do not take account of the person before me. Everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. 

Senator, if I might respond to that? 

I would ask you to take a look at Jones again; Kyllo, the search of a home using a heat-seeking device. I would ask you to maybe take a look at Crawford, the right to confront witnesses, maybe as well the Apprendi–Booker line written by Justice Stevens, a very originalist opinion about the right of an accused to be able to have all of the elements of an offense that increases his sentence tried by a jury of his peers. Those are all whatone might characterize as originalist opinions protecting individual liberties.

All right. 

Senator, I have not studied that, and it would be presumptuous of me to offer an opinion in a court that I have not sat upon. 

New York Times v. Sullivan was, as you say, a landmark decision, and it changed pretty dramatically the law of defamation and libel in this country. Rather than the common law of defamation and libel, applicable normally for a long time, the Supreme Court said the First Amendment has special meaning and protection when we are talking about the media, the press in covering public officials, public actions, and indicated that a higher standard of proof was required in any defamation or libel case. Proof of actual malice is required to state a claim. That has been the law of the land for, gosh, 50, 60 years. I could point you to a case in which I have applied it, and I think it might give you what you are looking for, Senator, in terms of comfort about how I apply it, Bustos v. A&E Network. It involved a prisoner who was concerned that he had been misrepresented as a member of the Aryan Brotherhood. He claimed he was not a Member, just a fellow traveler, and sought damages for that. Ourcourt declined to grant that relief, saying that substantial truth is protected even if it is not strictly true, and much more is required by the First Amendment in order to state a claim.

Senator, I know those cases come up from time to time, so I have to be very careful.

Your description of the case is entirely accurate. 

Thank you. 

Forty-two. 

Well, Senator, sometimes we have young people who come to court to be sworn in. Often, they are my law clerks. There are a couple of them right there. They have not enjoyed this privilege yet, and they come to court and they are very nervous. And the clerk tells us about their career and their record and submits them to the court. I move their admission to the bar. Are there any questions from the bench? And it is sort of like this. Itis a bit intimidating. This has been a reminder to me of what it is like to be down here rather than up there.And the last time I had this kind of interaction with Senator Lee, it was when he was down here and I was up there. Any rate, I sometimes ask them that question to put them at ease, and they all know the answer, and they all know the answer because they have all read Douglas Adams’ ‘‘Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.’’And if you have not read it, you should. It may be one of my daughters’ favorite books, and so that is a family joke.

You know, as I said, he really was my childhood hero. And to actually get picked out of the pile to spend a year with him, as Senator Lee’s dad did—that is something we share in common, too—was and remains the privilege of a lifetime. And it has everything to do with why I am here.I would not have become a judge, but for watching his example. And the humility with which he approached the job, and I do not mean a phony humility. I mean real humility, every day. He always said two heads were better than one.He would sit down in my office, plunk himself down in a chair across the desk. He would be talking about a case and say, ‘‘Ugh.’’ It always started with a grunt. I mean, that is how he started a conversation. It was like ‘‘hello’’—‘‘ugh.’’ ‘‘So what does the great Judge Gorsuch think about this one?’’And you were expected to have a view about pretty much anything and everything that he asked, and he would just sit there and chuckle at you. And he would laugh at you, and you were wondering what he thought. He never revealed his hand, and he would just walk out of the office. He would say, ‘‘Oh, that is what Judge Gorsuch thinks. Okay.’’And then he would go back, and he would think about it himself. And then he would come back in again, and just the whole thing would repeat itself as he was working through each case himself. He would want to bounce ideas off of this know-nothing 20-yearold, 20-something-year-old kid.And that, to me, taught me everything about what it means to be a judge and the fact that when asked his judicial philosophy in this sort of setting, he said it is to decide cases. And I know a lot of people think that is just mundane or maybe cover dishonesty in some way. It is just not true. It was the humility of the man.He knew that lawyers worked really hard because he had been a lawyer, a workaday lawyer for 14 years, I think it was, in a lawfirm. He tried cases—small cases, big cases—and he knew what it was like to have to be the lawyer in the well and how hard it is to have all the answers, how easy it is to ask the questions.

Yes. Well—— 

Yes. 

He would come up for a game of horse with the clerks, former law clerks at reunions. 

His best shot at that age, and we are talking in his seventies, late seventies, was from the free throw line back up over his head like that. And he could hit it pretty regularly. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. His eye-hand coordination was just uncanny. So I remember those, those law clerk reunions at the basketball court where he would come up and stiffly throw it up and sink it. I remember walking through with him in the basement, arm in arm, liked to walk arm in arm at that age, and we walked past all the portraits of all the former Supreme Court Justices, which are down at ground level. And he would ask me, ‘‘Ugh,’’ grunt, ‘‘how many of these guys do you honestly recognize?’’ And I was one of those pencil-necked law clerks, and the truth was I thought I knew a lot about the Supreme Court, the law, and the answer was about half, the honest answer. And he said, ‘‘Me, too.’’ And he said, ‘‘The truth is we will all be forgotten soon enough, me included.’’ And I remember saying, ‘‘Justice, that is impossible. You are one of the greats. No way you are going to be forgotten.’’ His portrait now hangs down in the basement. 

Senator, I want to say a few things about that, and I appreciate the opportunity. The first is that sometimes we, in our discourse today, our civil discourse, use labels as a way to not engage with other people, to treat and divide us and them.And as a judge, I just do not think that is a very fair or appropriate or useful way to engage in discourse. So I am worried about using labels in ways that are sometimes an excuse for engagement with the ideas, sometimes pejoratively.The truth is I do not think there is a judge alive who does not want to know about whatever legal text he or she is charged with interpreting something about its original meaning, as enacted. And I do not think this is an ideological thing. I look at decisions like Jones, which we have talked about, or decisions like Kyllo, the thermal imaging of a home. Is that a search under the Fourth Amendment?The Supreme Court goes back and looks at the original history and says it is equivalent to Peeping Toms, which, of course, would be a search under the Fourth Amendment. The Constitution is no less protective today of the people’s liberties than it was 200 years ago.Or when we look at Crawford and the right to confront witnesses and not just have pieces of paper flying in evidence that you cannot confront reasonably. To cross-examine your opponent, fundamental right of the Sixth Amendment. Look back to the original understanding. That informs us.Or in the Fifth Amendment, Justice Stevens in Apprendi wrote a very fine examination of the original history of the Constitution and said it is not right that an individual should be sentenced to prison and then hand sentence on the basis of facts a jury has not found. Those are all originalist, if you want to put that label on it, opinions. Every one of them.You could look at Powell v. McCormack about the qualifications of Members of Congress. That was written by Chief Justice Warren. It is a very careful—you might agree or disagree with it, but it is a very careful examination of the original history and understanding of the relevant provisions of the Constitution.Or Heller, Second Amendment case. Justice Scalia and Justice Stevens both, majority and dissent, wrote opinions that are profoundly thoughtful in examining the original history of the Constitution. I guess I am with so many other people who have come before me, Justice Story, Justice Black, and yes, Justice Kagan, who, sitting at this table, said we are all originalists in this sense, and I believe we are.

Right. 

Well, it is just these discussions we have been having, right? You go back and you look to the evidence of what it was understood at the time to protect. Of course, Madison did not know about thermal imaging or GPS tracking devices or DNA or email. And no one is looking to take us back to the horse and buggy day or quill pens or to turn back the clock on anything. The point is to apply the law in a way that allows us to be able to say as judges it is not what we wish. It is what the law was understood to mean. It has a fixed meaning, as Madison said, in the fixed meaning canon of construction. That the Constitution should have a fixed meaning, all right? And the judges may disagree over what that is. We disagree once in a while. Not as often as some would like to portray, once in a while. But our disagreements are not political disagreements. They are disagreements over what the law is. That has been very important to me. And the other thing it does is it is a due process value. We are interpreting the law in a way that we can charge people with notice of because we are judging them for their past conduct. People lose their liberty, their property on the basis of our interpretations of the law. That seems to me that it should only be fair that there are interpretations we can charge them with notice of, right? Similar thing when we come to statutory interpretation, right? What does that text mean? What could a reasonable reader understand that text to mean? You know, my favorite case in statutory interpretation when I teach this stuff and talk to my law clerks about it is the fish case. There the statute read something like, I am not going to get it exactly right, but if you destroy email documents or other tangible objects when you know the cops are after you, you go to jail. Well, what does that mean in the context of a fisherman who knows that the Coast Guard is after him, and he has an illegal catch and he throws it overboard? That case went to the U.S. Su-preme Court. It is a great case. And it divided in a way that people do not expect, right?Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion and along with Justice Alito writing a concurrence, saying fish? This statute is about email. Nah, no, no. Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia wrote a dissent, saying fish? That is a tangible object, right? He had notice. He should not have done it.And so these things do not divide along any kind of ordinary ideological line. I am confident that there are Justices who in that case or in Heller or in any of these cases would, as a matter of policy, have come out differently than they did as in a matter of judging. And that, to me, is all the difference in the world. We are not doing what we would like, but what we think the law is.

Yes, I think it is fun to go into audiences and challenge them sometimes a bit. I think it is important. And as to the Federalist Society, I do not have a card either, and I really do not want a back statement for past dues. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. But I attend maybe one event a year or something like that. It is all alumni forums that you all have. And at that speech, I did talk to the society about the problem of overcriminalization as I saw it. On the Federal statutory books today, we have approximately 5,000 criminal laws. That does not count, of course, all the criminal laws at the State and local level, and Congress pours out a lot of new criminal laws all the time. Most of those laws are of relatively recent vintage. I asked my law clerks to go find out, okay, now how many of those—how many laws do we have that have criminal penalties that are in regulations, too, right? Just out of curiosity. And I thought they’d be able to come back with a number.And apparently—they reported back, and I trust them. They are pretty smart. They came back and said that scholars have given up trying to count the number. They gave up at around 300,000.And Madison warned, you know, he lived in a time when there were too few written laws, so that the king could pretty much do as he wished. Tyrannical king. That is the experience they had. But he foresaw a world and warned about a world in which we have too many laws to the point where the people cannot know what the law is.And of course, there is the great example of Caligula, right, who posted laws, ancient Roman emperor, deliberately posted laws written in a hand so small and up so high that nobody could tell what the law was. Better to keep the people on their toes. Sorry.And that is a problem, too, right, for due process, fair notice. And the truth is in like so much else in life, we are aiming for the golden mean. Not too much, not too little. A point where people have enough fair notice, but are not overwhelmed. That is what I spoke about.

Oh, goodness. That was the whole point of this speech, Senator.

And there is a counterpart to the Federalist Society now, the American Constitutional Society. One of my friends who was just here is on the board. It does similar good work.

I think these societies, debating societies, useful to ideas percolating, being shared in a civic way, in a way that we can discuss with one another calmly, coolly, thoughtfully. Not yelling at one another, not using labels to dismiss one another. That is what I get out of it. I learn things. 

No, Senator. 

I think these are long-settled precedents we are talking about. 

I believe it is. 

Well, Senator, I get law clerks from all over the country, many from my region. I maybe favor my region, but I get plenty from out of the area, too. And we have a great rodeo in Denver every year, the Grand National, and it begins with a parade down 17th Street, which would be like a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in DC, where you have cattle, it is a cattle drive down the main road in Denver. They shut it down. That is how you mark the opening of the Grand National. And the closing of the Grand National is celebrated by the prize steer getting to spend a little time in the Brown Palace Hotel. Nowthe Brown Palace Hotel is like the Willard or pick your favorite fancy, at the Plaza in New York. Yes, they bring the prize steer into the lobby of the Brown Palace.And in between, there is a rodeo and the stock show, and the kids show their animals. My kids never made it to the Grand National. They are more county fair types with their chickens and their rabbits and dogs and whatever. But the kids compete to the Grand National, this Grand National. This is big time.And then there is mutton busting, and I think my children still have PTSD from mutton busting.[Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. Mutton busting, as you know, comes sort of like bronco busting for adults. You take a poor little kid. You find a sheep—— [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. And you attach the one to the other and see how long they can hold on. And you know, it usually works fine when the sheep has a lot of wool, and you tell them to hold on— I tell my kids hold on monkey-style, you know, really get in there, right, get around it. Because if you sit upright, you go flying right off, right? So you want to get in. But the problem when you get in is that you are so locked in that you do not want to let go, right? And so then the poor clown has to come and knock you off the sheep. And my daughters, you know, they got knocked around pretty good over the years. 

Well, I am sorry. We could talk mutton busting all day. 

You sound like my daughters on that score, Senator. 

Senator—— 

Would I want to be on the—— 

Would I want to be on the road with him? 

With the hitched trailer or the unhitched trailer, Senator? 

No. I do not think that was a serious option. I agree with you. 

Yes. An unhitched trailer—— 

Right. 

And then I believe he comes back 15 minutes later. 

Right. 

Oh, Senator, I do not know what I would have done if I were in his shoes, and I do not blame him at all for a moment for doing what he did do. 

I empathize with him entirely. 

Oh, Senator, I thought a lot about this case because I—— 

I totally empathize and understand—— 

Senator, I do not know. I was not in the man’s shoes, but I understand why he did—— 

Yes. I understand—— 

That is the gist of it. 

Well, Senator, there are a lot more words in the opinions, both in the majority by my colleagues and in dissent, but that—I am happy to agree with you that is the gist of it. 

That is what was argued to us by both sides, Senator. 

Yes, both sides argued that the plain meaning supported their—— 

But both sides did. 

Senator, a couple of things in response to that, if I might? Going back, the absurdity doctrine argument was never presented to the Court, and it usually applies in cases where there is a scrivener’s error, not when we just disagree with the policy of the statute. So I appreciate the opportunity to respond there.

Scrivener’s error. 

Error, yes. 

Not when we just disagree with the policy. With respect to campaigns—— 

Oh, yes. 

Senator, my heart goes out to him. 

My heart goes out to him, but it is just not my job to write—— 

And Senator, since I became a judge 10 years ago, I have a canon of ethics that precludes me from getting involved in any way, shape, or form in politics. They are the reason why judges do not clap at the State of the Union and why I cannot even attend a political caucus in my home State to register a vote in the equivalent of a primary. 

Senator, I appreciate the invitation, but I know the other side has their views of this, and you, your side has your views of it. That, by definition, is politics.

And Senator, judges have to stay outside of politics. I think the world of Merrick Garland. I think he is an outstanding judge. 

I have told you what I think about him. 

1976, I was walking the district with my mom. 

When she was running for State house. 

Senator, I do not recall any involvement in that issue during that campaign. I remember going to Ohio—— 

Oh, certainly, I was aware of it. 

Well, Senator, my personal views? Any revelation of my personal views about this matter would indicate to peo-ple how I might rule as a judge, mistakenly, but it might. And I have to be concerned about that.

Senator, my personal views, if I were to begin speaking about my personal views on this subject, which every American has views on, would send a misleading signal to the American people that my——

It is absolutely settled law. There is ongoing litigation about its impact and its application right now, and I cannot begin to share my personal views without suggesting mistakenly to people—— 

Well, if I might finish? 

Senator, it is to be a judge, to be fair, to follow the law. To apply it to the facts and circumstances of each case and to live out my judicial oath on whichever court I serve on, whether it is the Tenth Circuit, where I have served for the last 10 years——

And where my opinions have been unanimous 97 percent of the time, Senator. 

I have been in the majority—— 

Respectfully, Senator, Mr. Priebus does not speak for me, and I do not speak for him. I do not appreciate when people characterize me, as I am sure you do not appreciate it when people characterize you. I like to speak for myself. I am a judge. I am my own man. 

Senator, there is a lot about this process I am uncomfortable with, a lot. But I am not God. No one asked me to fix it. I am here as a witness, trying to faithfully answer your questions as best I can, consistent with the constraints I have as a sitting judge. Here to answer questions about my qualifications and my record.

Senator, respectfully, I believe that is a question best directed to Mr. Bannon.

Senator, I am a Circuit Judge. I do not tell my bosses what to do. I do, when I see a problem, raise my hand and tell my bosses I see an issue here. And I did in that case not because of any big corporate interest, but because of what happened to Mr. Gutierrez, an undocumented immigrant to this country.And the whipsaw that he was placed in by a change in law affected by an administrative agency, a bureaucracy, overruling a judicial precedent and telling him he now had to wait not 10 years out of the country, but 14, something like that.And Senator, that is part of my job to say these things when I see problems like that. It is a due process problem I saw, and no one, Senator, is suggesting that scientists should not get deference, or chemists or biologists. Section 706 of the APA is quite clear that on facts——

Boy, I do not even know what to say now. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. You really caught me off guard there, Senator Sasse.

My daughters are 17 and 15. 

Oh, my goodness, yes. 

No, but I think some of my buddies have. [Laughter.] 

No, it would not have helped any. My kids were pretty rotten at basketball. 

Senator, that is a question I ask my kids every semester when I teach ethics, finish the semester with asking them to spend 5 minutes writing their obituary. They hate it. They think it is corny, and it might be a little corny. And then I ask them if they will volunteer to read some of them, and people want to be remembered for the kindnesses they showed other people by and large.And what I point out to them—what I try to point out is it is not how big your bank account balance is. Nobody ever puts that in their draft obituary, or that they billed the most hours, or that they won the most cases. It is how they treated other people along the way.And for me, it is the words I read yesterday from Increase Sumner’s tombstone. And that means as a person I would like to be remembered as a good dad, a good husband, kind and mild in private life, dignified and firm in public life. And I have no illusions that I will be remembered for very long, none, if Byron White is nearly forgotten, as he is now as he said he would be. I have no illusions I will not last 5 minutes. That is as it should be.‘‘The great joy in life,’’ Shaw said, ‘‘is devoting yourself to a cause you deem mighty before you are thrown on the scrapheap.’’ An independent judiciary in this country, I can carry that baton for as long as I can carry it, and I have no illusions I am going to last as long as you suggest. And that will be good enough for me.

Senator, I admire them both, and I think it is a wonderful fact they were both here to introduce me, and that they follow a tradition, the West, where Senator Salazar and Senator Allard, Republican, Democrat, introduced me last time around. And, frankly, 10 Circuit nominations, thanks to—he is not here at the moment—but Senator Hatch cares about the Tenth Circuit, Republican and Democrat, generally going very smoothly.And it shows. It shows that you all have picked—I do not know how it works. I do not know how this crazy process works, but the colleagues you have selected for me over the years are wonderful colleagues, wonderful people. And I have been richly blessed to spend 10 years with every one of them.

I suspect, but I do not know because I have not sat where you sit. I would not presume to be able to walk in your shoes. But I presume gingerly that you will look back on your career and say I accomplished this piece of legislation or that piece of legislation and changed the lives of the American people dramatically as a result.I was fortunate enough to serve as a page in this body many years ago. It is an experience every young person should have. It will give them a lifelong love of this body. It the greatest deliberative body in the world. I believe that even sitting here.A judge looking back, the most you can hope for is you have done fairness to each person who has come before you, decide their case on the facts and the law, and that you have just carried on the tradition of a neutral, impartial judiciary that each person can come to with some sense that they are going to receive a fair hearing for their disputes. That is what we do. We just resolve cases and controversies. And lawyers are supposed to be fierce advocates, and I was once a fierce advocate for my clients. But a judge is supposed to rule impartially, to listen courteously, and rule impartially.So, frankly, my legacy should look and will look a lot smaller than yours, and that is the way the design of the Constitution works.

Goodness no, Senator. 

I was a private attorney. 

Justice Jackson says, ‘‘A robe changes a man or it should.’’ Now, I am sure you would add ‘‘woman’’ today, too. A psychological change comes over that person. He was the fiercest possible Advocate Attorney General for FDR, and he wrote a dissent, as we have talked about earlier, in Korematsu. He wrote the Steel Seizure concurrence. He was a brave man. That is a judge’s judge, calling it like he sees it in each case as it comes, and writing clearly so that people can understand exactly what he is up to, and he is not hiding behind jargon, legalese, or four million footnotes. That is the best I can do on that. 

I am with Justice Kagan on this. I think it is what we all want to know. I do not know a judge who would not want to know what the original understanding is of a particular term in the Constitution or a statute. That is information that would be valuable to any judge and considered by a judge. Again, in Heller, for example, Second Amendment case, deeply thoughtful opinions by both sides on that question. It does not necessarily decide the case, but it provides us a language to talk to one another in which we are trying to seek something outside of ourselves, outside of our own personal beliefs, about what the Constitution or the statute at hand means. We are trying to do it in a way that is neutral and that we can say provides fair notice to those whose lives we are affecting, so that we are interpreting the law in a way that we can say they should have known. They were on notice. We are not putting a person in prison willy nilly based on our preferences. We are taking away their liberty, but we are preserving it in accordance with the Constitution as it was written. 

Senator, as a judge on the Tenth Circuit, I have tried hard to do that, literally teaching class, speaking where I am invited when I am invited, going to law schools, talking to students, and visit the courthouse, and it has been a great privilege and a joy.I think here of Justice O’Connor—Sandra Day O’Connor—and when she retired she did an awful lot of this. She has done an amazing amount of work. And I do think that there is a need to remind people how to talk to one another, how we talk to one another, and more fundamentally about how brilliant the design of this Constitution is. Not perfect, but e pluribus unum. From many, one.And we are all not Republican judges, Democratic judges. We are judges, and I think we do have an opportunity, and that is one of the things I look forward to as a Justice. My little talks might be a little better attended on civics, and I hope to do that.Maybe that is a Western thing, I do not know, or a MidWestern thing, Senator. But I really believe in this country, and I am opti-mistic about its future. I see the young people. I teach them. I get law clerks that really care about this country, and they give me hope every day.Senator Coons and I share the distinction of being Truman Scholars, and we go through the selection process of picking the next crop every year. Harry Truman did not want a monument as a memorial here in Washington. Think about that, the humility of that. Instead, he wanted a living monument, a scholarship to young people who go on to do public service.Well, you got two of them here. And every year when I go do that selection process, I do not know about Senator Coons, but it is one of the best days of the year for me because I see young people full of enthusiasm for this country and anxious to make it better.I look forward to working, if I am so fortunate to be confirmed, on just this topic, Senator, with you, with Senator Coons, and anyone else.

When I sit down to write an opinion, people sometimes ask me who I am writing for. I am writing for myself. I am trying to convince myself that I have it right. And I go through a lot of drafts, and I sometimes, as my law clerks know, change tack as I am—I am drafting. I do not know how many drafts I have gone through on some opinions, 30? More.

Because I am trying to get it right, and I find I test ideas as I write. It is one thing to say to somebody else, oh, go write this up. It is another thing to have to sit down and write it yourself. And it exposes holes and gaps in your own thinking, causes you to question yourself, wonder whether you have it right. So for me, it is an exercise of getting it right, and persuading myself at the end of the day, and writing in a language that persuades me. A lot of gobbledygook, and us lawyers are guilty of a lot of gobbledygook, that does not persuade me. I want to know through a clear line. I want to be able to see my argument or my topic sentences. And maybe it is Sister Rose Margaret, I do not know, but I want to see the argument flow. I want to see how it fits together, and then I want it torn apart by my law clerks who tell me I am wrong. So, it is an iterative process because at the end of the day, that is what it is all about. And then it is about the test of my colleagues, and I take their comments very seriously. I believe in collegiality. I believe that two heads, three heads, nine heads are better than one. And so, I think a good judge cannot have too much pride of authorship. He has to accept criticism, constructive criticism, and try and incorporate or deal with that criticism. Maybe that is why myopinions have attracted relatively few dissents, I do not know, but I take collegiality very seriously.As to writing separate opinions, I do not do it very often, and when I do it, it is usually because I am just stuck. I might be wrong, but I am just stuck. Something does not seem right to me, and I have tried to discuss it with my colleagues, I have tried to work it out. I have bent as far as I can bend, but at the end of the day I have—I take the oath to follow the law where it leads me.And I try hard to reach a collegial consensus, but when I cannot, I write up what I can as respectfully as I can, and usually in as few words as I can, a dissent or a separate concurrence. Sometimes because it is back bound, but it is just where I am stuck. Sometimes it is because I see an issue that my bosses need to be aware of, like any good employee. Hey, boss, you might want to think about this one, it seems kind of tough to me. And I think that is part of the process of a good judge.

Yes. 

I think if you are sitting and writing your dissertation for yourself with a picture of your aunt, you are right on target, because I think if I am writing for myself and trying to persuade myself, then I figure everybody will be able to at least track what I did. Maybe not agree with every opinion, every single one of the 2,700 decisions I have issued, but they will understand why I have where I have. I was candid about it. I did not hide. I stood up. I was clear. I was honest. I was forthright, plain-spoken. And you can judge my opinions for better or worse on their merits. And I think that is what a good judge does is candor, the duty of candor. 

That is a big question. For us adults—— 

Yes, I have 4 minutes and 19 seconds on that. That is a big question for us adults who are where we are. It is a big question for my middle school- and high school-age kids. The Constitution as a negative document, the theory behind it, in short order, was to divide liberty—to divide power the better to protect liberty. That is the theory, that if you put all power in one set of hands, are going to get tyranny. And our Founders had too much evidence of that in their own time. It is kind of a hard-won inheritance, part Enlightenment theory, right, part on the battlefield. They saw what it was like to have power amalgamated in one set of hands, dangerous, so they divided it. They divided it three ways on our—in our Federal system. You, Article I, write the laws, and it is tough. It is supposed to be tough to protect liberty. We do not just have one house. We have two houses. And then, it has to be signed by the President, too. Really hard. Bicameralism and presentment is designed to make legislation difficult the better to protect liberty. The President’s powers are to execute the laws, not make them, not adjudicate disputes. Our role is to decide cases and controversies between the people under law as it is, not as we would wish it to be. We are not legislators. We are judges. The legislative power is invested in this body. That is not all. Then we divide power in a way that was quite unique—well, unusual: Federalism. So, you can think of separation of powers as having a horizontal axis and a vertical axis so that the Federal Government has certain enumerated powers and authorities. And what the Federal Government does not enjoy, the States do as sovereigns. This country as well, we have Tribes which also bear sovereignty in our part of the world, and bear recognition as such. And I am glad to have the opportunity to recognize that fact here as a Westerner. So, we have the separation of powers between horizontally, vertically. And that was not thought enough to protect liberty. The drafters of the Constitution, many of them thought that would be more than sufficient, that, in fact, was the main way to preserve liberty. But our Founders were very suspicious and very jealous of their liberties, so they added the Bill of Rights, and they enumerated 10 of them, as you know, starting with freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, no establishment of religion, right to bear arms. The Third Amendment, which I am glad we do not litigate much. I wonder how many of the high school kids now watching know what the Third Amendment is about. Go look it up. [Laughter.] 

So, that is what the Bill of Rights is about—it is ensuring not just these negative protections, but some positive, affirmative guarantees against governmental encroachment.

Hi, Senator. Good to see you. 

So, under the Religious Freedom—Senator, thank you. Interesting, good question. I mean, this is—this is—this is what it is all about. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects this exercise of sincerely held religious beliefs, and affords them the highest protection known in American law, strict scrutiny. That is a law that this Congress passed because it was not satisfied with the degree of protection that the Supreme Court was affording the exercise of religious liberty under the First Amendment under Smith.This Congress found Smith, written by Justice Scalia, to be insufficiently protective of the right to free exercise.

Yes. 

Thank you for prodding me along. The point is, what is a sincerely held religious belief? The individuals there were devout Christians, and as they interpreted their religion, it was a violation, a sin, for them to participate in any way in signing papers even to allow the provision of certain contraceptive devices, those that they believed had the effect of destroying a fertilized egg. 

They were okay—— 

Yes. 

Sure. 

Right. 

Senator, it is not a new concept at all, with respect, because in enacting RFRA, Congress revived some older free exercise case law—— 

Much of it written by Justice Brennan. Thomas would be a leading example involving, I believe it was a Jehovah’s Witness. 

Okay, who was okay in producing certain goods that could be used as armaments, but not others. 

Complicity in war making was a matter of faith that—— 

Right. 

Senator, respectfully I think we are mixing apples and oranges because the first consideration is whether we have a substantial burden on a sincerely held religious belief. The second is whether the Government has a compelling interest, narrowly tailored, to override it. And I think we are mixing apples and oranges because on the first one, complicity is very much in play, and it is the same in Thomas as it is with the Greens. How far does my religious faith, your religious faith permit us to engage in things that our religion teaches are wrong, sinful? That is a matter of religious faith. And, in fact, I do not recall anyone doubting or the Government disputing that the Greens’ religious faith was sincerely held on that score. 

So, I think it is a given. So, this complicity discussion I think, frankly, Senator, is a red herring, to mix my metaphors, because everyone accepted it. 

I know I am mixing—I know it is terrible. I would not want to write it down in an opinion. It is terrible. 

I would be delighted to, Senator, and thank you for the opportunity. I think I would point to a couple of things. First, RFRA is a statute, and it uses the term ‘‘person,’’ and it does not define the term ‘‘person.’’ And when Congress does not offer us a specific definition, we go to the Dictionary Act, which Congress has passed for just these circumstances.And there it says persons include corporations. That is the law as Congress wrote it and if Congress wishes to change the law and say only natural persons enjoy the rights of RFRA, I am a judge. I follow the law. But the law as drafted does not distinguish between natural persons and corporations. It includes them both.And the Government, Senator, if I might just finish, conceded, as I recall—and my recollection may or may not be great on this, but as I recall conceded that nonprofit corporations can exercise religion.

Right. 

Senator, I offer you two thoughts on that. First, as I recall sitting here, and I have to go study my books, but the Supreme Court in an earlier First Amendment case did recognize a challenge by an Orthodox Jewish shopkeeper to Sunday closing laws.

That was a corporation, for-profit. So, respectfully, I am not sure it is accurate to say there is no precedent for it. Second, I would say to you the position you are advocating is a fine position, respectable position. It is a good position. It was adopted by precisely two Justices of the Supreme Court, and only two. 

Senator, respectfully, I do not believe that is accurate either because all the Court held was that the Government had to come up with another alternative to provide the contraceptive care it wished to provide. The Court acknowledged—the Supreme Court acknowledged that there was a compelling interest in providing the contraceptive care, and simply said that an accommodation could be reached that did not involve the Greens or require them to give up their sincerely held religious beliefs, much as had been done for churches—— 

And hospitals, and lots of other entities. And the Government could not explain why it could not accommodate other entities, like Hobby Lobby, as well or Little Sisters of the Poor. 

Senator, I think it was just a matter of what had been—what the record was in that particular case before us. 

Correct. 

No, Senator, not necessarily. It does not mean that at all. All it means is the Government under the law, as passed by this Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support at the time——

I am sorry; speaking of RFRA. 

Oh, and the ACA, you can override RFRA any time you want. Congress could say RFRA does not apply to the ACA. That is another alternative. You can abandon RFRA. You can say it does not apply to this particular statute. You can say it applies only to natural persons. You can say it does not apply to contraceptive care. Congress controls this decision, Senator. 

It is your decision. It is not mine, with all respect. We are just trying to implement what you have asked us to do. 

And, Senator, on your hypotheticals, okay? 

Justice Brennan wrote these First Amendment cases that you are seeking to revive, I would remind you that, all right? 

Justice Brennan, all right? And the fact of the matter is sometimes the Government can prove a compelling interest, and then it has the most narrowly tailored way to get there, and sometimes it cannot. And each case has to be taken on its facts in the particular context in which it arises. 

Senator, it would—it would go back—we would do the analysis. 

The same analysis. Do they have a sincerely held religious belief? Sometimes people do not. I have had claims, for example, of individuals——

It depends. 

Well, Senator—— 

Senator, I think it depends on the facts of the case. So, for example, I have had a case where a number of people came before us and said we have a sincerely held religious belief that marijuana is God. 

It turned out it was a drug distribution ring, all right? 

And what they really worshipped was the almighty dollar. 

Well. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. And they were really just trying to make a buck, okay? And the District Court found that was not a sincerely held religious belief. So, you can get off the train there. That is one place where you may get off the train in your hypothetical. You have another place to get off the train. It is substantial burden. 

Another place is compelling interest by the Government. Another place is narrowly tailoring. So, there are four steps in the process, and you have to go through all four of them as a good judge with the facts of each case as it comes. And, Senator, again, it is all statutory. You could abolish it tomorrow. 

Right. 

I think Lee would be the sort of law you look at when you are applying RFRA, absolutely. 

Yes. 

The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, exactly. So, that is a very good example, Senator, of where the Government was able to prove compelling interest in their own tailoring, yes.

Yes. 

No, Senator. Again, I think we are mixing our apples and oranges because the Government in the ACA was spotted the compelling interest. The problem was the narrow tailoring. You could get there without forcing the Greens to do something their religion prohibited. So, it was not like the system of Social Security, which depends upon everyone’s participation. That was the distinction the Supreme Court drew. 

Under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, it is a four-part test effectively. 

All right? And for every challenge, you ask those questions. Is there a sincerely held religious belief? Is there a substantial burden on it? If check, check, then you go to the Government side of the ledger. Do they have a compelling interest, and is it narrowly tailored? And that is the law you have set forth, Senator, because this body did not like, frankly, Justice Scalia’s decision in Smith. And if this court—sorry—if this—the old trial lawyer in me. Sorry, getting tired. If this Congress wishes to say Justice Scalia was right in Smith and we have changed our minds, that is entirely up to this Congress. 

I recommend it.

Senator, respectfully, I am not sure I would agree with your characterization.

Of the book. I agree with your characterization of being a Westerner. The book does conclude that Cruzan is absolutely correct, that there is a right to be left alone at the end of life. These are hard decisions. I do not pretend to have any perfect answers here. I was writing this book as my dissertation, trying to contribute to what I thought was a very hard question, and I still think a very hard question, one we all have had personal struggles with, Senator, as I know you have and I have. And this is a human problem. We are mortal. Cruzan held that people have a right to be left alone presumptively under the common law, presumptively constitutionally, to stop care, go home, die in your own bed, as a lot of my family Members have done. The question is whether you should also have an additional right to have someone kill you, involve doctors in killing. And there are good arguments on both sides of that ledger, as I explore in the book. And—— 

Sure. 

Yes, Senator, I do. Privacy is in a variety of places in the Constitution. The first and most obvious place, back to the Bill of Rights, is the Fourth Amendment, the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures in your homes, papers, and effects. That is privacy, right? The Third Amendment, which I alluded to, but did not want to reveal.

No quartering of troops. Stay out of my house with your troops. Now, happily we do not litigate that much, all right? The First Amendment, the right to free expression, which we have been talking about, the freedom of religious belief and expression, that requires a place of privacy. And the Fourteenth Amendment, Senator, over now about 80 or 90 years, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that the liberty prong of the due process clause protects privacy in a variety of ways having to do with child-rearing and family decisions, going back to Meyer, which involved parents who wished to have the freedom to teach their children German at a time it was unpopular in this country, and Pierce, the right of parents to send their children to a parochial school if they wish. So, Senator, yes, the Constitution definitely contains privacy rights. 

Senator, I was speaking as a commentator before I became a judge, not expressing views as a judge, all right? My views as a commentator I am happy to talk about, though. I found this a very difficult question. The Supreme Court has held that this is an issue for the States to decide under Glucksberg and Quill, for the people to decide on the State level. I agree with those decisions. I say so in the book. My concern about legalization that I express in the book as a commentator has to do with the equal protection principles we have been talking about today, the equal justice under law principles. And I am concerned—in the book I expressed concerns as a commentator about what legalization might mean for the least amongst us, the most vulnerable, the disabled, the elderly who might be pressured into accepting an early death because it is a cheaper option than more expensive hospice care, things like that, that might cost more. And so, that was a concern I expressed. Senator, I do not pretend, though, to have the last word on that or to know the right answer. I was contributing as a commentator to what I thought was a very hard discussion. 

Yes. 

Well, I was an Advocate for the Government at the time, Senator. That is my job, all right? When you represent the Government, you want the Government to win. When you represent somebody against the Government, you want the Government to lose. And as a judge, Senator, it is a very different mindset. 

Sure. 

Senator, the Supreme Court in Glucksberg, the majority held that this issue is for the States to decide and the people to decide. The people of Oregon have made their decision to legalize it, for example. It was just legalized in November in my home State of Colorado. That is their right. 

Senator, my personal views have nothing to do with my job as a judge. 

Senator, in each chapter I analyzed different potential arguments, one of which was this Libertarian argument. And applied faithfully to its end, it leads to where it leads, as some of the authors of the argument acknowledge. I am not making it up. There are other arguments, though, that one might deploy that I analyze as well. That is not the only available argument for legalization by any means. 

I am a little envious, Mr. Chairman. [Laughter.] 

You can tell him I am very rarely at a loss for words. 

But you got me. 

Senator, on that one, we have what is called the Fifth Amendment, which is part of the Bill of Rights as well, and which, of course, protects the right not to self-incriminate. So I might have to exercise my rights under the Fifth Amendment to that one. 

Wow, spoken like an Arizonan there, the Valley of the Sun.No, our family loves to ski together. That is one of our favorite activities. My daughters are ferocious double black diamond skiers. One of them is——

One of them is right now doing some backcountry skiing out near Telluride, as we speak. So that is something we love to do as a family. 

Near Winter Park, Colorado. It is a resort owned by the City of Denver. And it is where I learned to ski as a kid. My parents would put me on a bus or the train. It was their idea of getting rid of me for the day on the weekend. And I would come back exhausted, which was good, too. They liked to run me ragged that way. 

Oh, now we are talking. I love to fish. And that is where I find a lot of solace. You cannot focus on the worries of the world when you are only worried about a trout. Everything else goes away, just disappears. You are in the most beautiful—trout— trout live in beautiful places. 

They are very picky, and they pick well. So during the summertime, fishing, hiking. I like to row. I like to run. Those are my activities. And I like to read. I like to read novels, good fiction. And if you want to learn how to write, you have to learn how to read. 

Yes, boy, that I found taxing and loved every minute of it. But I have spent a lot of my free time teaching or working on the rules Committee. I have been in the rules process for the last 6 or 7 years now. The Chief Justice kindly appointed me to the standing Committee and then to the appellate rules Committee more recently, and trying to make the rules more sensible so that we can get litigation done more sensibly, cheaper, faster, for all people. It is a wonderful example of government working. People from a variety of walks of life, judges, lawyers, academics coming together and operating more or less by consensus. Imagine that. 

You know, I have. It was when I was at the Department of Justice, and I thought for sure—— [Laughter.] 

Have you served on a jury? 

You know—— 

Thank you. I actually think it is a very excellent question, because I think anyone who has served on a jury appreciates the important civic function that is involved. It is a way citizens actually interact with their government, right? In a very real way. 

No, I thought for sure I would get kicked off. And I guess neither side thought I was the worst one, so I made it through. And I went to the bathroom when we were sent back. And I came out and I had been elected foreman, which I refused to serve as. I just did not think that was appropriate, and I did not want to have undue influence. But the Seventh Amendment and the right to a trial by jury, the only disagreement our Founders had over it was whether it was a bulwark of liberty or the very palladium of liberty. And as a trial lawyer, I had great faith in jurors, in the collective wisdom of 12 citizens to adjudicate a case fairly on the facts. In my time serving on a jury, I wondered, is it going to prove out my beliefs or am I going to come out more of a cynic? I came out more optimistic and a true believer in the jury system than ever. I really believe in the wisdom of juries. 

Oh, there are so many I admire. I admire them all. They all bring something to the table, men, women, from every kind of background. 

You know, the nicest gift I have gotten in the last few weeks, there have been so many prayers, so many wellwishers, so many kindnesses, but the best gift I have gotten was this enormous basket from my four most recent colleagues—I think it was four, whatever. It just happens to be my Obama-appointed colleagues sent me a gift basket, because they knew I was not eating very well, as I was marching around the Senate halls. They said I was looking a little gaunt. That is how we work in the Tenth Circuit. And I am sorry for outing them, but you touched my heart. Thank you. And that is how my colleagues are, all of them. I have served with judges appointed by President Johnson, President Nixon, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush the first, Clinton, President Bush the second, and Obama, and we get along. And I think you are going to hear in a couple days from two formerChief Judges of the Tenth Circuit who have retired now. You are going to hear about how we operate in the Tenth Circuit.It is often reputed to be the most collegial Circuit in the country. Collegial not in some ordinary, pedestrian sense of we are just nice to one another, collegial in a real meaningful sense. We listen to one another, and we value and we respect different points of view, not just tolerate them.

Senator, Federal criminal law imposes very long sentences, and to be a judge complicit in adjudicating criminal cases, I thought I could not close my eyes to what the reality is, and I wanted to see it for myself firsthand my first year on the bench, so I did. 

Senator, I think it started one day after an argument when a few of us were concerned that the quality of representation of death row inmates in our Circuit was not what we would like it to be. And I do not want to take more credit than I am due here. Real people deserve credit, my colleagues, Judge Tymkovich, Judge Lucero, and a whole lot of our staff, Betsy Shumaker, David Tye, many, many others who put together, together with the wonderful judges in Oklahoma, some training sessions, recruited additional lawyers, provided training for those who are already in the system, sought and obtained more funds for Federal public defenders to assist. And a lot of people deserve more credit than I do.

Senator, that was the holding of my court in that case. Colorado had passed by voter referendum a law that, as I recall, sitting here, indicated that 20 percent of energy in Colorado had to be from renewable sources by a certain date. That law was challenged by fossil fuel producers out of State, alleging that it violated what is called the dormant commerce clause under the Federal Constitution and case law interpreting it. And I did write for a unanimous panel that there was no constitutional violation, and the State was permitted to proceed with its experiment. 

Consistent with that principle. 

It is very different than out here, and, yes, I have. Split estates, as you know, are a common feature in the West. And in part, at least, a byproduct of homesteading acts by this Congress, where, initially, as I recall, Congress gave homesteaders rights down to the center of the Earth, as is common out here. Then they found out, my gosh, there is some valuable stuff under there, and they started splitting the estates, so that homesteaders could do what they wanted to do on the surface estate, but that the Congress and the people could control some of the valuable mineral rights underneath. Very complicated stuff. And, yes, I have encountered those cases too. 

I think that is for this body to decide. 

Senator, I have had a number of Tribal cases, and Tribes are, as you know, sovereign nations. And our constitutional order affords this body considerable power in dealing with those sovereign nations by treaty and otherwise.And out West, there are all sorts of variations on that arrangement. There are classic reservations, as many people in the East conceive of them. There are also ancient pueblos that predate this country by many hundreds of years. Then there are allotments to individuals and groups. It depends where you are. That sounds like Oklahoma. Pueblo sounds like New Mexico. And then when I think reservations, I think of Utah and some places in Colorado and Wyoming. And there are variations all throughout the American West.Our history with Native Americans is not the prettiest history. And as a judge, you try very hard to administer the law fairly, without respect to persons, and equally. I would point you maybe to my cases involving the Ute Indian Tribe, where they have had a long time trying to control their Tribal lands, or Fletcher, involving the Osage Nation in Oklahoma and the right to an accounting of the property due them under agreements with the United States. I try to treat all persons who come before me fairly.

Senator, those are policy considerations. As a judge, my job is to look at the law. I would say I do not conceive of Chevron deference as a conservative or liberal issue. I do recall when Chevron was announced, many people thought it was a very conservative decision, because it does advantage whoever has theirhands on the reins of the administrative state at the particular time. And in 1984, that was one party. Today, you know, it may be another party. The next day, it may be another party. So a good judge does not care who it advantages. A good judge looks at the law.

Well, in the first instance, the Administrative Procedures Act is the statute that you would look at.

All precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court deserves the respect of precedent, which is quite a lot. It is the anchor of law. It is the starting place for a judge. And the Chairman kindly held up my overlong book, right? And that is the law of precedent, a very mainstream consensus view by a bunch of judges from across the country who got together and we wrote it down, and it is all in there. And Justice Breyer was kind enough to write a forward to it. And it articulates how a good judge goes about assessing the law of precedent in any case. 

Senator, one of the wonders of our constitutional order is the First Amendment and the right of free exercise. Not many countries in the world are as pluralistic when it comes to religion as this country. It is quite an experiment, really. Most nation-states are one culture, one people, one religion. We are founded on a very different idea that all voices are heard, that people of all faiths and no faiths are welcome, that we are tolerant. It was quite an experiment to launch 200 years ago. It is still an experiment today we are working on and learning to live with one another and mediate it. So the role of religion in our society is profound and always has been, and it is a pluralistic commitment we have in this country that, well, is very special in the world. 

It is just us. 

Senator, I am sorry. I do not remember the first line, but—— 

Oh, yes. Yes, yes. 

Yes, yes. 

I am sorry, Senator. I do not. I apologize sincerely. I do not remember. 

Okay. 

Yes. 

I do. 

Yes, Senator. 

I do. 

Senator, I do not know what was in his mind. You would have to ask him.

Senator, I care deeply about the independence of the judiciary. I cannot talk about specific cases or controversies that might come before me, and I cannot get involved in politics. But I can say a couple of things about that, as you know.The first is judges have to be tough. We get called lots of names all over the place. We have to accept criticism with some humility. It makes us stronger and better. I take it from my teenage daughters. I take it from litigants. This process, there has been plenty of criticism. That is fine.Thomas Jefferson did not much like Marbury v. Madison, and he did not mind saying so. Presidents have tried to pack the Court. That is part of our constitutional history. We have a First Amendment. People can speak their mind.But, Senator, I am sorry, I do not mean to interrupt, but I did want to add one other point, if I may.

But, Senator, when you attack the integrity or honesty or independence of a judge, their motives, as we sometimes hear, Senator, I know the men and women of the Federal judiciary, a lot of them. I know how hard their job is, how much they often give up to do it, the difficult circumstances in which they do it. It is a lonely job, too. I am not asking for any crocodile tears or anything like that. I am just saying I know these people, and I know how decent they are. And when anyone criticizes the honesty or integrity, the motives of a Federal judge, well, I find that disheartening, I find that demoralizing, because I know the truth. 

Anyone is anyone. 

That is right, Senator. 

Senator, I cannot comment on specific cases, and I cannot get involved in politics. I have said what I think I ethically may in this area. 

I think you are going to hear from him yourself on Thursday, and I am sure he will not mind, hesitate, or in any way have any question or fear about saying it to you himself. But I am happy to share it with you, too. The ultimate test of the rule of law is whether the Government can lose in its own courts and accept the judgments of those courts.

Senator, I have gone as far as I can go ethically, with the canons that restrict me, about speaking on cases. I cannot talk about specific cases, and I cannot get involved in politics. Respectfully, I believe I have gone as far as I am able to go.

I appreciate the opportunity to talk about my record because I can talk about that, Senator. My record is when there is a judge who is accused of perhaps using language that might bear on a man’s ethnicity, arguably, in the course of sentencing, a panel of my court on which I sat replaced him. My record is that when an undocumented alien—immigrant, sorry, is not properly represented and there is a history of the lawyer failing his clients in that area, sent him, referred him for dismissal from our bar.

Senator, the independence and integrity of the judiciary is in my bones.

I am, Senator. 

Senator, I cannot say I am aware of each of those statements, but I am definitely aware that there was discussion of litmus tests by lots of people during the election process, yes. 

Yes. 

Very aware of it, Senator. 

He did. 

Senator, what I have testified to is that there was no request for me to commit on any case or controversy or anything that might come before me—— 

There was, briefly. 

Senator, the President recounted to me, among other things, how the campaign went in Colorado. He knew I was from Colorado, and he was disappointed he had lost Colorado. And he said something like if he had had a little more time, he thinks he might have won it. And then he said that one of the topics that came up during the course of the campaign was abortion and that it was very divisive and split people evenly, he found. And then he moved on to other topics. 

I do not think so, not to my recollection, just that abortion was very divisive. And then he moved on to other topics of interest to him. 

Senator, the next topic I remember—and this is just my recollection—is he expressed concern that our country’s nuclear armaments are old. 

No, Senator. That is it. 

Not to my recollection, no. 

To my knowledge, Senator, from the time of the election to the time of my nomination, I have not spoken to anyone that I know of from Heritage. Maybe I shook someone’s hand, but I have not had any substantive conversations that I am aware of that anyone has alerted me to that they are from the Heritage Foundation. 

I do. 

Temporarily, as a preliminary matter. That is my recollection, yes. 

Issued a preliminary injunction or a TRO; probably a preliminary injunction. 

No. No, Senator, I was not. 

They do. 

For the parties there is a time limit prescribed by rule. It is also possible for the court, what we call ‘‘sua sponte,’’ or on its own, to seek rehearing, and there is no time limit prescribed by rule for that. 

That sounds right, Senator. I would not swear to it, but I trust you.

I always check the rules on that sort of thing because I always think I know, and it is 10 days or 14 days, so I always look.

That is right. That is right. 

That is right. 

Senator, that is internal deliberative process that would not normally be revealed, but I have no problem acknowledging that. 

I did. 

No, Senator. That is not correct. 

A preliminary injunction, the Court of Appeals, the panel has indicated, should issue, subject to—this court has to enter it, I believe. I do not think our court entered it directly. As I recall, the parties either reached some sort of agreement with respect to preliminary relief or the court entered it. I do not recall which. But the case proceeded and may still be proceeding for all I know. 

That is right. 

Very narrowly voted against it, Senator. It was a close vote. 

I did. 

Oh, of course. It is an extraordinary thing. We probably hear between zero and three en bancs a year over the course of my time. Do not hold me to that, but it is somewhere in that range, usually. 

Oh, I have done it, Senator. 

I cannot tell you how many times, sitting here. I just cannot. But I can tell you I have done it. And I can tell you, Senator, that about one out of every five en bancs, about 20 percent of en bancs in our court are sua sponte. It is not unusual.

I do not know. I do not know. 

I appreciate the opportunity to answer that question, Senator. En banc rehearings happen sua sponte with regularity in our court, as I say, maybe 20 percent, estimate, of the cases that we have heard during my time have been sua sponte. It is acknowledged in the Committee reports to the rules. ‘‘Wright and Miller,’’ the Bible on civil procedure that every young lawyer lives with, acknowledges the regularity and the propriety of the sua sponte en banc. So just to put that aside. I just do not see any—— 

Of course. 

Of course. I would be very reluctant to reveal internal deliberative processes any further, Senator, of a court, and I do not think you want us to. But I have gone pretty darn far here, and I would be happy to consider any reasonable request that we can talk about that. 

Yes. 

He wrote a special concurrence saying that he thought the panel decision was gravely wrong. 

He decided not to vote for en banc. That is correct. But he thought the panel opinion was gravely wrong. 

And, Senator, if you want me to explain why I sought en banc and the reasons, I would be delighted to do so. 

I appreciate it. 

I understand, but an implication of impropriety, anything like that, Senator, I would appreciate the chance. 

Okay. 

Senator, it is all about standards of review for me. In that case, the parties agreed on the law. There was no dispute of law. In that case everyone agreed that if the Governor has discontinued funding because he opposed lawful abortions, that would be unconstitutional and wrong and would have to be stricken by the Court. That was uncontested.It was also uncontested that if the Governor discontinued funding because of his reaction to videos that you are well aware of involving alleged unlawful action—alleged—then his conduct was lawful and constitutional. The law was agreed by everyone. The only question was: What was the Governor’s intention? That is it. And the District Court made a factual finding that the Governor’s intentions were what he said they were, that he acted in response to the videos. That was his testimony. That was the District Court’s finding. And in a very unusual, I thought, step, our court overturned the factual finding of a District Court and did so on the basis of a putative admission from the Governor’s brief as if the lawyers for the Governor would concede away their case.I read the brief. It did not concede away the case. And it seems to me very important, Senator, that we abide our standards of review and we do not pick and choose the areas of law to start abandoning our standards of review. And a standard of review for clear error, for factual findings is what I wrote about. And I do not care if the case is about abortion or widgets or anything else. When a jury or a District Judge makes a factual finding, that deserves our respect under a clear error standard of review. And as you point out, Judge Bacharach, while he did not think that it rose to the level of en banc review, he thought the panel was clearly wrong. And he happens to be, as you know, just happens to be a Democratically appointed judge, because we are judges first. And, Senator, there were four judges who wanted en banc in that case. That is a large number in our Circuit. There is nothing unusual or untoward about that case at all. It is what we do as judges.

I do not, Senator. 

I would have said it was in the summer, Senator, yes. I would say I have also, Senator, revived partially a lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood in another case. I take the parties as I find them, and I take the facts and laws that come to me. And I do not choose when they come to me or how they come to me. 

And any other implication would be erroneous. 

Yes. 

Senator, Brown v. Board of Education corrected an erroneous decision, a badly erroneous decision, and vindicated a dissent by the first Justice Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson, where he correctly identified that separate to advantage one race can never be equal.

In Plessy, no. Absolutely not. 

Brown v. Board of Education, Senator, was a correct application of the law of precedent, and—— 

Senator, it is a correct application of the law of precedent. 

Senator, there is no daylight here. 

Justice Marshall—sorry, Justice Harlan got the original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause right the first time, and the Court recognized that belatedly. It is one of the great stains on the Supreme Court’s history that it took it so long to get to that decision. 

So Griswold, Senator, as you know, held that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Liberty Clause provided a right to married couples to the use of contraceptive devices in the privacy of their own home. And then Eisenstadt extended that to single persons. 

Senator, those are precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court. They have been settled for 50 years, nearly, in the case of Griswold. There are reliance interests that are obvious. They have been reaffirmed many times. I do not see a realistic possibility that a State would pass a law attempting to undo that or that a court of the United States would take such a challenge seriously. 

Senator, I will give you the same answer.

It was an application of equal protection principles, and——

And, Senator, I am trying to give it to you. And as I recall, Justice Alito said the same thing, which is that there is an equal protection argument. Once you have Griswold in place, then it follows as a matter of equal protection that the same—what was true for married couples is true for single persons, and that was an application of settled equal protection principles.

You know, Senator, a couple of things have made my day recently, and hearing that was definitely one of them. You know, in Colorado, I mean, where I come from, that is big stuff. 

Senator, I will tell you, what meant as much to me, though, was an article I saw not too long ago someone put in front of me from the Albuquerque Journal, and it quoted two lawyers who appear in front of me all the time. One is a civil rights attorney, the other represents indigent criminal defendants routinely in my court. They win some; they lose some. And they both went out of their way to say, ‘‘He is a fair judge.’’ And you know what? The compliment of the people who work with me day in and day out, who win some and who lose some, that means the world to me. 

Do I have to answer this question, Mr. Chairman? [Laughter.] 

I would be happy to share with you privately my views on this subject. 

My experience is, though, that once the word gets out, then it is not my favorite spot anymore. 

Senator, it is the same thing. It does not change. It is a more public role. There may be more civic education involved, or at least an opportunity somebody might listen to you a little bit more. And Justice O’Connor again comes to mind here. But the job does not change, and the law is the law. It is what we do day in and day out. And the discussions about the judiciary I think often miss the fact that judges agree overwhelmingly on thedisposition of cases. A tiny percentage of the cases go to the Supreme Court of the United States, 70, 80 cases a year, a fraction of a fraction of a percent. And even then—even then—the Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are unanimous in their decisions 40 percent of the time.Now, think about that. You have not just three judges who have to agree, as on the Court of Appeals, generally speaking, but nine. Nine Justices who are appointed by five different Presidents right now. And people say the world has changed, but in some ways it has not because that 40 percent number has been remarkably steady since the Second World War. That is a pretty incredible thing when you think about it.

That is a testament to our rule of law. It is human, it is imperfect, but it is sure better than anything else anybody has ever devised. 

No, Senator. And if they had, I would have walked out of the room, period. 

Senator, if that is where the law and the facts lead me, do it without hesitation. It is—I have done it. I have done it many times without respect to who is in charge. I rule for the Government sometimes. I rule for the accused, for the prisoner, for the immigrant, or the student, for the employee, whomever it is, based on the law and the facts of the particular case at hand. And I believe respectfully my record demonstrates that. 

Senator, it really comes from my experience as a lawyer, and General Katyal put it better than I could. But the fact of the matter is I represented plaintiffs, I represented defendants. I represented the big guy, I represented the little guy, however you want to call it. And in each and every case, all I wantedwas a judge who did not decide the case based on his personal beliefs, her personal religion, his politics, what she had for breakfast. I just wanted someone to come in and look at the law and look at the facts, study it as hard as they could, and make as neutral and dispassionate a judgment as they could. That is what I wanted, a human judge, somebody who was a person. It helped if they were kind, but I would take a curmudgeon. There were some curmudgeons. A fair curmudgeon any day of the week I would take.

I wanted a fair judge. And I resolved to myself that I would remember, so long as I was on the bench, I would remember what it was like to be in the well, what it was like to have to make the arguments, because I tell you what, asking the questions is a lot easier than having the answers. I sleep a lot better the night before argument as a judge than I did the night before argument as a lawyer. And so I resolved I wanted to be the kind of judge that I wanted when I was a lawyer. 

Senator, precedent is the starting point for any good judge. Precedent is our history, our shared history, our patrimony; the wisdom of the ages, if you want to think of it that way. And it would be foolish of any judge to come in and think that he or she knows better than everybody who has come before them. It would be an act of hubris. So the starting point and the great anchor of the law, as Francis Bacon called it, is precedent. As Hamilton said, judges, because we are life tenured, need to be bound down by strict rules and precedents. And I take that obligation seriously. 

Reliance is a huge part of it. 

The same way a Circuit Judge approaches a question with Circuit precedent. We do the same thing. Nothing changes. It is the same set of principles. 

Start with a presumption in favor of history, and that people who came before you were just as smart or maybe even smarter than you are. When you put on the robe, you lose the ego. You look at the reliance interests that have formed around the precedent. You look at how long it has been around. You look to see whether it has been reaffirmed. You look at the quality of the initial decision. You look at the doctrine and whether it has been built up around it or whether it has eroded away. You look atworkability. Those are some of the factors a good judge looks at when deciding any challenge to a precedent.

Senator, no decision should be reached lightly as a judge. 

Well, Senator, it is part of the Bill of Rights, like all of the rest of the Bill of Rights, and it was thought important to add as part of the first 10 Amendments to the Constitution as a package. And the thought was to emphasize and make very clear that the Federal Government is a government of enumerated powers, not a plenary government with unenumerated, unlimited power, and that there was reserved to the people and to the States abundant rights. 

Well, Senator, Tenth Amendment cases do come before the Court and related Commerce Clause challenges that are kind of an analog here. So I have to be careful. 

But I would point you to the New York case, Justice O’Connor again, pointing out that there are limits to how far the Congress and the Federal Government may go to commandeer State governments. And then, of course, there is the Chief Justice’s opinion in the ACA case with regard to Medicaid expansion and the limits of the Commerce Clause power there. So there are a couple of decisions that are out there that you are aware of that discuss this issue. 

Well, Senator, I would be happy to, of course. In that case, again, it involved an undocumented immigrant, and the question was whether an agency could overturn judicial precedent retroactively so that this man who had relied on our precedent essentially had the legal rug pulled out from underneath him. And it seemed to me that raised a variety of questions. First, it meant now that he had to wait not 10 years outside of the country but perhaps 13 or 14 because they wanted to retroactively overturn judicial precedent. And I asked in terms of fair notice, advance notice, due process, how is a person, the least amongst us, anyone, supposed to organize their affairs, rely on the law, precedent, if it can be overturned by an agency willy nilly? What are the equal protection implications if the person who declares the law is now a political branch rather than the judicial branch, where selective picking and choosing of winners and losers can be had in the application of the law? I am worried about that. I worry about the separation of power. How is it that an agency can overturn a judicial precedent effectively without the concurrence of Congress? Congress, of course, has the power to write statutes. The last time I checked, that is the legislative power, though, and to overturn judicial precedents on statutory on interpretation, that is this body’s role. So those were some of the things I worried about, and I worried about just the plain old statutory text, too, of the APA in which Congress is assigned the task, of course, of fact-finding to the agencies and told us, again, to provide a highly deferential standard of review to the agencies, the chemists, the biologists, the scientists; but said when it comes to interpreting the law that the courts are supposed to do that. So those were some of the questions that I found difficult in that case. 

Yes. 

Well, the Commerce Clause appears in Article I. Article I affords this body and the House of Representatives the power to legislate interstate commerce, among many other things. That is the Commerce Clause, the non-sleeping, the non-dormant Commerce Clause. 

But we have this sleeping thing over here, and it is the product of judicial interpretation that suggests that sometimes even when Congress has not exercised its powers under the Commerce Clause, States infringe Congress’ authority by stepping into the regulation of interstate commerce themselves in a way that, though Congress has not itself proscribed, would still offend congressional authority. That is the doctrine. 

Okay.

Well, Senator, I have tried to make clear today that my feelings, respectfully, on any of these topics are things I try to leave behind, and I try to take the facts and the law and the precedent before me very seriously. I come here with no agenda but one, no promises but one: to be as good and faithful a judge as I know how to be. That is it. And I cannot promise or agree or pledge anything more than that to this Congress. I just cannot, not as a good judge, not as someone who has to look litigants in the eye and tell them I am a fair and impartial judge of their case, not to someone who respects the separation of powers. So that is where I come from on that.

That is right. Yes, two dissenters did not feel the need to reach that issue.

That is right. 

I have, Senator. 

Senator, I believe in juries. I liked trying cases to juries. I liked being on a jury. I think it is a part of our civic engagement that is really valuable. People feel connected to their Government. Hamilton and Madison, I think it was—I cannot remember which—in the Federalist Papers debated, you know, is it a bulwark of liberty or is it the very palladium of liberty? That is what they thought of the Seventh Amendment. And I think it is just so difficult for litigants to get to a jury now. And we spend so much time in preliminary discovery, what we call discovery, motions practice. Lawyers become poets of the nastygram. They can write interrogatories in iambic pentameter. But there just are not that many jury trials anymore. And I am not sure that is a good thing. 

Yes, Senator. Yes. 

Well, when it becomes so expensive and takes so long to get to a jury, to get to a trial, some people do not bring good claims. A lot of people are left not bringing good claims to court. That is a problem on the one side of the ‘‘v.’’ and I saw that as a lawyer. And on the other side of the ‘‘v.’’ defendants, sometimes you feel like you have to settle, not because the case has merit but because the cost and the delay to the client are so significant in getting to a decision that you cannot afford to do it. You have to get on. And as I indicated earlier, the American College of Trial Lawyers—and both represent both plaintiffs and defendants—have indicated both these problems are real in our system and need to be addressed. 

Yes, Senator. As I indicated earlier, I think the number is something like 5,000 Federal criminal statutes on the books today and hundreds of thousands in the Federal Register, and that 8-point font, I need to bring out my reading glasses for when I pull open the Federal Register. And, you know, I have a hard time reading it. And I have a hard time imagining the American people can read it, to be honest with you. And Madison warned about a world in which law, written law, is lacking, and he also warned about a world in which we would have too much written law, a paper blizzard, so much so that the prosecutor can choose his charges with impunity and the people do not have notice really what is expected of them. So I think both of those things on both ends of the spectrum are a concern, and Aristotle was right there, too. We are looking for a golden mean. 

I would say it has been part of—I do not know about an explosion, but it is just a fact of life that has been with us for a while and growing. 

That is what I am told. 

Enviable. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. No, this has been a great pleasure, a great honor to be here with you, Senator, and with all of your colleagues. 

Senator, I appreciate the opportunity to address that. As I think you have indicated, I was not the author of that opinion. I did not write it. One of my colleagues wrote that opinion. Another one of my colleagues dissented. You are quite right about that.I do not have a dog in the hunt when it comes to holes and openings in floors. But apparently, OSHA does. OSHA distinguishes between floor holes and floor openings when it comes to——

Spaces—— 

Yes. 

With respect, Senator, OSHA regulations do make a distinction between, as I recall, it has been a while—— 

Well, Senator, there are different regulations for floor openings and floor holes in—I think this is an oil and gas rig or maybe a fracking rig. And what you have to do in terms of remediation, cover or a handrail. There are different consequences whether it is a hole or an opening, as I recall. And the party there, nobody was injured, but they got a fine for not doing maybe covering it up, I do not recall, whatever the agency wanted them to do. And the question was whether they had been provided notice they were being charged with whether it was a hole versus an opening. And Senator, all I was trying to do there, I agreed with my colleague who wrote the majority opinion that OSHA charged what it charged it had to prove and that it cannot change the charge in the middle of the proceedings, as I recall. 

Well, that might be true. 

I mean, I do not know. As they say, I do not have a dog in that hunt. I am just trying to apply the OSHA regulation. 

Senator, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this again. The statute there protected individuals who refused to operate a motor vehicle, and at least as I saw it—and this is just one judge, how I saw one case in 10 years—and I saw that the individual drove away. He operated the motor vehicle. So I did not see how he could claim protection of a statute that hinges on a refusal to operate.I am relieved to know that he was able—that he was fine and was able to meet up with his employer 15 minutes or so later, as I remember the record. But my heart goes out to him, and I said that in the opinion that he was put in a rotten position. And I go home at night with cases where sometimes the law requires results that I personally would not prefer.

Well, Senator, I appreciate the opportunity to answer that. If I might, though, I would just point to my record on employment cases. There are plenty of cases where I have ruled forthe employee and not the employer. We can pick one and talk about one, but there are many, many where I have ruled for the employee, even overturning the District Court when the District Court ruled for the employer. Lots of them, and I would be happy to talk about any of them.

But if we want to—— 

I understand. I understand that. 

Senator, I would say that there is lots of room for congressional regulation here and that, in fact, the Supreme Court has made clear that foreign money in particular is an area where Congress has substantial authority available to it. I would say this—— 

Senator, I would say there is ample room in the area of campaign finance for further legislation, all sorts of room where the Court’s made clear, remains. It struck down one law. That does not mean that every law will be stricken. It does not mean that Congress has no role. It means the Congress passed one law that, based on one record, the Supreme Court found to violate the First Amendment. 

Senator, I am not making any promises to anyone about how I would rule. I understand people would like me to make promises, but I just—that is not what a good judge does. It is not fair to the parties. I do not prejudge cases. That would be a violation of separation of powers, in my view. It would be the end of the independent judiciary. Senator, what I would promise you to do is to look carefully at the record with deference to the fact-finder, to look at the briefs, to go through the whole judicial process and carefully consider all the arguments made by both sides, as a good judge does. 

Senator, the first campaign I worked on I was about 9 years old. It was my mom’s. She was running for the State house, and I think it was, again, her idea of daycare that I would walk with her.[Laughter.] 

I did. 

Senator, I have lots of concerns as a person and as a citizen. But I am now a judge, and my personal views have nothing to do with how I rule on cases. 

It is a discipline that a judge learns and exercises and, hopefully, improves upon over time. And I am steadfast about that, Senator. It means—it means the world to me as a lawyer and as a judge who cares about an independent judiciary. It comes from a place deep in my bones. 

Of course. 

Senator, I appreciate that question. The answer is I considered it very closely, very carefully. So did the Supreme Court of the United States, which affirmed our court. And as you know, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act goes above and beyond the First Amendment in protecting religious liberties. It is a judgment made by this Congress that it is free to amend at any time if it wishes. It can eliminate corporations from coverage. It can eliminate the strict scrutiny that is required. And it can eliminate the act at any time. But Senator, I gave every aspect of that case very close consideration. That was an en banc decision by our court. 

I did.

Senator, the sincerity of the belief, I believe, was undisputed by the Government, at least in our court. So I just do not think that was at issue.Are there limits to how far the statute goes? Yes, there are. The Government may force someone to forego and accept a substantial burden on their sincerely held religious belief if it can prove a compelling interest, which the Supreme Court accepted in this case, and can also show that it is the most narrowly tailored way to achieve that compelling interest.It is strict scrutiny. It is the highest standard known to law. And the problem in that case again, as the Supreme Court and my court saw it, was that the Government had managed to find a way to achieve its compelling interest in providing coverage to women in many other cases without requiring any compromise——

Yes. 

You are asking me whether I would, as a judge, decide that someone’s sincerely held religious belief is wrong? 

So that I, as a judge—I just want to make sure I understand the question that I would say that the belief is scientifically invalid and, therefore, not protected by the statute? Is that the question? 

Oh, sometimes a court will hold that a belief is not sincerely held. That is true. That does happen. I have had a case involving just that scenario, and it involved a group of drug distributors who claimed they worshipped marijuana. 

Okay. All right. Okay. 

No. And let me compliment Neal Katyal. When he was Acting Solicitor General of the United States, he confessed error by the Government in that case. That was an admirable move.

Senator, to me, one of the beautiful things about our system of justice is that any person can file a lawsuit about anything against anyone at any time. Any person has access to our courts of justice on any subject, and a judge, a neutral and fair judge will hear it.I think that is a remarkable thing. It does not happen everywhere in the world.

Well, Senator, a lawsuit can be filed on it. What a court will do with it is a matter of judicial process, and we would have to go through assessing what the claim is, what the defenses are, take evidence, hear the arguments, make a decision.

Senator, I give you the same answer that the beauty of our system, and I do not want to eat up your time, but the beauty of our system is that anybody can bring a complaint to court and have an opportunity to be heard under the laws of our land. That is a remarkable thing when you think about it.

Senator, I just discussed this with Senator Blumenthal a moment ago, and I am happy to repeat myself.

I cannot talk about specific cases. That would be improper. And I cannot get involved in politics. That would be another violation of my judicial obligations. So I have to be careful. I have to speak in general terms. I am not talking about any case or controversy. And I am talking about the independence of our judiciary. Judges have to be tough. We take slings and arrows under bright lights. It is part of the job. And we take them from all sides, all day long, every day. Our job is to make decisions, hard decisions sometimes. Sometimes that people do not like. In fact, our job usually makes—I am sorry, Senator. I do not mean—it looks like you wanted to say something?

Senator, I can talk about my record as a judge. I have tried to uphold the dignity of the judicial office in the cases and controversies brought before me. When people—when judges have acted in ways that do not bring repute on the judicial office for making comments that are arguably improper, I have been on panels where we have replaced a judge who has done that.When lawyers fail to fulfill their obligations, I have commented, when appropriate, in cases and controversies properly before me. I have, in fact, even sent a lawyer to referral to the bar.Senator, I have worked to try and provide representation to individuals when I have seen pro se handwritten complaints that seem to me to have merit. I have appointed lawyers in those cases. That is my record as a judge, and I can assure you I am nobody’s rubberstamp.

I do not think I was merely speaking broadly, Senator, with all due respect.

Senator, I am speaking about anyone. 

Okay. 

Obergefell. 

I do, Senator. Yes, of course. 

Senator, I have never expressed personal views as a judge on this subject, and that is because my personal views do not matter. Obergefell is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It entitles persons to engage in single-sex marriage. That is a right that the Supreme Court has recognized. It is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, entitled all the deference due a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and that is quite a lot.

Senator, no, no. Not at all. I am not sure I tracked the question, though. I think it is me, not you.

Senator—— 

May I respond, Mr. Chairman? 

Senator, I have been here for 2 days. I will be here for a third. I hope I have given you some picture of my credentials, my experience, my track record as a judge. I hope I have given you some sense, too, that I have rejected litmus tests since the day I was a lawyer in print for judges. I hope I have given you some view into the way I think about the independent judiciary, about the sort of judges I admire, about the things that I think are important in our separation of powers. I hope I have given you some sense of my track record. Ninetyseven percent of the time, unanimous decisions. Ninety-nine percent of the time in the majority. Been reversed maybe once by the U.S. Supreme Court, that is arguable, in 10 years. I hope I have given you some picture of who I am and my record. No one else speaks for me, and I do not speak for anyone else, Senator. I really appreciate the chance to have this conversation with you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you, Senator. I appreciate it. 

No, I am fine, thank you. 

I have answered to a lot of things, Senator. ‘‘Gorsuch’’ is how I say it, but—— 

That is how I would say it, but—— 

Well, we will forgive you that. 

Senator, that is what it is. 

The Supreme Court has held that political speech is the core of the First Amendment. 

It has. 

Well, as you say, Senator, there was a movie involved.

I remember listening to them on tape at one point, but it has been a while, Senator.

I cannot see it. I am sorry. 

The United States. 

I can try, Senator. I am very heartened by the fact that scores and scores of my former students have written this Committee on my behalf. 

And over the last 7 or 8 years, I have used the same textbook. You can take a look at the teaching manual and you will see exactly what we discussed. 

Seven or 8 years, Senator. 

My daughters would agree with you. 

Oh. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. Oh. 

Senator, thank you. 

I have heard myself speak more today than I am accustomed to. 

I am great. How about yourself? 

Well, Senator, in the Tenth Circuit, we have procedures, and one of the procedures is we make a list of all potential recusal possibilities. And for me it was significant because I had been in the Government in a position where we oversaw a number of different litigating units. That causes a fair amount of recusal right there.And, Senator, I was blessed with an active and robust practice, and partners who went on to do much better without me than they did with me, and they had a lot of clients. And it was my view as a Circuit Judge that I did not want to cause an unnecessary recusal problem later. Sometimes after a court decides a case, a recusal issue pops up. Judges miss things. We are human. It happens.The problem when that happens, of course, is then you have to get a new judge in and start everything all over again. That is a cost to the system that is not insignificant to your colleagues and taxing on them. And it also raises questions, of course, to the parties who have to start all that over, and it cost them money and time. And I did not want to create that kind of problem for the litigants and for my colleagues.And so, I set up a process consistent with the practice of my colleagues. I talked to my colleagues about how they do it, and tried to conform with the practices of the Tenth Circuit as best I could. And as you know, most of the recusals were not really—I mean, ‘‘recusal’’ is not even the right word. They are screened out——

By the clerk’s office before they ever get to me. We are on a wheel. 

And so, I just get the next one on the wheel. Everybody gets the same workload. 

It does not affect our workload, but it does affect confidence in the judiciary and—— 

Yes, Senator. 

I am sure you are going to tell me, Senator. 

Right. 

Senator, generally speaking, decisions based on independent and adequate State grounds are permissible. The primary precedent in this area is Michigan v. Long, a decision by Justice O’Connor. The State has to make clear that it is deciding on independent and adequate State grounds and not resting on the U.S. Constitution. If there is some ambiguity, we may as Federal judges consider it to be a decision based on Federal law. But a State is free to add to the liberties of the people, generally speaking. 

Well, that is Michigan v. Long, and there is a precedent, and there is a test for it. And, again, if it looks like it could have been on the—on Federal—the decision could have been made on Federal grounds, then the Federal court will examine it on that basis. If the State court makes clear that it is independent and adequate State grounds, why then State law controls. 

Well, Senator, we have this thing called federalism. 

Yes, I figured you might. And it is part of our separation of powers, and it is part of how we preserve liberty, right? We diffuse power to protect liberty, and Federalism is a key part of it. 

I have, Senator. And before we get to that, I think it is important to acknowledge there is also intermediate scrutiny.

And, for example, many gender cases. 

The Supreme Court has indicated what you are describing as rational basis with bite. But sometimes if there is a discriminatory animus present, even though there might be a legitimate rational basis one could conjure for the rule, that might fail strict scrutiny, Senator. 

Well, generally speaking, usually speaking, it means that if there is any rational reason that one can conjure for the rule, it stands out of deference to the legislative process. 

It has to be a rational reason, not one that I find personally persuasive, but one that someone could find persuasive. 

That is out of deference to the lawmaking process of this body, Senator. 

It seems so. 

It said that an employee who refuses to operate a motor vehicle has certain legal protections from firing. 

That is what I thought the facts suggested, Senator. 

He is.

He is very good at it apparently. 

He does. 

That is right. 

That is who I am, Senator. 

Oh, Senator—— [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. It has been a long day. 

No. No, no, no. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. Senator, I have loved every minute I have spent with you and with all of your colleagues. I am sure I could conjure something. 

But, Senator, I would not opine on it if I could. It is just not my job. It is just not—my job—as you just read it, that is how I see my job. And I respect my colleagues who see it differently because they did. They wrote a 94-page opinion in that case, a thoughtful one.

And I respect them deeply, and the same thing in TransAm. Sometimes the law is what it is. They see it—I am sorry, Senator. 

No. We just do the best we can, day in and day out, in cases like these, and nobody hears about it. And it is the quiet, quiet work of judges trying to get it right. 

Senator, I am happy to embrace that. I do not reject it. I just am concerned about the level of our discourse in this society today when we are often quick to dismiss one another—Republican, Democrat, whatever. 

Whatever. 

That is not the world I care to inhabit. I care to inhabit the respectful engagement of ideas with every person who comes before me. I do believe the original understanding of a text is very important to a judge, and I do believe any good judge wants to know that information, and I do. 

Yes, Senator. 

It means I am not looking for hidden intentions, trying to get inside, respectfully, your head. I am looking for the words you use. I am trying to understand what they mean, what a reasonable person at that time would have understood they mean, because that is the fixed meaning I can latch onto and say I am enforcing that, not my will. 

No. 

Senator, they do not contemplate a lot of things that arise. Equal protection of the law, unreasonable search and seizure, these are broad terms, but we can give them content by looking to what the original understanding at the time was, all right? What a reasonable person would have understood them to mean, the fish case in the statutory construction scenario.What would a reasonable reader understand that to mean? And it serves a couple of important functions. First, it does not necessarily decide cases. It does not determine outcomes, and no one is looking to go back to horses and buggies.

Right. What it does do is give us a way to communicate with one another that is neutral, that we are aiming at something outside ourselves as a basis for decision. That is part of the separation of powers. Not legislating, judging. 

Second, it is a due process concern. 

It is a fair notice concern. I can charge—I am putting people in prison for long periods of time as a judge. I am complicit in that. And I want to do it on the basis that I know that person had fair notice of the laws that are applicable to him or her. That is important to me, and with all judges. 

Oh, I am sorry. 

I am sorry. 

It means not just the thing itself, but what surrounds it. 

Senator, that is a phrase that has been used in opinions by the Court. 

Senator, the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution, and that is a legitimate function of the U.S. Supreme Court. And in interpreting the Constitution, it necessarily declares in this case or that case. It sets a precedent as it interprets. I come back to the GPS case because I think it is a wonderful example, or Heller. That is another example. You can pick all sorts of examples where the Court is interpreting a textual right in the Constitution or a statute. 

I do not think many people have, Senator. 

I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, Senator. 

That is the way it works. 

Well, Senator, this was in my capacity as a commentator before I became a judge.

And as a student. 

And when I was fortunate enough to get a scholarship to study law and a doctorate, and I know you have spent some time thinking about similar things in a similar place, it struck me as an important and unresolved legal issue that deserved some thinking and a contribution, where I could study and maybe add something to the discussion. Not that I have any great insights or perfect answers in this area. It is hard. 

It is hard. I agree. I agree with that, Senator. And there I expressed the belief that—a conclusion as a commentator that the right to refuse treatment recognized in Cruzan by the U.S. Supreme Court was appropriate. People should be allowed to refuse treatment, go home, die in the arms of their family rather than being poked and prodded. At the same time, I agree with the Supreme Court as well that the right of—question of assisted suicide is primarily a State responsibility. And that is where in Glucksberg and Quill the Supreme Court has left the issue. Then the question becomes, what do you do? It is a question we all have to face. Do you legalize it or do you not? It is a hard question. 

Senator, what I worry about is the least amongst us in those circumstances. 

My concern is that when you have a cheap option and an expensive option, people who cannot afford the expensive option, they are the ones who tend to get hurt—the disabled, the elderly, the weak, minorities. 

So, those are my concerts. I might be right, and I might be wrong. History will tell. And if I am right, great, and if I am wrong, yelling and screaming about it will not make many better at it. It will not make right. It was a contribution, part of a debate, part of a discussion. And I hope it was a respectful and useful contribution that at least one Senator has read, and otherwise, and up until about a month ago, I think primarily occupied a very dusty bookshelf somewhere in a law library. 

Dry. 

Happy to express my view on that. 

Well, with a dry fly, a floating line. 

Well, I have been known to cheat once in a while, and a bead head might go on as a drop or underneath my dry.

Senator, I knew him, but not well. It is a big school. 

We were in different sections, Senator. 

Senator, I respect very much what this body does. I hope my career, my body of work reflects my respect for this institution. As a judge, I have to look at what is presented to me, and I look at everything that is presented to me. Everything that is presented to me. I read everything that is presented to me. And I have used legislative history from time to time, as you have seen, and I know you have read a whole lot of my stuff. I do worry when I am putting someone in prison, for example, or taking—involved in a ruling involving their liberty in particular, about charging them with knowledge of what happens in a Committee room, or a statement that might be presented only on the floor by one individual rather than by the law, that has suffered through the process of compromise, bicameralism in both houses, and presentment and signature by the President, and it goes in the law books. Hidden law can be a problem. I worry a little bit about that, particularly in the criminal context, Senator. It is a matter, again, of due process and fair notice. So, those are the considerations that a judge, I think, always considers: what is fair in terms of due process and fair notice, at the same time being respectful of this institution and the hard work you do for the American people. 

Senator, I am going to hit the hay. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. Thank you very much. 

I have never been to Russia. [Laughter.] 

Thank you, Senator. Thank you. 

Is that a question? 

Mr. Chairman, the standard under IDEA, or, as you said, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the standard that you have articulated is the standard set by the Supreme Court in a case called Rowley, and there are additional precedents in the Tenth Circuit interpreting and developing that standard. And so in that case, Mr. Chairman, the panel was applying settled Circuit law and Supreme Court law. The statute, as you know, balances two very important interests. The interests of children and their families with disability to ensure the child receives appropriate education. On the other hand, it also balances the interests of school districts, for whom these cases can be very expensive and challenging. And that balance is a policy judgment as to how that is made. That is made by this body, and then as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Rowley. Those are the standards we apply, the policy choices of this Congress as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court. 

No, Mr. Chairman. 

It was, Mr. Chairman. 

That is my understanding, too, Mr. Chairman. And of course, I have had other cases involving IDEA where the parents and the child prevailed based on the existing law—The School of the Deaf and Blind case, the Jefferson County case. So it just depends upon the facts and the law in each particular case. 

That is right, Mr. Chairman. 

You have it. I am sure—I have gotten to know some of these guys pretty well over the last few weeks. Some nice folks. 

There is a lot to unpack there, Mr. Chairman. Let me begin by saying I respect all the work that this body does, and a good judge takes seriously everything you do and reads everything put before him or her. You do not close your mind to any argument. You put on the robe, you open your mind.But I think that case illustrates some issues along the lines of what you would asked me to discuss. So the statute there says, and simplifying, that it is a crime to knowingly be a felon in possession of a gun.And our precedent, on the basis of an interpretation about legislative history, and the legislative history was very long in that case, extremely long. The statute goes back, I think, to the 1940s and has been revised many, many times. So one can read a lot of history in that statute, and it can be argued both ways. There is good history both sides cited us.On the basis of its reading of that history, our court took the view that the Government need only prove that the defendant is a felon who is knowingly in possession of a gun, and that was the jury instruction given in that case.The defendant said, well, hold on a second. The word ‘‘knowingly’’ is here. ‘‘Knowingly a felon in possession.’’ How does the word ‘‘knowingly’’ leap over the word ‘‘felon’’ and only touch down at the word ‘‘in possession’’? It defied a bit of grammatical gravity, the defendant argued.And as a matter of plain meaning, I had to agree with him. I did not understand how just reading the words, the plain words on the statutory page, a reasonable person could understand that mens rea element, the ‘‘knowingly,’’ the mental element, to only apply to the second act in the statute, to the possession of the gun, as opposed to the knowing felon status.And the defendant had at least a colorable argument that he did not know he was a felon in that case because the sentencing judge told him he was not a felon, as you pointed out, Mr. Chairman. The sentencing judge I think several times, as I recall the record, and it has been a while since I have looked at it, said more than once to him, if you complete your deferred sentence, you’ll have no felony conviction on your record.So I thought this was a case where the Government had to square its corners. And before you could put a man in prison—I think for 5 years in that case. It may have been longer. Felony possession statutes have rather long sentences attached to them. But the Government should be forced to prove each and every element that the plain language of the statute imposed upon it.And that resort to legislative history to put a man in prison on the basis of legislative history rather than the plain language struck me as a due process, a fair notice problem to that individual.So that was why I wrote the concurrence. I followed our precedent. It was a precedent of the court. I have an obligation to do it, but I also felt I had an obligation to point out the mistake.

Yes. And I did touch on it, and I think notice is the key to the rule of law, that the people can understand what is expected of them. That the law is sufficiently clear that before they are put in prison for 5 or 10 or 20 years, and that is what Federal sentencing statutes require of judges in many, many cases, that were not putting them in prison on the basis of some secretlaw, some hidden, unexpressed intentions or intentions that are very hard to find in the fine print of some book that is not available widely, but on the basis of what is in the statutory books that we are all charged with knowing.

That is a good starting point, right? That the plain text of the statute is usually a pretty good starting point, and reading it as you would expect a reasonable citizen to do so, you know, not a—not a—not a pointy-headed judge.

I am, Senator. 

Mr. Chairman, I am well familiar with your views on qui tam cases. I have had a couple in my Circuit, and I know they have served—— 

That one—that one—the one I have in mind, the little guy won that one. Yes, Mr. Chairman. 

Senator, may I? 

I do not mean to eat up your time or anything, but this is exactly the sort of thing I think I have been trying to convey to Members of the Committee, which is it is my job to decide these cases without respect to persons. There is the little guy, right there. He is a criminal defendant. He is unsympathetic. I completely understand everything you are saying about him. That was all true.The question still, does the Government have to prove what the law requires of the Government or anybody, the big guy? There is no bigger guy than the Federal Government.

And so I am just trying to follow the plain words of the law, ‘‘knowingly be a felon in possession,’’ and the convicting judge told him that he was not a felon. And I follow precedent in that case, Senator. The man is in prison because of—because of precedent. But I do wonder—— 

Okay. 

Of course. 

I understand. 

Yes, he was. 

Yes, yes. 

No, I have got it right here. I have got it right here. Yes. 

And Senator, I am working on 12 years of passage of time here. So my memory is what it is, and it is not great on this. But my recollection—— 

Well—— [Laughter.] 

I will take it. Thank you. I am not sure my wife entirely agrees with you anymore, Senator. But thank you, that is kind. My recollection of 12 years ago is that was the position that the clients were telling us. I was a lawyer. My job was as an advocate, and we were dealing with the detainee litigation. That was my involvement. 

Yes, and I think—— 

Oh, no. 

Yes. 

I know you do. 

Uh-oh. 

Senator, first of all, a good judge starts with precedent and does not reinvent the wheel. So to the extent there are decisions on those topics, and there are, a good judge respects precedent. That is the first point. Second point I would make is it would be a mistake to suggest that originalism turns on the secret intentions of the drafters of the language of the law. The point of originalism, textualism, whatever label you want to put on it, what a good judge always strives to do, and I think we all do, is try to understand what the words on the page mean. Not import words that come from us, but apply what you, the people’s representatives, the lawmakers have done. And so when it comes to equal protection of the laws, for example, it matters not a whit that some of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment were racists, because they were, or sexist, because they were. The law they drafted promises equal protection of the laws to all persons. That is what they wrote.And those—the original meaning of those words, John Marshall Harlan captured them in his dissent in Plessy. An equal protection of laws does not mean separate in advancing one particular race or gender. It means equal.And as I said yesterday, I think that guarantee, equal protection of the laws guarantee, the Fourteenth Amendment, that it took a Civil War for this country to win is maybe the most radical guarantee in all of the Constitution and it may be in all of human history. It is a fantastic thing, and that is why it is chiseled in Vermont marble above the entrance to the Supreme Court of the United States.

I do. 

Senator, I understand your concern, and I share it. I come from a family of strong women. My two teenage daughters, you are right. I want every opportunity for them that a young man has. I have a strong wife. Anyone who knows her knows that. My mother—— 

And Senator, I am daunted sitting here under the lights at the prospect of what is to come, if I am so fortunate to be confirmed, and I am daunted by the job I currently hold. AndI take that trust very seriously, and no one is looking to return us to horse and buggy days.We are trying to interpret the law faithfully, taking principles that are enduring and a Constitution that was meant to last ages and apply it and interpret it to the today’s problems, to today’s problems.And I think if you look at a number of cases where the Court has applied what might be labeled by some as originalism, you will see, for example, in Kyllo, the search of a home with a heat-seeking device. The Court looked back to find out would that be considered an unreasonable search? The technology did not exist, of course. But would something like that have been considered an unreasonable search at the time of the Fourth Amendment’s adoption?And found it is essentially equivalent to a Peeping Tom, and of course, that would have been considered an unreasonable search by the Government. And so a heat-seeking device, thermal imaging, is also a search of a home. That is how we use neutral principles, the law, to apply it to current realities, not to drag us back to a past, but to move forward together as judges applying the law neutrally.

Senator, all I can do is I cannot promise you how I would rule in a particular case. That would be deeply wrong to sit here at a confirmation table, and I think we agree on that, that it would be a violation of the independent judiciary for a nominee to a court to make a promise on any case in order to win confirmation.

I know you do not, and I am really grateful for that. I know you appreciate my position. All I can promise you is that I will exercise the care and consideration due precedent that a good judge is supposed to, and I have written a book on it. This is not something that is just words in a room. This is years of toil in putting together a mainstream consensus view on what precedent is and the law of it with 12 other— 12 judges appointed by Presidents from both sides, with a foreword by Justice Breyer. And I did not expect anyone to ever read it. I think a few people have read it now, probably not—still not that many. But that is my life’s work that sort of thing. I care about the law. I care deeply about the law and an independent judiciary and following the rules of the law.And that is the commitment I can make to you. I cannot promise you more, and I cannot guarantee you any less.

Sure. 

And Senator, this is something I can speak about because I have written about it, and I am delighted to talk about my record. I wrote a book in my capacity as a commentator. It was my doctoral dissertation, essentially, before I became a judge. I would have to tell you, as a judge, put that aside, and we talked about that. But I will talk to you about what I wrote in the book because I think it is fair. What I wrote in the book was I agree with the Supreme Court in the Cruzan decision that refusing treatment—your father, we have all been through it with family. My heart goes out to you. It does. And I have been there with my dad and others. And at some point, you want to be left alone. Enough with the poking and the prodding. I want to go home and die in my own bed in the arms of my family. And the Supreme Court recognized in Cruzan that is a right in common law to be free from assault and battery, effectively, and assumed that there was a constitutional dimension to that. I agree. 

And Senator, the position I took in the book on that was anything necessary to alleviate pain would be appropriate and acceptable even if it caused death. Not intentionally, but knowingly. Okay? I drew a line between intent and knowingly.And I have been there. I have been there. 

In certain circumstances, yes. 

That is part of the state of the law, Senator. 

Senator, it guarantees married couples the privacy in their own home to use contraceptives.

It is, Senator. 

Well, Senator, under the law of precedent, you look at the age. This one’s over 50 years. You look at the reliance interests, which are obvious and substantial. You look at whether it has been reaffirmed, which it has many times. And Senator, as I said yesterday, I just cannot imagine a State attempting to pass a law like that. 

And I cannot imagine the Supreme Court of the United States taking that claim seriously.

Senator, you listen to every person who comes to court.

Right. 

Well, you would have to have to have a State that would pass a law like that. 

Or whatever. And then you would have to have somebody try and enforce it. 

You would apply the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and if they were trying to overturn the precedent, you go through the factors and you consider them. 

That is right, Senator. 

I do not see it as a real threat today, Senator. 

Senator, as we spoke of yesterday, I am happy to be called that. I do worry about the use of labels in our civic discussion to sometimes ignore the underlying ideas. As if originalism belonged to a party, it does not. As if it belonged to an ideological wing, it does not. 

Of course it is. It is the whole point of how you interpret the law. 

I do. 

I think you are going to hear from some of them tomorrow. 

I am very honored by their assessment. 

That is right. 

Maybe. [Laughter.] 

Well—— 

Well—— [Laughter.] 

Maybe. 

Senator, I spoke of when anyone. 

Anyone. 

Criticizes the honesty, the integrity, the decency of Federal judges and what they do or attacks their motives in how they come about arriving at their decisions, I know those people.I know how hard they work and how decent they are. I find that disheartening and demoralizing. That is what I have said.I am not saying we are immune from attack from decisions. I am not saying that we shouldn’t have thick skin. My hide is pretty thick, and I know that the hides of Federal judges have to be.

Senator, what it means is I will, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed, go through the same process I did when I became a judge on the Tenth Circuit, and which I committed to do at that time, which was look at the applicable law, look at the facts. I had a law clerk—I do not know if he is somewhere around here.

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

He is a former client, and I treated him as I treated my former clients, large and small. And, Senator, I would have to look at the recusal standards that are applicable to Supreme Court Justices. 

Yes. 

And, Senator, I would just have to study the law and the practice of the Court just as I did when I came on the Tenth Circuit, and I commit to you the same process and the same integrity of the process. You look at the law, you look at the practice of your colleagues, you consult with your colleagues. That is what I did. I had a law clerk prepare an extensive memorandum for me in which he analyzed all of the relevant precedents, the practices of my colleagues, and the facts. 

Well, Senator, I do not want to deal with a case that might come before me, and those are the sorts of things that come before me. But I can speak generally, and I am happy to. 

Presidents make all sorts of arguments about inherent authority. They do, and that is why we have courts to decide. Presidents of both parties have made arguments, for instance, about the War Powers Act, both parties. And the Congress hastaken a different position on that matter, for example, with both parties.And the fact is we have courts to decide these cases for a reason, to resolve these disputes. And I would approach it as a judge through the lens of the Youngstown analysis——

Senator, sitting here—— 

I cannot think of one off hand, Senator. 

Yes. 

That is the rule of law in this country, Senator Leahy. And Presidents for a long time have said all sorts of things like that. President Jefferson said things like that. 

President Jackson—— 

But Presidents say these things, right, Congress says things, and then judges decide. And that is the way our system works. And, Senator, all I can commit to you, again, is I am a judge now. I take that seriously, and you had better believe I expect judicial decrees to be obeyed. As I said yesterday, a wise old judge, who you are going to hear from tomorrow, one of my heroes says that ‘‘The real test of the rule of law is where a government’’—government—‘‘can lose in its own courts and accept those judgments.’’ 

The emoluments clause, Senator, is not a clause that had attracted a lot of attention until recently, but—— 

I am with you. And among other things, it prohibits Members of the Government of this country from taking emoluments, gifts from foreign agents. And the question is, what exactly does that mean, and that is a subject on which there is ongoing litigation right now, Senator, I believe, certainly threatened litigation, impending litigation. And I have to be very careful about expressing any views.

Well, I am hesitant to discuss any part of the Constitution to the extent we are talking about a case that is likely to come before a court, pending or impending. And I do think that the emoluments clause has sat in a rather dusty corner for a long time until recent headlines, and I know that there are cases that are at least impending in that area.I would be happy to try and talk about things that are not likely to come before me, but I cannot——

Well, Senator, that is a—that is a good question. I do not believe it has been fully resolved.

Right. 

Sure. I thought you were asking what would be the remedy if they violated it. 

You are absolutely correct. Of course, Senator. 

Well, no, you have read the—— [Laughter.] 

I know you do. 

Senator, the Voting Rights Act was passed by this body during the civil rights era in order to protect civil rights.

In 2006 it was reauthorized with the support of the President, that is right. And that is true, and it is designed to protect the civil rights of Americans.

Senator, I do not speak for Justice Scalia. I speak for myself.

Senator, I mean no disrespect to any other person in saying they do not speak for me, and I do not speak for them, you know. I have great admiration for Justice Scalia, as we have talked about. I have admiration for every Member of this Committee, and for the President of the United States, and for the Vice President of the United States. But, respectfully, none of you speaks for me. I speak for me.I am a judge. I am independent. I make up my own mind. 

I am. 

Well, Senator—— 

I think, you know, classically we have talked about felonies that have been typically what this body has impeached individuals for. There have been a variety of cases involving sadly Federal judges, as well as Presidents, as well as a Justice attempt. And usually it has been more along the high crimes rather than the misdemeanors. 

I would not want to issue an opinion on that without the full judicial process, Senator. 

I do not know. I know misdemeanors in 1789 looked a lot different than misdemeanors today. We have a lot more criminal law today and a lot more misdemeanors today than we did back then. I can say that. 

No, Senator. 

Senator, I have enforced all manner of regulation that is lawful without respect to my personal point of view. 

Senator, whether I did or did not is not material. 

I would be happy to, Senator. 

Section 706 of the Administrative Procedures Act says basically two things, and I am paraphrasing. It says the courts are supposed to defer to the factual findings of agencies. So, to the extent you are talking about expert biologists, chemists, whatever manner of regulatory expertise we are talking about there, the courts are to defer to that and to take that seriously.And we do, just as we would, say, the factual finding of a jury or a District Court Judge that comes to us with a presumption of correctness. Clear error standard of review, very hard to meet.Section 706, however, also goes on to say that when it comes to questions of the law, the courts are to interpret the law. Despite that command from this body, the courts have created a doctrine that says that if there is any ambiguity in the law, the agency gets to make the decision about what the law means.And I have questions about that doctrine. I have raised questions about whether that is compatible with the plain language of Section 706 and the instruction of this body. And I have raised some questions that arise in a case that I actually had to deal with and how it would impact people, real people, if agencies can change the meaning of the law back and forth every 4 years, depending upon the outcome of an election.For example, what happens when some individual—I am not worried about large corporations here honestly, Senator Hatch. They have got armies of lawyers, lobbyists. They can predict which way the wind is drifting in the agency. Sometimes they can capture the agency. I am worried about the ordinary American, and sometimes even the non-American.The case happened to involve an undocumented immigrant. That is the case I actually dealt with, and there he faced two competing statutes. One said he could rely on and seek permission to remain in the country from the Attorney General and get immediate discretionary relief. The other statute said he had to wait out of the country 10 years.Our court interpreted the law as Section 706 says we are supposed to, and said the first statute controls because there was an apparent conflict between the two, and said he could rely on the opportunity to seek immediate discretionary relief. He did in reliance on that judicial precedent.Then the agency comes in years later and says we are wrong. Chevron. Sprinkle Chevron on it. We have to overturn our decision, and he has to leave the country, and wait not just 10 years now, but 13 or 14, or whatever it was. And to me, that raises questions not only about the consistency with Section 706 and the instructions that Congress has given us, but due process and fair notice.If the law can change so easily, not through bicameralism and presentment to the President—bicameralism in this body, passage of both houses, presentment to the President—the order specified for law making in the Constitution. If the law can change so easily as that, where is the due process to the individual, the person who does not have an army of lawyers? How is he supposed to figure that out?What about the equal protection problems when you allow an agency to pick and choose unfavored targets for changes in law? They do not have to go through bicameralism and presentment. They can pick their targets with more or less impunity, the least amongst us, the most vulnerable, the little guy, if you will, the person without the lobbyists.And then, what about the separation of powers? I thought that judges were supposed to say what the law is. I thought that is what Justice Marshall said. And I thought the point of havingjudges decide the law is because you want someone who is neutral and independent to say what the law means, someone who does not have a dog in the hunt.So, those were the questions I raised in that case. I did it as a Circuit Judge because part of my job as a Circuit Judge is to identify problems that I see for my bosses.So, Senator Hatch, that is a long-winded answer, and I am sorry for it, but I hope it is helpful.

Senator, as lawyers we play different roles in different places in our lives, and depending upon who our client is at the time. As a private lawyer, I represented plaintiffs and I represented defendants. I represented large corporations. I represented individuals in class actions and pension funds—public employee pension funds, CalPERS, for example. I represented hospitals, doctors, victims, defendants.So, where you stand as a lawyer changes. You are someone’s voice. You are your client’s voice. So, that is in private practice what a lawyer does consistent with the rules of ethics and the law of the land as best they can. And often those are hard things because your client’s interests always butt up against another person’s.And sometimes I ask whether our rules of ethics are all that great. One of our rules of ethics, when talking about the zeal a lawyer should exhibit, says that a lawyer does not have to engage in offensive tactics. Well, how is that for a professional promise? We do not have to engage in offensive tactics. I do not know. Only a lawyer could love that.At any rate, moving to government practice, there are policymakers who are the clients. The President of the United States, the Attorney General, the Cabinet officials, they are the policymakers. The role I served in was in a litigation capacity supervising casesand controversies, civil lawsuits involving the United States as my client. I was in the role of an advocate in those cases.As a judge, you put that aside. You put aside all the stuff you did as plaintiff or defendant in private practice, all the stuff you did as a government lawyer, and you only have one client now, the law. You wake up every day, and you just try and get it right as best you can.And Justice Jackson is who comes to mind here to me. He was— he was one of the finest and fiercest advocates of his day, and one of the fiercest advocates of Executive power when he was Attorney General of the United States during the New Deal for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When he became a judge, he also became one of the fiercest critics of Executive power as a judge, because he knew the difference in the roles that we serve. And he said, ‘‘A robe changes a man or should.’’And I believe that, and I have seen it. I have seen so many fine lawyers go on to be very fine judges and put aside their personal points of view, or their clients’ perspectives, or which side of the V they served on, or what sort of client they served, and become neutral, fair judges. At least that is what I have aspired to be for the last 10 years.

Senator, we all have roles to play. When we choose to take up a role in our Government, we all have a particular place in it, and we have to respect the boundaries of it. And it is my job to respect in part the boundaries of this branch, and not engage in the temptation to legislate through the cloak of a judicial robe. Judges would make very poor legislators.

I respectfully disagree, Senator. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. I have great, great respect for this body, and I know——

I know in our civic culture today there is a great pessimism about our Government. I do not share that. I think this body still works, and I think it is important and vital that it work, because it is the people’s voice. It is people’s representatives. It is where lawmaking is supposed to occur. And for you to do your job, it is important that I do not do your job. It is important that I do my job and let you do yours. If judges became legislators, we would be bad at it, and we would absolve you from your responsibilities. You could wash your hands of it. It sounds like some might want to do that. I do not know. You are smiling. But, respectfully, I am poorly equipped. I am not—I am not a representative of the people. I am not answerable to the people, and I do not have the expertise of your wonderful staffs are sitting behind you. My job is to decide cases, and I really—I am okay at that on a good day, right? I am never going to be good at your job, and I need to respect that. And I need—it is also very important for legislators to respect that we do what we do, and that we do not run campaigns, and we do not make promises about how we rule in cases and controversies that come before us. That is part of the mutual respect for the separation of powers. 

Senator, I am here to testify to you that is not how I see our judicial system operate. 

We resolve hundreds of thousands of cases every year in the Federal system, almost all of them, as I say in the Tenth Circuit, for example, unanimously. It is a remarkable thing that even when we get to the Court of Appeals, only 5 percent of all cases get so far as my court, and even then, of those over the last 10 years, we have been unanimous 97 percent of the time in the cases I have participated in. That is a wonder. That is an amazing accomplishment. That is the rule of law in this country. And too few people know how it actually works, and if they did, they would be heartened. 

Yes, sir. 

Senator, I really appreciate the opportunity to respond to that, because I just saw the opinion. It was handed to me as I was headed to the bathroom a moment ago. I guess it was just handed down.Let us start with the Luke P. case and work forward from there. Luke P. was a unanimous decision by my court. It included on the panel of three judges an appointee who happened to be appointed by a Democrat President. There was no dispute in my court about the applicable law, and there was not because we were bound by Circuit precedent, a case called Urban v. Jefferson County, 1996, that said that the appropriate standard was de minimis. The educational standard had to be more than de minimis. That is the law of my Circuit, Senator. And I have been asked an awful lot about whether I abide precedent and whether I always like the results that I reach. Here is a case for you. 

Senator, if I might finish—— 

I would appreciate the opportunity to finish this. If anyone is suggesting that I like a result where an autistic child happens to lose, it is a heartbreaking accusation to me, heartbreaking. But the fact of the matter is, I was bound by Circuit precedent and so was the panel of my court and had been bound for about 20—well, 10 years by the standard in Urban v. Jefferson County. Now, Senator, there are other cases where, again, unanimously, my court had ruled for children with disabilities under this law. The School of Deaf and Blind, another Jefferson County case, are examples where I joined, participated, or wrote in IDEA cases for the family under our binding standard. I understand today that the Supreme Court has indicated that the Urban standard is incorrect. That is fine. I will follow the law. Now, sometimes—I think it was Justice Jackson who said just because I made a mistake unknowingly yesterday does not mean I should make a mistake knowingly today. I would invoke him here. I was wrong, Senator. I was wrong because I was bound by Circuit precedent, and I am sorry. 

I am going to try to apply the law, and I can tell you that we were doing it unanimously in all of those cases. And the Supreme Court is our boss, and we respect their last word. They are final. 

I am sure they were unanimous panels, Senator, if you look.

Senator, all I can say is what I have said to you before, which is a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit following 10-year-old Circuit precedent, including a Democrat colleague—I do not view my colleagues as Democrats or Republicans—followed our Circuit precedent.And these cases have been decided unanimously, I think all of them, if I had to guess, that you are pointing at.And to suggest that I have some animus against children, Senator, would be mistaken.

I am glad to hear it. 

Senator, there was no dissent in that case. 

Senator, he was my dissertation supervisor. He wrote none of my book. And I have written none of his work. 

Absolutely. 

As every good dissertation supervisor would do. 

I believe so. 

Senator, as the book explains, the Supreme Court of the United States has held in Roe v. Wade that a fetus is not a person for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the book explains that. 

That is the law of the land. I accept the law of the land, Senator, yes. 

Sure. 

As recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in Gideon v. Wainwright, Senator, yes. 

Oh, I am sure I have, Senator.

I would be happy to. So, Senator, under the Sixth Amendment Strickland test, before you reverse a conviction or a plea deal, you have to find two things. First, you find whether there is ineffective assistance. But that is only part of the equation because the Supreme Court, Justice O’Connor, said we do not reverse where there is no prejudice. So you have to show prejudice as well, ineffective assistance plus prejudice, before reversal occurs. So oftentimes, you will have cases where there was ineffective assistance. But at the end of the day, you cannot say there was a harm or a foul. Now, that is a counterfactual hypothetical that you have to ask yourself, and it is a hard question. 

In Williams v. Jones, the question was one of prejudice, in my mind, as I recall. 

I do not recall what I said on that subject. What I do recall saying is, whether there was or was not ineffective assistance with respect to providing the plea deal, communicating itto the client, the gentleman had a fair trial, and he had what everybody admitted was a full and fair trial. And——

And, Senator, the question was whether there is prejudice in light of a fair trial that took place, and that was the question that the court had to consider. I accepted—I think I accepted that there was deficient performance or ineffective assistance. And the question was one of prejudice. And the Sixth Amendment is about a fair and free trial for all individuals. And this gentleman, by everyone’s admission, had one. He admitted he had a fair trial. 

And so—— 

Well, that was question. 

Yes. 

It was a 5–to–4 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court—— 

A closely divided decision. And you are absolutely correct that Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority and said that, in the context of a plea deal, even if there is a fair trial, prejudice will be presumed on the basis of a plea that might have been accepted, could have been accepted, that could have averted a fair trial. And that is the standard, Senator. And since the Supreme Court has announced it, I have faithfully applied it. 

I am doing fine. Thank you. Great. 

Yes, Senator. More than that. 

A few. 

It was handed to me on the way to the bathroom. 

I do not recall. You—— 

That is right.

Of course, Senator. Absolutely. That is my job, to follow the law that you pass as best we can, to the best of our abilities, consistent with our own Circuit precedent interpreting law.

I am not sure that was quite her question, in fairness, and I do not she think she implied that, and I certainly would not.

Of course, by its very terms, its express terms. 

The Supreme Court of the United States has made that very clear. 

I would be very happy to, Senator. Excuse me. I would start by saying that a good judge entertains all arguments from all comers. So you read the briefs as presented to you. You do not tell people what they can and cannot argue, generally speaking. There are more and less persuasive arguments to be made, but people get to make their arguments.I believe in trial lawyers, for example, getting to try their cases, and appellate lawyers getting to argue their arguments and leaving them space and the courtesy and room to do that.So I do not believe it is my job to tell people how to argue their own cases. It is presumptuous of a judge.I would say that it is well-known, and I think appropriately so, that the law that governs is what this body passes, in connection with the House of Representatives and signed by the President.That is the law. That is all that is the law, nothing more and nothing less. And everything else stitched around it is not law. And it may or may not have persuasive value in interpreting and understanding the law, but it is not law.The Founders in the Constitution prescribed a process for making law, and they made it hard. They made it really hard. That was the part of separation of powers they really believed in. They did not want lawmaking to be easy because they wanted to preserve the liberty of the people. So they divided the lawmaking authority between two bodies, and they required the signature of the President or a legislative override. Tough process. Not the case in every country in the world or even in every State.So that is what law is. And there are some due process considerations in this area, fair notice considerations in this area, that I take seriously. That we charge people with notice of the law—generally speaking, ignorance of the law is no excuse.We assume that it is reasonable for the people to be on notice of all 5,000 Federal criminal laws that this body has passed. Is it also reasonable to expect them to know all the floor statements that have been issued about the law, everything that might have been entered into the record but not discussed by unanimous consent?Is that reasonable? Is that fair notice? Is that due process? And these are not idle considerations, because, more often than not, we are talking about a criminal statute, and we are talking about whether someone goes to prison, Federal prison, for a long time. And I have concerns about relying on things that are not law and charging people with notice of things that are not law as a basis for putting them in Federal prison. That is the concern. So I hope I have addressed your question, Senator. 

‘‘Backward’’ does not mean backward, Senator. The role of the judge is to say what the law is, the great Chief Justice Marshall declared in Marbury v. Madison. Our job is to say what the law is.So, for example, in a criminal case, when we are interpreting a statute and whether it permits a man or woman to be sent to prison, we are charging with knowledge of the law as it was at the time he or she committed his alleged crime. We are saying this is what the law is. This is what it means. This is what it meant at the time you committed a crime.That is backward-looking. That is what I mean by backwardlooking.We resolve cases and controversies over things that happened in the past, disputes from the past, a crime committed, a breach of contract, a business dispute, a landlord-tenant problem, whatever it may be, it is a case or controversy that, by the time it gets to the Court, is in the past. We are asking what the law was at the time that the events in question took place.That is our job, and we are saying what the law was, what it is. 

Yes. We look backward, in the sense, in the sense of looking to historic facts in the cases and controversies between the people that have arisen, and saying what the law at that time was, and what they can reasonably be charged with notice of. Your job as legislators, eh, you are not concerned with history. You are concerned with the future. You are concerned with writing new laws of general applicability that govern our society and our social coordination problems going forward. 

I would hope no one would reach that conclusion, Senator.

Thank you. 

Thank you, Senator. I believe what I said yesterday is that Congress is the primary organ for lawmaking in our legal order, and that Congress has ample authority and opportunity to pass campaign-finance regulation, including disclosure laws, that Buckley v. Valeo expressly recognizes the power of Congress, especially in the area of disclosure—— 

And, Senator, you are mistaken. I never said reliance interests for corporations. 

That is what I said, Senator, and that is because that is the law. In the law of precedent, we look to reliance interests. And when it comes to the First Amendment—— 

That is the law precedent, yes.

Precedents, Senator. We follow precedent. 

And one of the precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court—if you want to call it a principle, I am not going to argue with you—in Buckley v. Valeo had to do with disclosure. And the Supreme Court expressly recognized that, under the First Amendment, Congress and the States, who have actually been busy in this area, as you know, legislating, have the power to pass laws requiring disclosure, up to a point. There comes a point—there is a point that the Supreme Court has also recognized in NAACP where disclosure can be used as a club. 

Yes. 

Senator—— 

Senator, I never said any such thing, and I would not, and I have not. 

Yes, exactly. 

Very important facts. 

Every case, every precedent, is built around its facts. That is absolutely right. 

Senator, if I might? 

We were talking about disclosure requirements, as I recall.

I believe we were talking about disclosure requirements and First Amendment doctrine, and I indicated that Buckley v. Valeo has given this Congress, if it chooses, the opportunity to pass laws in this area expressly. And all I acknowledged is that there does come a point at which one has to worry at the other end of the spectrum under existing Supreme Court precedent, and that is the NAACP principle.And, Senator, that is it. That is all I have said. 

I have not—I have not—— 

And to read anything else into that—— 

Would be a mistake. 

Of course there is. 

Well, Senator, as you know, corporate speech, when it comes to the First Amendment, does not receive the same protections as individual speech. There is a difference in the doctrine there. So that is an example, perhaps, of an instantiation in law of some of the concerns you are expressing. Another instantiation example to me is antitrust law, the Sherman Act passed by this body and interpreted by the Supreme Court over many years now, trust-busting-era stuff. And it does try to keep competition as an important value in our legal system. 

Senator, here I think of Buckley again and its recognition that corruption and the appearance of corruption are legitimate interests that Congress can pursue in legislation. And that is an example of, I think, the principle you are talking about, which Citizens United also speaks of.It says there the record before it did not satisfy the Court that Congress’ legislation in that particular case had established a case of corruption. I understand you disagree with that, but it did recognize that corruption and its appearance remains an area where Congress may legislate in the future.

Senator, what I—I have a couple reactions to that, if I might.

No, I am going to start—I am going to start with that, but there is one other observation I want to make——

Beyond it, if I might. Okay. Thank you. I want to promise you what I promise every litigant, and I hear a litigant before me, asking for an overturning of a precedent. That is what I hear. And I hear arguments for that. And arguments for overturning precedent include changed circumstances, and that is what I am hearing. That is the kind of nature of argument that I am hearing. That is something a judge takes seriously, of course, always. And any litigant can come to court and argue anything. That is the beauty of our system. I will follow the law of judicial precedent in this area and every other area put to me. I will make no promise for the result in any case. That is not what judges do. We listen to the cases put to us. 

I understand. 

And I am telling—— 

I will follow the law of judicial precedent in this and every other area, Senator, is my promise to you. The other thing I would say that I would like to say is—two other things. One is, there is room for—for not just further litigation, Senator, but for legislation in all of these areas. If there are changed circumstances that Congress observes, it is free not just to bring a lawsuit but pass a bill—— 

In any of these areas. And finally, Senator—— 

May I just finish? 

Of course. Of course. The last thing I want to say is I am distressed to hear you think that judges or the Supreme Court is an organ of a party. That, to me, is just—I know you feel that way, and that distresses me. 

And I just do not—— 

And I just do not see judging that way, and I do not see our rule of law that way. I do not see Republican judges, and I do not see Democrat judges. I see judges. 

And, Senator, I think the rule of law in this country works, and it works so well that to speak like that diminishes what we have. And it is, for me, a failure to appreciate the beauty of our system, that we resolve hundreds of thousands of cases a year almost always unanimously as judges; that the disputes are limited to a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent; and that once we resolve them, through the dispute process of litigation where we have precedent, that settles that problem and we can move on to the next one. 

It is a miraculous system, really. 

I really appreciate you pointing that out. 

Thank you. 

I would like to, if I might, just briefly, Senator. 

Just to cheer you up a bit, I hope, about the judicial process, I think that you are right, that there are some 5– 4 decisions. There are. But what that overlooks, I think, Senator, are some facts that I shared, I hope, with the American people yesterday, that even at the Supreme Court, where they take the 70 or 80 hardest cases every year, where Circuit Judges disagreed— and even then, only about 5 percent of cases get to me; that is what we are talking about, a fraction of a fraction of 1 percent of the cases—that they are unanimous with nine Justices appointed by five different Presidents 40 percent of the time. It is a remarkable thing. 

We should be proud of it. We should be proud of it. 

I agree. 

Nobody will capture me. 

Yes. 

I am aware of it. 

Yes, Senator, and I really want to thank Judge Tacha and Judge Henry, both of whom are retired from the bench, for having gone out of their way to write that article together and to come to Washington. And I think you are going to hear from them tomorrow. One happens to be a Republican-appointed judge; the other happens to be a Democrat-appointed judge. And, again, I do not buy into those labels. They are judges. And they both led the Tenth Circuit, and they are people I admire greatly and esteem personally. And so you are absolutely right. I would face the possibility of a recusal motion, and I would have to face the litigant in front of me, who would say, quite reasonably, look me in the eyes and say, ‘‘How can you be fair in my case when you have already opined on its contents in front of the United States Senate?’’ And to be honest with you, Senator, I do not know how I would look them in the eye. And whether that means I am on the Supreme Court of the United States, if fortunate enough to be confirmed, or I go home to Colorado and those cases come before me, I am still faced with the same predicament, yes. 

No, Senator, which is why we have a judicial canon that prohibits me from opining on cases that might be pending or impending. And, Senator, there is a second reason that I think is vitally important, too, and it goes beyond the parties. It goes to the integrity of the judiciary itself. If persons coming to this table, this rather lonely table in this rather big room, have to make promises or hints or previews or nudges and gestures about how they are going to rule in cases, then I do not know where we are as an independent judiciary.It is like a campaign promise for office, it seems to me. And you know what? It has not happened so far. The precedent in this area is strong, and I admire it. I have looked back. I am no expert. I have not read every jot and note. But Justice Ginsburg, Justice O’Connor, Justice Souter, Justice Scalia, all of them declined to offer hints and previews. And, Senator, I am not going to be the first judge to come to this table and break that tradition and compromise the integrity of the independent judiciary.

That is right. 

I am not going to be that link, whatever happens to me. 

Senator, I should hope that is never any person’s motive. 

That would be, I think, a poor day for the United States courts. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I would have to go back and look at it carefully, but, no, I would not agree with that. My recollection is that the Tenth Circuit precedent was very clear, that ‘‘some’’ meant more than ‘‘de minimis.’’ ‘‘Some meaningful educational benefit’’ in Rowley was a Supreme Court precedent and that our court had interpreted that to mean more than de minimis, and that a number of Circuits had come to the same conclusion.The Supreme Court did not take this case just for fun. It took it because there was a Circuit split on this issue. And the Tenth Circuit was with the Third Circuit, and I believe there are probably some others. I would have to go back and look at it. You have it before you.

Yes, so that is what happened. That is what the Supreme Court does, is when Circuit Judges disagree in the rare cases, and this is—— 

And to suggest that we were in any way out of the mainstream or that I was doing anything unusual there would be mistaken because it is the standard used by many Circuits up until, I guess, today. 

Of course, which—— 

It is just wonderfully reaffirming to me, Senator, that, again, even in cases where Circuit Judges disagree—and here is one where there was a Circuit split. And as you point out, it sounds like a lot of Circuits on both sides of the issue, and a technical issue and maybe a little nerdy, as you say. But that is what we judges do. We are trying to follow the precedent as best we can. Sometimes we get disagreements. And then the Supreme Court, exercising collegiality, comes together and resolves it. 

That is how our system is exactly supposed to work.

I disagree. 

Senator, I have written cases for families in IDEA cases, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. I have written decisions against the families in these cases. And in each case, Senator, it has been based on my assessment of the facts and the law. And the opinions I have issued or not issued have been based on my assessment of the facts and the law, not any personal animus, not any wrong motive, Senator. I can assure you of that. And any suggestion otherwise would be mistaken. And, Senator, all of these opinions in the Tenth Circuit that we are talking about have been unanimous, every one of them, including this one. And, Senator, to suggest that it is somehow out of the mainstream, I would respectfully ask you to look at who joined the opinion, and you will find one of my colleagues who happened to be appointed by a Democrat joined that opinion. And you will see other opinions where I have joined Republicans and Democrat-appointed judges ruling for the family. And so, Senator, all I can say is I was trying faithfully, to the best of my ability, to follow Supreme Court precedent in Rowley, the Tenth Circuit opinion, as I understood it in Urban, and a num-ber of other Circuits had interpreted Rowley in the same way. And my colleagues, subsequently after me, interpreted it in the same way. This decision that was under review was by another separate panel of the court, the one that just went to the Supreme Court. My colleagues in a separate panel, made up, I believe, again, of Republican and Democrat-appointed——

Well, I am happy to explain that—— 

I always try to stick to the text, Senator, with respect. And in this case, again, I was following a Tenth Circuit precedent that was 10 years old at the time, and sometimes the Tenth Circuit will often adopt standards from other Circuits that it finds persuasive. And it may have in that case, you say, adopted it from the Third Circuit. I do not have it in front of me, but I believe you. And often my colleagues will adopt—and I will, too— standards by other Circuits. Rather than reinvent the wheel, we will say we agree with another Circuit. And that is how law is decided in cases. It is part of precedent. It is the respect due a persuasive opinion by a colleague, a thoughtful colleague. And every one of these judges in every one of these cases does their level best, and Circuit splits arrive only because judges are doing their level best to interpret the law. And in this case, there were, as you point out, several Circuits, it sounds like, on both sides of this question, an honest interpretation effort of the statute before us in light of Supreme Court precedent. 

I would be happy to. The case that you are referring to involved the Sex Offender Registry and Notification Act,and, Senator, why I chose to write there was the same reason Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia wrote in the area, because in that case the law as enacted sent to the Attorney General essentially the discretion to write a law. And the legislative power is invested in this body, not in the Attorney General, a particularly odd place to delegate legislative authority, not just to some agency with expertise like with biologists or chemists, but to the chief law enforcement officer, and to send to the chief law enforcement officer the opportunity to write a criminal law. Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, again, people think they do not agree. Well, they often do, and here is an example.

Well, Senator, it is a point they made in an opinion, and I had a subsequent case raising that question, and I thought it was important to address.

I am not sure I track the question. 

I think I understand the question. I think the answer is precedent. A judge always starts where he or she finds themselves. We do not live in a vacuum. I am not writing on a blank slate as a judge. I am not, you know, a philosopher king. Iam a judge of cases. That is my job. And so you take the precedent at hand. And, Senator, that is a very important thing to me.

Senator, I can just say that has not been my experience. I have been doing this a long time, and I respect Judge Posner greatly, as I know you do. And I respect you greatly, and your view. I can just speak to my view. Maybe I am just more optimistic. You can call me naive if you want. But my experience watching Justice White, Justice Kennedy, all of the Justices of the Supreme Court who have been mentioned here today, every one of them I believe is doing his or her level best to apply the law based on the facts and circumstances.There is realm for some disagreement. There is not a single right answer to every case. I will concede you that. But that does not mean just because there is not a single foreordained answer from God in every legal dispute that judges are not trying to look at the legal materials and only the legal materials and trying to make sense of the legal materials, and that alone, and leaving the rest of the stuff aside.That has been my experience of good judges. They leave their moral convictions, their views about social utility, whatever it is, whatever they ate for breakfast, over there. They take the briefs, they take the law, they take the facts, they take the Constitution, they take the precedents, they take the original understanding, and they try to make sense of it as a judge does. And that is just not how a politician thinks, respectfully. It is not how a citizen thinks about ordering my daily affairs.

But a judge—I am sorry. 

Exactly. 

That is what I am talking. 

I am a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The one I happily enjoy now. 

I guarantee you no more, and I promise you no less.

Yes, Senator Cruz, they did. 

There is a process for amending the Constitution. 

It has, Senator, from time to time. 

No, Senator, I did not. 

Yes, Senator. 

Yes, Senator. That is how it works. 

I was. I managed to fit it in, Senator. 

No, it was—— 

Senator, it made me think about a little bit of history. It used to be back at common law that arbitration was disfavored because it was thought that everyone should go to trial. Trials were the norm, Seventh Amendment and all that. And then in about I think in 1925 Congress passed a law——

Called the Federal Arbitration Act. 

Twenty-four, okay. All right. 

All right. 

I try. 

And it made me think of that. It made me think, well, gosh, it does not have to be this way. The Federal Arbitration Act, what it did was to favor arbitration. Congress expressed a preference that people should arbitrate their disputes. They made a judgment, policy judgment in favor of arbitration because it is quicker, cheaper, easier for people. 

Yes. 

Well, I was not quite finished, but if you—it is—— 

Your time. I do not—— 

I will do the best I can. 

If Congress thinks that the courts are not applying the Federal Arbitration Act as it wishes or if it wishes to revise or eliminate the Federal Arbitration Act, I mean, 1924 is a long time ago and—— 

I can. You have shared this with me before, so I actually know who bought it.

That is okay. 

The bank, right. Yes. 

Right. 

Senator, I am a big believer in jury trials and in the Seventh Amendment. And in the Rules Committee over the last 6 years I have worked with my colleagues to try and make litigation cheaper, faster, and more accessible so that people can vindicate their jury trial rights.I have a proposal with a wonderful judge from the Ninth Circuit currently pending before the Rules Committee asking if we can actually reverse the presumption, because right now, when you file a complaint in Federal court, if you do not specify that you want your jury trial right, it goes away and you are presumed to want a bench trial. I do not understand that presumption. I think it should be——

The other way around. 

Well—— 

Well, under the Federal Arbitration Act, which is an act of this Congress, an act of lawmaking by this Congress, the first step and the key step is did the parties agree to arbitrate? And normal state contract formation principles apply there. 

And so—— 

I think it is very important, though, Senator, if you are asking me the question, I have to give you the answer. And the answer is under normal state contract formation principles, there are a number of defenses that can be raised. Unconscionability might be an argument if I were a lawyer in this case that I would want to raise in the case you are presenting. That would be an argument I would raise. 

That would be an argument if I were a lawyer I would want to raise. I do not know how it would come out. I would have to—you know, I would have to have the full judicialprocess in order to adjudicate it, but that would be an argument. If I were the lawyer, that is one I would make. Right.I would also, if I were a lawyer and worried about these things, come to this body and ask you to revisit a nearly 100-year-old law and perhaps rethink the balance between arbitration and jury trials.

I have spoken about that very issue, Senator. 

Absolutely. The Seventh Amendment—I am a big believer in the Seventh Amendment—all the amendments. And that amendment, civil jury trial, I have spoken about this a lot over the last couple days. I believe in it. I believe in juries. I believe in the civil involvement of the people in their government. I believe in the openness and transparency of a courtroom, the ability of every person to come into it, poor or rich, mighty or meek and have their cause heard. There are so many virtues to it. Transparency is one of them, absolutely.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Senator, I am grateful for the question, but that is one I am going to have to respectfully decline to answer out of respect for the separation of powers. I just do not think it is appropriate for an Article III judge to be trying to tell this body how to do its business. I just do not. Of course, I have my personal thoughts. I put them over there. I am a judge. And respectfully, I have more optimism for this country. I do. And I have more optimism for this body and for the Congress as a whole. I have seen it work. And maybe I will just leave it there.

The Constitution is a law. Like any other law, it is our foundational law, and it was drafted to last maybe unlike certain other pieces of legislation that this body might think outdated and wish to update. That is its prerogative. The Constitution was designed to last and it was a brilliant, brilliant document. And the Founders really were amazing. If you ever go to Philadelphia, you have got to go to Independence Hall and the Constitutional Center there and see how it happened. And it is inspiring.And part of the wisdom of the document is the recognition, the humility that even the Founders, brilliant as they were, could not anticipate what might happen 100 years, 200 years—we might hope a lot longer than that—down the line. And so they recognized that, ultimately, it is about we the people. The people are sovereign to this country, not a king, not a class. And if the people wish to change their Constitution, there is a provision. There is a way to do that. It is a government by the people and for the people. And that is the amendment process in a nutshell, Senator.

I am not going to—it is not categorically improper. There are some circumstances when it is not just proper but necessary. You are interpreting a contract with the choice-oflaw provision that may adopt a foreign law. That is an appropriate time to look at any choice-of-law provision by any party in any contract. Treaties sometimes require you to look at international law by their terms.But if we are talking about interpreting the Constitution of the United States, we have our own tradition and our own history, and I do not know why we would look to the experience of other countries rather than to our own when everybody else looks to us. For all the imperfections of our rule of law, it is still the shining example in the world.That is not to say we should sweep our problems under the rug or pretend that we have solved all of the problems in our culture, in our society, in our civic discourse, but it is to say that we have our history and our Constitution, and it is by we the people.And so, as a general matter, Senator, I would say it is improper to look abroad when interpreting the Constitution as a general matter.

Senator, independent agencies are in the executive branch, and there is a case called Humphrey’s Executor that was decided in the 1930s that permits independent agencies to be created. By an independent agency we mean that it is headed by usually a group of individuals who are removable only for cause as opposed to at will.

I think that term means many things to many people, Senator, and I do not wish to get involved in politics. I have spoken as to how I see our Constitution and the brilliance of it and the reverence I hold for it. And I think I will just leave it there, with your permission.

The Declaration of Independence is an amazing document, right? These are men who—as Benjamin Franklin said, we either hang together or we hang separately. When they put their name to that document, it was a death warrant if they failed. And that is why John Hancock is now synonymous with a signa-ture. No one remembers who John Hancock was, but they know that is a signature because he wrote his name so bigly—big and boldly.

Bigly. [Laughter.] 

You embarrassed me in front of my nephew and he loves it. [Laughter.] 

John Hancock, right, the signature, that was his death warrant, but he did not want the king to have any ambiguity about who it was that was signing that document. And it was his death warrant. That is remarkable, a remarkable thing that the men and the women who fought for our freedom, with all apologies to my British wife. It is, however, not the law. The Declaration is not the law. It is a Declaration of Independence. The Constitution is the foundational document and the foundational law of the country, to answer your question. The Declaration I think certainly informs every American and should inform a judge in understanding the background of the Constitution and our laws. It is not a document that should be lightly discarded. 

Oh, you are. 

Not at all, not at all. 

Senator, you and I were discussing, I believe, some of those more recent cases in the line of the Fourteenth Amendment, substantive due process case law, and all I was pointing out, or trying to at any rate, was that they have a prominence that goes back quite a ways.

I agree they all grow out of the Fourteenth Amendment due process liberty component, which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include privacy in a lot of different areas.

You have Casey, you had Lawrence, you have Obergefell. All of those are, I think, in the line of cases you are talking about, Senator. Yes.

Generally, yes. 

No, Senator, and I was not even—I do not recall being that emphatic about it. 

What I said was that obviously Casey reaffirmed the right to abortion generally in Roe, and then the ques-tion is what additional work does that language do, and that remains an open question in a lot of ways, what additional work that language does.

I think that is going to be an argument that counsel will make to a court and the court will have to consider through the proper judicial process—briefing, argument, decision.

Senator, Casey is settled law in the sense that it is a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. And you also have Obergefell and Lawrence. Those are all precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, entitled to the weight of precedent, which is quite considerable, as we have discussed.

I do not know what you are referring to exactly, Senator.

Again, Senator, I am not sure that is an accurate portrayal of the book in the first instance. I think I said that an argument could be made to that effect, at most, because you had two holdings in Casey. You had one, a stare decisis or a precedentbased holding. Roe is upheld because it is precedent.

And second, there was a second argument for upholding Roe, and this is part of it, this language. So both are sufficient to the day, and sometimes as a court you ask which is binding holding. Sometimes there is not just the law of judicial precedent but a law of interpreting when we have multiple holdings. 

The Marks opinion, for example, which talks about how you pick which holding is binding in the future. So, Senator, we have a whole law which applies here. 

A whole body of case law—— 

Senator, I think it would be an injustice to Lawrence or Obergefell for me to sit here and try to characterize them in miniature. They are thoughtful, lengthy opinions that have a considerable amount of analysis unto themselves. I would just say they are what they are. They are precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, and they——

Senator, they are precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, due all the weight of a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. I have written a book about how much weight that is, with 12 judges from around the country, appointed by Presidents of both parties. Justice Breyer was kind enough to write a forward. And it presents the mainstream view, the consensus view. Think about it, 12 Circuit Judges agreeing on 800 pages.

I would be happy if I could get 20 of you to agree.[Laughter.] 

Senator, every precedent is subject to a presumption that it stays, right? Francis Bacon called precedent the anchor of the law. Alexander Hamilton said that judges, because we are life tenured, need to be bound down by strict rules and precedents. 

There are a number of factors, and you have named a few of them, and they are all outlined in the book, among other places, and the Supreme Court precedents. 

Senator, that is the law of the Supreme Court. And you are right, I clerked for both men. I admire both men greatly. Both taught me an awful lot, and I a not here and I will not say a bad word about either one of those gentlemen.

Senator, that is a dissent. It is not the controlling law——

Of the Supreme Court. 

I am sure it does, but it is a dissent. And, Senator, with respect to Justice White, I am not here to spend an undue amount of time defending him. But we all, everyone—I know you indicated that you disagree with him; that is fine. Every one of us makes mistakes at some point in time. I do not think—— 

Senator, the Supreme Court has held that. Justice Kennedy held that. As you pointed out, you read the language, that is the binding law of the Supreme Court of the United States. And, Senator, I revere both men, both men greatly. 

Senator, I am sorry to interrupt you, but that is not correct. 

If you took away from my discussion that I do not consider Justice Kennedy a judicial hero, then I am sorry because I thought I made that very clear in my opening remarks before this body. And if I did not, I want to make it real clear right now, all right?

That I am immensely grateful—Senator, I cannot let that pass. I am sorry. 

I am glad, I am glad. I do not want the record of this Committee to go down in history as anything less than holding him in great admiration. That is very important to me, Senator. 

Very important to me. 

Senator, Justice Scalia had his views, and he expressed them in his dissent. They are his views. The law of the land is the holding of the Supreme Court in Obergefell. 

Senator, we discussed that article yesterday. I am happy to do it again. I was pointing out there, I think, two things, and a third. The first I was pointing out was that there are important civil rights issues that courts have to be available for, and that the courts are open to all persons. One of the beauties of our courts is that they can vindicate civil rights for minorities. 

It is a non-majoritarian institution. 

I do not mean to denigrate anyone’s views, Senator. This was before I was a judge. And the second point I made was that there are some comparative disadvantages to resolving policy matters for courts. One of the disadvantages comparatively is that judges are not well-equipped to decide policy matters. Wehave four evanescent law clerks that come to us for a year out of law school. Great policymakers they are not, with all respect to my law clerks, all right? They are wonderful legal researchers, but they are not great policymakers.

I am sure there are, Senator, yes. 

Reliance interests are, as you point out, Senator, an important factor in any consideration of precedent, absolutely. 

Senator, I have declined to make any promises, hints, or previews in how I would resolve any case. 

And I am going to continue that here. 

And I have already said yes. 

Senator, a lot of that was quotes from other cases, as I recall.

All right. 

And just so we are dead accurate here, I think those are quotes from the U.S. Supreme Court. 

All right. I think that is not an insignificant fact to note, Senator. 

All right. In that case, the question was whether there is a substantive due process right to pursue not a privacy interest but a lawsuit, a tort-type lawsuit against a police officer for his conduct. We have precedent in the Tenth Circuit saying indeed there is. And in that case, the majority opinion that I wrote for the court, I upheld the right of the family to pursue the police officer for damages under the United States Constitution. 

Yes, Senator. 

It is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. That is a weighty thing, Senator. 

It does, Senator. 

Senator, we have just discussed this with Senator Sasse. There are instances when foreign law may be appropriately cited. For example, in contract disputes between private parties, sometimes they will have a choice of law provision where they have contracted for the application of a particular state’s law, or maybe even a particular nation’s law. In interpreting the United States Constitution, it is generally not useful for courts to be looking at foreign law. We have our own traditions that are, frankly, the envy of the world, if we want to talk about American exceptionalism. It does not require us to look very far to find our own precedents and our own history that are more germane usually, Senator.

Sure. The Yellow Bear case involved a Native American who had murdered his daughter, 3 years old, and was in Federal prison, and was denied access to an existing sweat lodge in the prison. The prison had various reasons why it said it was unable to provide access to the sweat lodge for Mr. Yellow Bear. We applied the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was a claim brought. There was no question about the sincerity of the man’s religious beliefs, no question that he found solace in his faith after he had done what he had done.And then the question becomes, if it was a sincerely held religious belief, was it a substantial burden. And that box we checked too, because the prison denied him any access to the sweat lodge.So once you do those two things, the case then shifts to the Government, as it does in any RFRA case, any Religious Freedom Restoration case, regardless of who is bringing it, no matter how unpopular, the least amongst us. The government has to have a compelling interest, and it has to show that its compelling interest was executed in the most narrowly tailored way possible.And here, the Government just could not come up with a good reason why it could not provide Mr. Yellow Bear with any access to the sweat lodge. It talked about the difficulty of moving him because he was an unpopular prisoner and potentially subject to violence by other prisoners. But the evidence showed they were able to move him for medical reasons, and able to move him to the cafeteria, for example, and back and forth. It could not show that it was much more, if any, of a burden financially or otherwise on the personnel of the prison to also make the sweat lodge available at least sometimes.And so our court held that there was a violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in that case, just as we would in any other.

Senator, in the first two cases you are dealing with the question of an unreasonable search and seizure and what is a search. In the Jones case, is it a search to attach a GPS tracking device onto a car? If it is a search, perhaps the Government will need a warrant to do that. If it is not a search, it can just do it willy nilly.So you have to ask yourself, well, what is a search? Is that a search? And to do that, the Court went back and looked at the law of trespass as it was at the time of the founding and concluded that would be what is called a trespass to chattels, a trespass on your private property, not on physical property but personal property; and that would qualify as a search or a trespass or a property right violation at the time of the founding and concluded that when we are interpreting the term an unreasonable search, what is a search for the Fourth Amendment, that the Constitution of the United States today cannot be less protective now of the people’s liberties than the common law understanding was at the time of the founding. That is the way the Court reasoned in that case, using existing legal principles to address a new technology, and that is the sort of thing judges do.

These are areas where Congress has a role too, respectfully, Senator. New technologies challenge us, all of us. And what is a reasonable search? Guidance from Congress is helpful in that regard. In fact, I think Justice Alito wrote a separate opinion in the Jones case inviting Congress’ action in this area when we are dealing with new technologies, precisely because of the challenge of trying to address vastly new circumstances, new technologies that we have not seen before.

Senator, I am sorry. I am not sure I entirely tracked the question.

That sounds like a reasonable conclusion. 

Senator, one thing I have really gotten out of this process that I did not really appreciate, I knew the advice and consent function worked between Article 1 and Article 2, and I have been asked to comment on that, and I will not, but I have learned a lot, and I appreciate the advice I have gotten, thoughtful advice on a number of issues from Senators across the spectrum. You are thoughtful people who care deeply about this country, and you care deeply about the judiciary, and I appreciate that and the input that I have received from all of you. Thank you. 

Did you get one? Did you get one in the side? 

He enjoyed physical contact in any sport activity. You may be right. You may be right about that.

Senator, I consider it a privilege to be here with you.

Yes. 

Senator, I am afraid I just have to respectfully decline to comment on that because I am afraid that could be a case or controversy, and you can see how it might be. I can understand Congress’ concern and interest in this area. I understand that. But I think the proper way to test that question is the prescribed process of legislation and litigation. 

I have done my best, Senator. 

No, Senator, no. 

No, Senator. 

My personal views, Senator, have nothing to do with my job as a judge. 

Senator, what I have committed to do is to take a look at the law, talk to my colleagues collegially, and then make up my own mind, and I am taking into account all the advice I have gotten in this process carefully. I will carefully consider that. But, Senator, I am not going to make any promises in this process to anyone about anything other than to be the best possible judge I can be. 

Senator, it is a seminal decision of the U.S. Supreme Court interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment, maybe one of the great moments in Supreme Court history.

Sir, you can characterize it however you want. I said what I said, and I stick by what I said.

Senator, I have said it was a seminal decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that corrected a badly erroneous decision that vindicated the original understanding and the correct original meaning, rather, of the Fourteenth Amendment, and is one of the shining moments of constitutional history of the U.S. Supreme Court. That is what I have said.

Senator, I do not know what it means—I am not sure what we are arguing about here.

I am saying as a judge, it was a seminal decision that got the original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment right and corrected one of the most deeply erroneous interpretations of law in Supreme Court history, Plessy v. Ferguson, which is a dark, dark stain on our Court’s history, and it took way too long for the U.S. Supreme Court to get the Fourteenth Amendment right. It is an embarrassment in our history. That is what I have said, Senator.

Respectfully, I do not see any daylight between what I have just said and what you just quoted from the Chief.

I just do not, Senator. 

We are all on the same page on Brown v. Board of Education, Senator. 

It is a great and important decision. 

What I have said about Griswold v. Connecticut, Senator, is that it is a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court recognizing the right of married couples, in the privacy of their ownhome, to use contraceptive devices. It was decided, I believe, in 1965, though Senator Franken may wish to correct me.

Good. All right, 1965. 

And what I have said is, Senator, it is 50 years old, more than 50 years old, right? The reliance interests surrounding it are obvious and strong. It has been repeatedly reaffirmed. Those are powerful things in the law of precedent. I have also said I cannot imagine a State trying to pass a law in this area, and I have said I cannot imagine the U.S. Supreme Court taking such a law seriously. I do not know how clear I could be to you, Senator. 

Right. 

And my personal views have nothing to do with my job as a judge. 

Senator, I have consistently, not picking out Griswold or any other particular case, I have drawn a line that I think is required of a good judge to be fair and to respect the separation of powers, without respect to precedent. A precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, as we were talking with Senator Flake, they are all precedents. They all deserve respect of a judge. 

Senator, it depends upon the factors under the law of precedent, what weight you give a precedent. 

Including the age of the precedent, how often it has been reaffirmed, the reliance interests surrounding it, whether it was correctly decided, whether it is constitutional versus statutory, and a number of other things that we have discussed repeatedly. 

I have said, Senator, with this particular precedent we are talking about, it is over 50 years old, a weighty factor; that the reliance interests surrounding it are obvious and many and great. I have said that it has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. I have said that I cannot imagine a State ac-tually legislating in this area. And I have said that I cannot imagine the Supreme Court taking a challenge, someone wishing to challenge that precedent, seriously. I do not know how much more clear I could be to you, Senator, as a judge.

I have already, Senator, several times in the course of this hearing.

I think every member of the U.S. Supreme Court sitting is a very fine judge, yes.

Respectfully, Senator, I think we are splitting hairs, I really do, because I have told you quite clearly that both of those precedents are in the realm of 50 years old, that they have serious reliance interests around them, that they have been repeatedly reaffirmed. And, Senator, what I have tried to do with respect to all precedents is treat them equally in my presentation before you, because as a judge I come at them equally. In my line of work, a precedent is a heavy, weighty thing, and it deserves respect as precedent, as part of our history.

Well, let me try it this way for you, Senator. Maybe this will help. The way I look at it is I do not come at these issues fresh. It is not whether I agree or disagree with any particular precedent. That would be an act of hubris, because a precedent, once it is decided, it carries far more weight than what I personally think.

The point of a precedent—I am trying to be as helpful to you here as I can be, Senator—is that it represents collective wisdom. And to say I agree or I disagree with a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court as a judge, it is an act of hubris that to me just does not feel like a judicial function. For a judge, precedent is more important than what I think, and my agreement or my disagreement with it does not add weight to it. It is what it is. 

Seminal, important application of the principles recognized in Brown v. Board of Education, and a vindication againfor the original meaning of the Equal Protection Clause, that all of us, every single person, is equal, and that we can all choose with whom we wish to live our lives without respect to race. It is one of the great moments. We visited some dark moments in Supreme Court history, and we visited some bright moments, Senator.

That is a holding of the U.S. Supreme Court due all the way to precedent, Senator, as well.

That is what it declared, Senator. That is the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Senator, it is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. I am going to give you the same answer every time. 

Senator, I am drawing the same line that Justice Ginsburg drew, Justice O’Connor drew, Justice Souter, Justice Scalia. Many, many, many people who have sat at this confirmation table have declined to offer their personal views to this or that precedent, whether it is one side’s favorite or another side’s favorite, one side’s least favorite, the other side’s least favorite. We have gone back and forth today on precedents, which ones people like and do not like. And I understand that every citizen and every Member of the Senate have their precedents that they prefer personally and not. I understand that. I respect that. That is part of the process and our First Amendment liberties. But as a judge, as a judge, my job is to decide cases as they come to me. And if I start suggesting that I prefer or not, dislike this or that precedent, I am sending a signal, a hint, a promise, a preview, as Justice Ginsburg called it, about how I would rule in future cases where those principles from that case are going to be at issue, and all of these cases that we just discussed that are very alive with controversy, as you know, Senator, which is why you are asking about them. And for a judge to start tipping his or her hand about whether they like or dislike this or that precedent would send the wrong signal. It would send the signal to the American people that the judge’s personal views have something to do with the judge’s job. And the one thing I have tried to convey over the last 3 days is that I do not believe that is part of the judicial function, and I do not believe that is what good judges do. And I have also said, Senator, and I believe this firmly, that once a judge starts committing,promising, hinting, previewing, forecasting, agreeing or disagreeing with precedent at this confirmation table, we are in the process then of campaign promises, and we are in that process, Senator, I fear, of judges having to make commitments, tacit promises, hints, previews, as Justice Ginsburg called it, in order to become confirmed. And once we do that, I am fearful for the independence of our judiciary.

Well, Senator, I—we have discussed this quite a lot. I am happy to try to do it again. But the job of a judge is not to make law, but to interpret the law and to apply the law as best as humanly possible. And one way to do that, we start with precedent. That is where we start. We do not reinvent the wheel. And we apply the precedent we like and the precedent we do not like because our personal views have nothing to do with our job.We apply all the precedent. And if you cannot do that, well, then you are in the wrong line of work. A judge’s job is to apply precedent without respect to persons and without respect to their personal views.Then when we look at, say, an unanswered question where there is not precedent, for example, one thing a good judge will want to know is what the original understanding of that law was at the time. In the statutory context, I have talked about the fish case.

In the Constitutional context, I have used a couple of cases that I think are good examples. One is the thermal imaging case, and the other is the GPS tracking device case. Those are some of my favorite teaching cases when I go talk to young people about these issues. And the point of them all is to demonstrate two things. That when we speak about the original understanding of the law, we are protecting due process interests. We are applying the law as we could expect a reasonable citizen, person in this country to have understood it. So that when I am putting a person in prison, for example, which we do as judges. We are complicit in that process. That I know I am putting that person in prison for something that they could reasonably be charged with knowing to be improper. Not something that comes from my heart, that I made up. Not my personal views, not what I like or dislike or agree with or disagree with. But what I can say that person should have known. That is the due process/ fair notice value. And the other aspect of it is the separation of powers value that is behind this, which is, again, I can make a reasonable claim that I am declaring that the law is. A reasonable claim that I am not just doing politics. A reasonable claim that I am trying to interpret and apply rather than alter and amend the work of the people’s representatives. For after all, this is a democracy at the end of the day. It is not an oligarchy of judges. 

That is right, Senator. And that process lies with the people’s representatives for the amendment process, as we have discussed. Exactly.

I am. 

Well, Myers initially suggested that—I think it is a fair reading to say that it cast doubt on the proposition whether there could be an agency whose head would—would not be subject to removal by the President at will. And Humphrey’s Executor overturned Myers and held that was, indeed, proper. Of course, the Court has more recently also reentered this area in the Peekaboo case and indicated that while one layer of for cause removal protection is appropriate, two layers crosses a line. 

Sure. 

So Humphrey’s Executor says that you may have an agency, a multi-member agency where the head of it is removable only for cause. These are gross generalizations. 

Right. And I am not signaling my agreement or disagreement with anything. I am trying to faithfully report to you the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. 

And the Peekaboo case is a more recent case in which there were two layers of for cause removal. And the question was whether that was constitutionally permissible consistent with Article II and the statutory structure, and the Supreme Court said two layers is one too many. 

Two layers—no, two layers of for cause removal. 

Yes, yes. 

That is what the Peekaboo case basically says, yes. 

I am grateful for that, Senator. It is—Humphrey’s Executor is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and you know, I understand that some people like it and some people do not. 

Likewise, Senator. 

Senator, I appreciate the opportunity to answer that question because I have tried to make clear as I can over the last few days that I do not view my colleagues as Republican judges or Democrat judges. I view them as judges, and I believe that the courts are open to all persons.And I believe if you look at my record as a judge, as opposed to anything else, you are going to see that I have decided over 2,700 cases, that 97 percent of the time they have been unanimous, that 99 percent of the time I have been in the majority, that according to the Congressional Research Service at least, my opinions have attracted the fewest dissents of any Tenth Circuit Judge they studied.

Those are—of course. 

And I do not think it does, Senator, as I have tried to express. I do not think—when you come to the Tenth Circuit, come to my court, I think it would be deeply wrong to suggest that it depends on who won the last election what kind of justice you are going to get in my court. It is not the way it happens. And I know the men and women of the Federal judiciary, and I know how hard they work, how lonely the job is often, how much criticism they attract from all sectors, and I know that when they wake up in the morning, they do so with one thing in mind, to be a fair and independent judge for each case that comes to him or her. That is what I know. That is what I have seen. That is what I have witnessed. I know the men and women of the Federal judiciary. I know a lot of them, and I admire them. 

And I do not think it matters whether they are Republican-or Democratic-appointed judges, no. 

Senator, I appreciate the chance to talk about that article again. We have chatted about it a few times the last couple of days. And as I have tried to explain, I made a couple of points there.First was that the courts have to be open to civil rights claims. They are very important for vindicating the rights of unpopular voices, minority voices, the least amongst us. That is what courts are for.But I also made the point that sometimes social issues, problems today are not best resolved in the courts because the courts have certain limitations. One, we are just not very good at making social policy. I have got four law clerks straight out of law school. With all respect to them, I love them, but they do not know a lot, all right?You have staffs for making social policy. This is the place of the people’s representatives. We are not a democratic institution. We are life-tenured judges. I would not hire a bunch of life-tenured judges to run a country, with all respect, and call it good. There is a separation of powers.And so the point was—the other point I was trying to make there was, judges, somebody has to win and somebody has to lose. There is no room for compromise. Now one of the things this body is really good at, at its best, is compromise, right? That is what you do in legislation.

Some, there is a give and a take, a pull and a tug, right? And—— 

That is not present in litigation. So those are some of the points I was trying to make in that article. 

Senator, I thank you for the opportunity to address that. As I have indicated I think probably five or six times in the course of these hearings, the last couple of days, I was agreeing with a self-described liberal commentator on his own assessment, a Washington Post columnist. I was agreeing with his assessment.And I also have explained that, and I explained 10 years ago when I was before this body last time, that I have seen plenty of examples on both sides and really across the ideological spectrum of lawsuits that maybe perhaps better belonged in front of legislators.

Senator, with respect, I do not recall ever using the words that the courtroom is only for extraordinary cases. That does not sound like me.

I would be surprised to hear that I said that courtrooms are only for extraordinary cases. I represent a lot of people in a lot of pretty ordinary cases as a lawyer. As a judge, I resolve a lot of pretty ordinary cases in the sense that they do not make a lot of precedent or do not get a lot of attention but matter deeply to the individuals involved.

That is part of what a good judge does, part of what a lawyer does. 

Senator, they are precedents of the U.S. Supreme Court, and obviously, they have impacts.

Senator, again, I would say that there are not Republican judges or Democrat judges. There are judges. In my experience, there are fair judges appointed by Republican Presidents and Democratic-appointed judges. And people surprise you from time to time, Senator.

What do you mean by that, the ‘‘political composition’’ of the Court, Senator? I am sorry.

Well, I do think each individual Member of a court impacts a court in the sense that when I get a new colleague and an old colleague retires, there is a new dynamic with that new person. They bring with them fresh eyes from practice and maybe some new ideas, and maybe they also need some time to come up to speed in other things. Every person is different. I will acknowledge that, of course.

Senator, the Supreme Court of the United States, I was not involved in these decisions that we are discussing. I was not there.

They are precedent, and I have to follow them, and I respect them as precedent.

Precedent of all kinds has impacts, of course, and it is obviously for this body, as the lawmaking body, to assess what it thinks of the impacts of any judicial decision and to legislate appropriately. And we do our job, and respectfully, Senator, the Congress does its job. 

I understand the impulse, Senator. 

It is a human impulse. 

And as the people’s representatives——

I do not have that option, Senator. 

I am a judge. 

That is right. 

That is right. 

Senator, questions are not inappropriate. Answers would be inappropriate. I am the one who is bound by my Code of Conduct. 

I have not, Senator. 

One sentence in the statute. 

I do not know. 

And I am going to watch ‘‘Jeremiah Johnson.’’ [Laughter.] 

Senator, I understand entirely the desire of everyone to want to know the views that I might subscribe to personally and get me to make commitments about how I would rule in future cases. I understand it.

I do, but I am—and I am not saying there is any improper questions. There are only improper answers. And as a judge, as a sitting judge, I am bound by canons of ethics.

And I have tried to be as full and as open as I can possibly be, consistent with those canons. And those canons are important. They are important to me because if I did make a bunch of campaign promises here, what does that mean to the independent judiciary? What does that mean to the litigants in front of me? What does that mean for the future of this country? Those things are important to me, and there is a long line of judges who have come before me. And this is an unbroken chain, and I do not want to be the weak link. 

That is important to me. In terms of statutory interpretation, you start with the text of a statute. You look at its plain words. You consider how a reasonable person would understand those words, the affected persons at the time. You look at them. They have a fixed meaning, and you try and apply it according to its plain meaning as best as you humanly can. 

To the average—— 

To the people who have to comply. To the average person, the public understanding. 

Not a private understanding. We do not live back in Caligula’s world. Thank goodness. Caligula, who posted, as I have indicated before, his laws so high in a hand so small, nobody could read them. He knew what they were, secret law. Ours is public law. That is our system, made by the people and their representatives, a government by the people, for the people. And a judge’s job is not to become a legislator and rewrite it and fix the problems in it. 

If the words are—— 

You stop. You are done. Well, unless you have a constitutional difficulty. You are talking about a statutory interpretation case, though. So I am assuming we are just dealing with statutory interpretation, and if the words are clear, you stop. 

Senator, the Supreme Court of the United States precedent is quite plain on this very point. If the words are plain, you stop. 

Senator—— 

And I take it that way, Senator, and I am answering it not from my personal preference, but from a matter of precedent. And the Supreme Court of the United States precedent on this is plain, happily. This one I can give you. If the statute is clear, that is the end of the interpretive exercise for a court, period. Period. You are correct that if there is an ambiguity in the statute, then a court will look to other tools, canons of construction, perhaps the legislative history. There is debate over how valuable that is that we have all discussed several times in the last few days and the value and some of the issues associated with that. I respect very much the work of this body. When I am a judge, I like to get every scrap of information anybody wants to put in front of me. I read it all. I take it all seriously.There are problems we have discussed with perhaps too much reliance on legislative history, the due process issue. I think that we have discussed the Caligula problem.

The fair notice problem. 

The bicameralism and presentment issues we have discussed and separation of powers. It is not the law. But you look at everything somebody gives you. A judge does not say, ‘‘Ah, I am not going to read that brief today because I do not like the color of the brief.’’ You know, it should be a lighter shade of blue. You know, I look at all material put before me. But when the statute is plain, Senator, the precedent of the United States says to the judge stop. 

Senator, I am not sure what you mean by that, to be honest with you. 

Well, one concern I have with that enterprise is I have a very difficult time getting in the head of anyone else. And trying to get in the head of 535 of you, plus a President, well, frankly, Senator, that is often beyond me. 

Senator, I think it does suggest, hey, my house. You got to—is off limits to your troops. There is a privacy implication in there. Yes, I do. 

Yes, yes. 

Senator, you are going to have to help me out. In what context are we talking about here? State action require-ment is—the protections of the Bill of Rights are as against the State.

Against the Government. 

Yes. 

If that is what you were getting at, yes. 

They are rights as against the Government. They are protections as against the Government. 

Ah, yes. Yes. That is an interesting problem, right? Because Congress today has created a multiplicity of arrangements, and is it government or isn’t it government is actually a question that arises from time to time. And if you would like a look at what I have written in the area, I might refer you to U.S. v. Ackerman, another case where I ruled for the little guy maybe, if you like. And it had to do with whether the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is a governmental entity. And the line of cases in the Supreme Court goes all the way back to Dartmouth College case, and it is a fun read in terms of the Dartmouth College case. What qualifies as a governmental entity? The Supreme Court of the United States recently struggled with the issue in the context of Amtrak. So there are questions around this area as to what is government and what is not. Very important. Because if something qualifies as government, it has to square its corners under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, of course. So, for example, in the Ackerman case, if NCMEC is a governmental entity, it needs to comply with the Fourth Amendment. You cannot invade—cannot invade personal privacy without complying with the warrant requirement, for example. Yes, so there are very important questions as to what is and what is not a State actor. 

I can try, Senator. I find it a very hard issue. It is one every American has deep, understandable views about. It concerns the end of life. 

Oh, I am sorry. Of course. I apologize. The end of life, which we all face.

It is a problem all of us face. And it is a book in which I struggle with the end of life issues that we all face and how we as a people might consider resolving them. I wrote it before I became a judge, as a commentator with my thoughts as an individual, not as a judge. 

Yes, and I do not—I appreciate you having read some of it. I expect until about a month or two ago, it had not been exactly widely read. 

Well, I expect it will make a good doorjamb for most folks. But I conclude that there is a very important interest in being left alone at the end of life and that there is an understandable and appropriate zone of privacy there that we need to respect. And we have all experienced it when parent or grandparent wants to go home, had enough. It is time. 

Goodness, no, Senator. 

Well, it is not even my—it is an attempt to work through—— 

Yes. 

Senator, that is one worry I expressed, and that the difference between refusing treatment and killing people raises with it questions about what happens to the least amongst us. 

The vulnerable, the elderly, the disabled. And I do not profess to have the final answer here. I am not a philosopher king. But I do know that when you have a more expensive option and a cheaper option, those who cannot afford the more expensive option tend to get thrust into the cheaper option. 

And so those are some of the concerns I worked through. It is a long book. It is complicated, and I do not profess to have the right final or complete answer. I hoped, at most, to contribute to a discussion on an unanswered social question where all people, and I do think all people have a good faith interest in trying to reach some consensus socially on it. 

More or less.

Thank you, Senator. I appreciate it. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes.

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I voted that way, yes, in AM v. Holmes. 

Yes. 

I can tell you I tried my best. 

Oh gosh. Senator, over the course of my career, it would be varied at different points in time, different things. As a judge, I have done a lot of work on the Rules Committee. I have done a lot of work trying to make litigation faster and cheaper together with colleagues. I do not deserve a ton of credit. A lot of— we work by consensus on the Rules Committee. The Capital Habeas Project, again, was a collegial effort. Before that I would point as—you know, I spent time at the Department of Justice. That is not pro bono work, but it is public service. As a private lawyer, we did all sorts of different things. We would modify our fee arrangements. We would do contingent arrangements. We waived our fee arrangements. 

I would think a lot of my clients would have been considered unpopular, Senator, and notorious is in the eye of the beholder. But certainly, people who were accused of crimes, people who were involved in what might be considered scandals. Yes, Senator, without revealing any attorney-client information, yes.

Senator, my friend, Neal Katyal, who introduced me, successfully represented some of those detainees, and I have nothing but admiration for those lawyers. And the email you are referring to is not my finest moment, blowing off steam with a friend privately. The truth is I think my career is better than that.And when I have seen individuals who have needed representation as a judge, and I have got handwritten pro se filings, and I have seen something that might have merit in it, I picked up the phone and I have gotten a lawyer for that person. When I have seen lawyers who are not representing even undocumented aliens appropriately, I have done something about it.So, I would like to think that my career taken as a whole, Senator, represents my values appropriately.

Do not count on that, Senator. [Laughter.] 

Now, that would be interesting. [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. You know, I have had Senator Lee in my courtroom. 

Right. 

Senator, I have talked a lot about the Seventh Amendment over the last 3 days. Quite a lot. I am a believer in the civil jury system, and I do not know whether it is the very bulwark of liberty or the palladium of liberty. 

All right? 

They debated that—— 

Which one it was. 

But I am a big believer in it. I spent a lot of time in the trial trenches of the law. I saw the value of the jury system. And, yes, Senator I am a big believer in civil juries.

And my record proves it. 

Okay. 

Senator, someone shared that email with me this morning, and I looked at it. I do not have an independent recollection of it sitting here 11 years later, whatever it is. And to my knowledge I did not have any classified information at that time that—— 

Senator, I did as a speechwriter work from public materials. 

That is a—— 

Senator, a fair question, and to my recollection sitting here, I found out about those things when everybody else did. 

Whenever it came out publicly, Senator. I was not—— 

That is my recollection, Senator. 

Thank you. 

I am ‘‘Grouch,’’ so what the heck? [Laughter.] 

Absolutely. 

Well, Senator, I think it means what it says. The Ninth Amendment has not been much interpreted by the Supreme Court. There are different views about its effect and its meaning, and I do not doubt that there will be cases and controversies in which I would, if confirmed, and maybe even if I am not, asked to construe the meaning of that. It is one of those amendments that has not had a lot of judicial attention. We have talked about some others. 

Right. Right. 

Well, Senator Lee has written a book that includes some discussion of this as well. 

There are amendments that have been less interpreted and more interpreted. The Ninth Amendment is one of those that has been less interpreted, Senator.

Senator, we have talked a lot about Federalism in these last few days. The people in this country are sovereign, as Lincoln said. It is a government by the people, for the people. So, the people are sovereign, and it depends on what powers they have given to the State Government and to the Federal Government. And there are variations between the States as to what authorities are given and how.Nebraska, you have a unicameral legislature last time I checked. I do not know if you are the only one.

Right? But that is—the people have organized their State Government in a certain fashion, and that is for the people to do. 

So, we do have precedent in the Tenth Amendment area. I think the leading precedent might be the New York case by Justice O’Connor, which we have discussed a couple of times over the last couple of days, which makes clear that the Federal Government cannot commandeer State Government, cannot tell State government to enforce and how to enforce Federal dictates unilaterally. Now, there are some—you know, there are limits to that principle, too. A 55-mile-an-hour speed limit, which is a Federally induced requirement, has been upheld, attached to the spending authorities. There comes a question of how far Congress can go in conditioning funds before it winds up commandeering a State Government. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you.

Senator, thank you for bringing up antitrust. I cannot count myself as an expert, but I can tell you it is an area I enjoyed practicing in very much. I represented plaintiffs as well as defendants. I represented class actions as well as defended against antitrust charges. I attempted sometimes, quite unsuccessfully, to interest the Department of Justice and attacking a merger or two for a client. You know what that business is like.When I teach antitrust, I try to teach everything about antitrust. I try not to take a view. I try to teach it in the Socratic method. I try to expose my students to the roots of our antitrust decisions—Appalachian Coal, what might be classified as the biggest bad school. I tried to expose them as well to the Chicago School, which, you know, you are a graduate of the University of Chicago, and give them some sense of the economics that lie behind that.And then, I tried to expose them as well to more recent learning in this area and expose them to Professor Sunstein and his book, Nudge. So, I try not to take a view. I try to expose them to all views so they can make up their own minds. I believe that is an important function as a teacher is not to—not to be doctrinaire, but to be challenging. And I was very gratified the other day when I opened up the mail in my class, which I was teaching antitrust when all this happened, and I had said—they were very curious whether I was going to get the nomination. I said, nah, it is not going to happen, but if it does and I turn into a pumpkin, I will have a friend step in to teach the rest of the semester.In the mail the other day, I have a tie with pumpkins on it. 

Well, the real problem at the end of the day, I mean, you have a problem of lack of competition between competitors, and then of course that filters down to the consumer level. And what that yields are higher prices, and lower output, the dead weight loss to the economy, loss of production, and those are real harms. And the antitrust laws, as you know, were the original Federal regulatory regime. That was it for the national economy for a long time, and they are still vital and brilliant in their simplicity and design. 

Well, it is a great case. And as you will recall, and at least as I remember it because I do teach from it. And the year it came down, I had my students argue both sides, and half of them played the Supreme Court. They correctly predicted the outcome. It was quite impressive. As I recall, one side was arguing for a per se unlawful rule. The other side was arguing for a per se lawful rule. And the Supreme Court, through Justice Breyer, as I seem to remember, who himself is an antitrust expert, said that the rule of reason applies, in partbecause we as courts, he said, had not had a lot of experience in this area, and are very leery about making any per se rules, any bright line rules until we have some experience.That is one lesson we have learned in antitrust law over the years is to be cautious about per se rules in either direction before you have some experience, and that you can learn from the economics as you go.

Yes. 

Senator, I teach it the same way as I teach the rest of the course, which is in a very Socratic method, and to try and expose my students to all the learning that I know of that is available. And it is quite a comprehensive course. I think it is considered one of the more difficult classes at the law school, or I hope it is. Federal courts maybe even harder, I do not know. 

Oh, Senator, there is no way you are going to get me—— [Laughter.] 

Senator, I would have to go back and read what I wrote Novell to give you a fair and honest answer to that question. But I can tell you in Novell I was attempting to apply the Supreme Court’s teaching in Trinko and Aspen Skiing, which are the two refusal to deal cases, as faithfully as I could, and I can tell you that. You know, we have had some fun refusal to deal cases over the years. 

Think about it. I mean, Aspen Skiing and—— 

Right?

I appreciate that, Senator. 

Thank you. 

Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman, before this is over, I would like to have one word to everyone. I do not know when is appropriate moment before folks leave. 

Oh, gosh no. No, no, no, no. No, no. I just want to say thank you before people leave. 

Does that mean I get to leave? [Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. No, I just know some people are walking out the door, and I just want to say this for the record, and if there is anybody left watching, I still want to catch them, the American people. I have spent the last, what is it, 2 months in these buildings with you, 72 of your colleagues, and I wish the American people could see what I have seen. That is all. I think if they had seen what I have seen, they would be much bigger believers in their government than they are. It is not perfect, my branch is not perfect, but I am a believer in it. And I want to thank you, all of you, each and every one of you for doing what you do for the American people, the seriousness with which you take this project, and, Mr. Chairman, for the courtesies you have all shown me, each and every one of you. Thank you. That is what I wanted to say before folks went home. 

You deserve a lot more than you get. 

Right now, I kind of wish I did. [Laughter.] 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the record on that because I think there may be some confusion. I vindicated the 1983 claim in that case, as I have in many, many, many cases, Senator, if you want to pick them out, one here, one there. I could give you, for instance, Sutton, which we have talked about, or AM we have talked about. Those are just a couple. I could give you a whole bunch more if you want. What I wrote separately to indicate was sometimes we judges judge best when we judge least. And if there is already a State tort claim that is perfectly suitable and can achieve everything that the plaintiff wants, and, in fact, sometimes the plaintiff wants to be in State court, but gets dragged—removed, I should say—that is the legal term—to Federal court, okay? That happens not infrequently in my Circuit in 1983 cases. There is a doctrine called Parratt, a Supreme Court decision, that suggests that we should defer to State proceedings in those circumstances if they are perfectly adequate, fair, and complete remedies. And our precedent, I just pointed out, maybe we had missed Parratt, Supreme Court direction. I was bound by our precedent. I followed our precedent. But I suggested that perhaps we needed to take another look at our precedent in light of Parratt, the Supreme Court’s direction. I also emphasized, to be clear, Senator, that Parratt only allows abstention in circumstances where the State remedy is full and complete, and there is no possibility that the State court will be an inadequate forum. If you look carefully at that concurrence you will see that language there quite clearly and quite prominently, Senator. 

Senator, respectfully, I believe you are misreading what I wrote. I was not advocating limiting 1983 in any, way, shape, or form. I was suggesting that perhaps we as a court had not paid sufficient attention to the Supreme Court’s direction in Parratt. That is it. And in all of these cases, I apply our precedent and the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and the directions of Congress as faithfully as I can without any secret hidden agenda, Senator, none.And in Browder, I upheld the plaintiff’s claim. That is what I did. That is my record in that case.

Thank you for acknowledging that. 

Senator, I look to precedent. And in the Browder case, I applied the precedent of our court and of the Supreme Court of the United States. And our precedent indicated that the plaintiffs had a claim that should be vindicated, and I upheld the plaintiff’s claim. There additionally was precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court that suggested that in circumstances where the State courts are open and available, and there is no indication that there be any unfairness, that perhaps sometimes judges judge best when they judge least. Do not make more a new law than you have to. That is a principle that I think good judges bear in mind when you can. That is not to say you always write the narrowest or craft the strictest construction. You try and come up with a fair construction, but that sometimes if everything is available that might be made available to a party to be made whole, not to restrict their access in a way, shape, or form, Senator. But if everything can bedone that can be done, then perhaps we should stay our hand once in a while.

Absolutely. 

Right. 

Senator, I think you now have a have a handle on where I was coming from. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that. I think your summary right there at the end gets it. 

Likewise, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I admire Justice Scalia greatly, but his words are his words, and mine are mine. And I would ask you re-spectfully to judge me based on my credentials and my record. Justice Scalia’s legacy will live on a lot longer than mine, I am sure.

Senator, respectfully, I just do not think it is appropriate for me to comment on the work of my superiors or Justice Scalia’s words at oral argument, or any other Justice’s comment in oral argument.

And, Senator, again, I just do not think it is appropriate for me to sit here and grade a Justice’s comments at oral argument.

Judges often make—ask questions at oral argument that are hypothetical or do not represent their actual views because they are testing ideas. 

I was not there. I did not hear it. I am not going to condemn a man for arguments I have not heard, or thought carefully about, or know more about. And Justice Scalia’s legacy will live on a lot longer than mine. I am confident of that. 

Senator, if there are allegations of racism in legislation in the voting arena, there are a variety of remedies.The first, of course, is a claim under the Constitution, the equal protection clause.

Senator, I appreciate the opportunity—— 

Then I am done. 

I can do that. We are all in the same boat together. This ship, we are all in it, and either we are all going to hang together or we are going to hang separately, to mix my metaphors at this late hour.And the fact of the matter is, Senator, of course I care about this country. I care deeply about this country, and I know you do too. Thank you.

Thank you for your service, Senator. 

They are. 

They have been wonderful, as has my family. 

Thank you.

Thank you. I appreciate it. 

First and foremost, my wife, Louise, who has been with me through thick and thin. When the gruel is thin, the gruel is thick, she is there. She is my rock. I also have to thank Senator Ayotte, my sherpa. I did not know that was an official title, but it is around here. I really appreciate this opportunity. Senator Ayotte, I did not know Senator Ayotte until the day after my nomination, well, the day of my nomination, February 1st, which would have been my father’s 80th birthday. And he smiled on me that day because he gave me Senator Ayotte. And I do not know how many miles we have logged walking the halls together, meeting with you and your colleagues. She has become a fast and permanent friend. Where is Mary Elizabeth? Mary Elizabeth, who was in your Republican Senate Cloakroom and is now in the White House, she has been just so special to me. 

Oh, gosh. Is McGinley here? He is one of my former law clerks who is now a young lawyer in the White House. And I never thought I would actually have somebody carry my bag—— [Laughter.] Mr. MCGINLEY. I never thought I would carry a bag after graduating law school. Judge GORSUCH. I feel very guilty about it, because this is a very fantastic young lawyer. Watch out for McGinley. 

Oh, gosh. Who is here from the Department? Well, a whole bunch of folks. 

Patrick Bumatay, Eric Tung, one of my former law clerks, one of Judge Tymkovich’s former law clerks now in the Department of Justice have been helpful. As I know—to produce all those documents, I think they spent a lot of time reviewing and producing documents for this Committee, and I am very grateful to all of them. So there have been a lot, a lot of special people. 

I definitely had friends, you know, beat me up with questions and things like that, absolutely, Senator, sure. Of course. 

I do not know who is from Heritage. No one has come up to me and said I am from the Heritage Foundation, and I am here to help.[Laughter.] Judge GORSUCH. I have definitely leaned on my friends, Senator, and I have leaned on people from the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel’s Office, my family. 

And former, yes, yes, yes, and current clerks too. 

All right. 

Well, Justice Black used to think so. 

Right. 

Yes. 

Senator, there are always tensions in the law that we mediate. As legislators and judges and the executive branch, we all play a role in mediating tensions between competing rights. 

Senator, I would agree that, in Heller, the Court held that it protected guns in common use, for example, not every weapon or tank or ballistic missile, but guns in common use for self-defense, subject to reasonable regulation. That is my recollection sitting here of, more or less, the test the Court—— 

Senator, the law is the law. It is the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. I follow the precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court as a judge. It is the same answer I have given.

Senator, I agree that Heller is the law of the land and that it is precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and it is the obligation of judges to apply precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. 

If you have read from Heller, Heller is the law. 

Well, Senator, it is the controlling interpretation of the Second Amendment. As I indicated maybe yesterday or maybe it was today, I do not know—we have spoken about Heller so many times. But I think both the dissent and the majority opinion were very fine opinions, very thoughtful, if you want to use the term originalist, opinions, Justice Stevens in dissent, Justice Scalia in the majority, very thoughtful, detailed look at the original public meaning of the Second Amendment. They came to different conclusions, as judges sometimes do in hard cases. But I think that is a wonderful case to look at and say there are judges doing admirable work of judges who might have reached different conclusions, some of them, if they were acting as legislators and voting on their preferences rather than trying to interpret a law. 

Well, Senator, one example I remember, sitting here, in Heller, is the felon in possession statute, which I recall the Court specifically mentioned, and the dispossession of felons, which is a law that we administer regularly in the courts. 

I think that is right, sitting here, but I would want to go reread it. 

Senator, I trust your representation. 

Any judge can, as we have discussed—— 

Request a rehearing sua sponte. Yes. Correct. 

It is a great case. 

I make all of my potential law clerks read it. 

Obergefell. 

Yes, Senator. 

Senator, there are places in the Tenth Circuit where—— 

Senator, we just had a challenge to Utah’s—— 

It does. 

At the moment, to my knowledge, no. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Was what? Was the speech that she gave a fair basis on——

Senator, I have declined to offer personal opinions about cases, and I have also declined to offer personal opinions about the advice and consent function of the Senate.That is your constitutional responsibility, and this body’s, and it would be presumptuous of me as a judge at once to say I like or dislike the work of the U.S. Supreme Court as a lower court judge, and it would be presumptuous of me as a judge to say I like or dislike how this body discharges its constitutional obligations. That is really your judgment.

Senator, I have offered my legal judgment as a judge about cases. I have not offered any personal views about anything, or I have tried not to very hard.I have tried to adhere to Justice Ginsburg’s rule about no hints, no previews, no forecasts. Justice Scalia, Justice Souter, Justice O’Connor, and all the judges who come before me, I have tried not to break the chain.

Senator, Shelby County is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. I am not here to disparage the work of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Senator, what I would say is, after Shelby County, there remain some remedial mechanisms available to individuals concerned about voting rights. There is always an equal protection claim under the United States Constitution. There also is a Section 2 claim available to anyone who is concerned. It goes beyond the Constitution.And should Congress wish to legislate, the Court in Shelby County made clear that it could do so with a more updated formula for preclearance. So that remains a remedial regime possibility as well.

Thank you, Senator. 

Yes, Senator. 

Senator, I take an oath written by this Congress; it is a beautiful oath. It is to administer justice without respect to persons, to be blind to who they are, and also to do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and to administer the duties of my office, to discharge them impartially.I have tried to do that here to the best of my abilities. Not perfect. I have tried to do it for the last 10 years as a Federal judge— not perfectly, but that is what I try to do each and every day, and it is a great privilege and a great honor to be able to do it. And I am humbled, I am honored every day I come to work. And I have been humbled and honored to be here with you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, very much.
