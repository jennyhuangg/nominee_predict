NO, Senator, I would not. I just think I have to recognize the fact that, by virtue of the flow of cases through the court of appeals, as compared with the flow in the U.S. Supreme Court, that there is a much larger precentage of the caseload in the court of appeals where the resultr really, is quite clear because there is a body of precedent, or statutory directives, that we must follow, whereas in the selection process in the granting of certiorari as a discretionary matter, he Supreme Court takes an unusually difficult group of cases, very often presenting open questions as to which the answer is not often as clear as it is in the court of appeals. It is just that the case makeup is somewhat different, and the responsibility I have to recognize is such. 

I think it is an important part of our jurisprudence because it is an aspect of the development of law which tends to give certainty and predictability to the law. There have been occasions, I should frankly concede, however, Senator, where we have felt that there had been an earlier decision in our circuit which had misconstrued the statute, and we have felt obliged to overrule it. I think that happened a few times in my recollection.(39)Our practice, when that was done, was, in advance of the publication of the opinion, to circulate the proposed opinion to the entire Court so that the entire Court would have an opportunity to decide whether or not the desirability of reaching the result different from one in the past outweighed the factor of stare decisis and the consideration of certainty and predictability that we all recognize as having importance.

I think in much the same way. I think there would be times when the Court might be called upon to reexamine earlier decisions which might have been incorrectly decided. But I think it is still an important value and perhaps particularly so at the national level because there is so much more reliance on past decisions in the Federal system when it is a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court.So I would think your basic considerations are much the same, that there is important value in a system of law which is largely developed on a case-by-case basis to give appropriate respect to that which has been decided before, but yet there are occasions when the desirability of certainty and predictability is outweighed by other factors.

Yes. 

Well, Senator, the word bound is a little difficult for me to apply accurately. I would say that I certainly would weigh very carefully any decision that had already been reached by a prior Court and I would be most reluctant to depart from prior precedent without a clear showing that departure was warranted. I would feel bound, but not absolutely 100-percent bound; I think I could not, in good conscience, say that. I think there are occasions, particularly in constitutional adjudication, where it is necessary to recognize that a prior decision may have been erroneous and should be reexamined.

Well, I suppose if you assume a direct conflict between the two, the more authoritative precedent would be the more recent one because, presumably, it would have overruled the earlier one. But if you have two different situations where they are not directly in conflict, I really don't know. I don't think one can judge entirely on the basis of time. I think, if it was an opinion by a Justice such as Justice Holmes or Justice Brandeis, one would think very carefully before tending to disagree with him. If it were some Justice that had commanded less respect from the profession, one might be more willing to do so. I think it is not simply a question of age, Senator.

I think it would. But again, there is a caveat—and I want to be as straightforward as I can about it—it is my understandingthat decisions that appeared to be unanimous in prior years were not, in fact, always so. There are private papers of some of the Justices that indicate that it was more customary then than it has been in recent years for Justices to go along with the majority opinion rather than to voice dissent. So sometimes the unanimous opinion is somewhat deceptive and I think one has to be a little bit careful about overstating reliance on the factor of unanimity.But I would agree that to the extent that the decision was unanimous rather than closely divided you would tend to give more respect to it and feel more comfortable in figuring that it really did command a unanimous view. And also I think in the 5-to-4 decisions usually the countervailing argument is spelled out in some detail so you have, right on the face of the decision, reasons to consider the opposite conclusion as well.

Well, it has been my practice—and this is not a universal practice among appellate judges but it has been the topic of discussion in appellate seminars and the like—it has been my practice to dissent whenever I disagreed with the majority. That is one reason why you may find a larger number of dissents among my opinions than you do for some other judges.I know there is one school of thought that the appearance of unanimity tends to add stability and respect to the law. My own view is that it actually facilitates the fair adjudication process if everyone states his own conclusion as frankly as he can. I think it also serves the purpose to let the litigants know that they have persuaded one or two judges, and I think they are entitled to know that. They are entitled to know that their arguments were understood and they were persuasive to some even though not to all. And I found in my court, although I did dissent a great deal, that if it is done in a forthright way it does not stimulate dissension within the court.We had a very harmonious working court, notwithstanding the fact that we all felt free to dissent whenever we simply did not come to the same conclusions as the majority did. My practice is to dissent when I disagree.

I think there is that danger. I would agree, Senator. 

Well Senator, any attempt to write rules, whether they be a Constitution or in a statute or in any process of formulating rules by which we must govern ourselves, inevitably leaves areas of open questions that require study and analysis before the basic document can be applied to a specific factual situation.The more fundamental the charter is, the more it must, necessarily, contain open areas that require construction and interpretation. And to the extent that open areas remain in our Constitution, and inevitably a large number do—I must say, I don't mean to digress too much, but I have been constantly surprised in my work how many questions have not yet been decided, statutes, Constitution, all the rest—where there are open areas, the judge, I think, has the duty, really, to do two things. One, to do his best to understand what was intended in this kind of situation, and yet to realize that our society does change and to try to decide the case in a context that was not completely understood and envisioned by those who drafted the particular set of rules. So there is an open area within which the judge must work.I think he has to be guided by history, by tradition, by his best understanding of what was intended by the framers, and yet he also must understand that he is living in a different age in which some of the considerations that happen today must inevitably affect what he does.So you just do the best you can with all the factors that you put together in a particular case.

NO, Senator, I do not. In the area of policy judgments, I think the legislative branch is the branch which should make the policy judgments. Now again I think we have to be realistic and recognize the fact that when you get into these open areas, that I have mentioned, no matter how hard one tries to subordinate his own philosophy sometimes it may not be completely possible. I can say, though, in all sincerity and without the slightest hestitation, that there have been many cases on which I have sat as a court of appeals judge in which I have voted for a result which I did not personally consider to be the wisest way to handle a particular problem but which was, in my judgment, clearly the result which was required by legislation or prior decision or the Constitution. Certainly you do not have a charter of freedom to substitute your own views for the law. 

NO ; I do not. But again I have to say there are decisions which inevitably have a lawmaking character to them. I think some of that is inevitable. 

Definitely not.

Well, I must answer that in two parts, Senator, because I have some concern about the extent to which I should sit on cases which present precisely the same issue I might have ruled on as a court of appeals judge.Clearly I should not do so if I sat on a particular case, and one of the canons refers to avoiding cases where one has a fixed idea about the merits or something like that. So I am kind of uncertain about how that applies to cases raising issues similar to those on which I have sat.I am in the process of thinking that through, to be quite frank about that.But would I feel free as a Supreme Court Justice—I think it is most unlikely that I would as a Supreme Court Justice come to a different conclusion, because I would think that the reasons that persuaded me that the law required result A in the earlier case would be equally persuasive to me when I sat on the other tribunal.

If they raised arguments that I had not considered then I certainly would reappraise the issue in the light of the arguments I had failed to appreciate. But the mere fact it was another court of appeals making arguments I had already considered, I doubt if that would be particularly persuasive to me.

Well, Senator, not simply because they were prior decisions but it is usually true that after I have taken the time one takes in the court of appeals to come to a conclusion, I am pretty well convinced that is the result the law requires. I think it would be highly probable that the same process of reasoning would bring me to the same result again.But there have been occasions on which, upon further study in depth of a case, I have changed my view from what I originally thought the correct result was and I would not hesitate to do so if I was persuaded T was wrong the first time.

Senator, I think I may have said this before, and I don't mean to be repetitive, but I really think that the business of the Supreme Court—as it is the business of other courts—is to decide cases, to decide specific controversies that the Court has jurisdiction to decide pursuan t to article I I I of the Constitution. In the process of adjudication certain law is made and changes develop but the changes really, I think, are initiated by the litigants putting forth new claims some-times found to have merit and sometimes rejected. I do not think it is the function of the Court to search for issues or to regard itself as sort of commission to reform the law or something like that. There is plenty to do in simply deciding the cases that the litigants bring before the Court and that process the law does develop.

Well, Senator, again I think I would make much the same answer that I did before: that one must study the document, the language used, and the intent of the framers, and the wray in which one thinks the framers would have sized up the problem now presented. One should always subordinate his own personal views, whether they be economic, social, political, or whatever they may be, because when you are talking about your own views you are only one of millions of individuals in the country. When you are interpreting the law, perhaps you have a special skill and special training that does give you the right to pass on these questions. I have to confess that in this open area, sometimes inevitably, a man is the product of his own background and he may be somewhat influenced. But I will do my very best to subordinate those considerations because I think that is the duty of any judge.

The term "political question" is used in many different ways, Senator, and I want to be sure I answer them fairly.If the term political question is used in the judicial sense of a question which is appropriately to be resolved by another branch of the Government, such as the legislative or executive, then I would not merely hesitate, I simply would say the Court has no jurisdiction because there is a jurisdictional doctrine that the Court has no business deciding political questions in that sense.There are, however, cases that come before the Court which involve political ramifications, such as a contest for election between two candidates for the office of U.S. Senator, or something like that, which the layman would characterize as political issues. In those cases, the fact that it is political, as far as I am concerned, makes it no different from any other case. We have to face up to the question and decide the legal question, then we must do so. We decide it on the basis of law, not, of course, on political affiliation of the litigant or anything of that character which would be irrelevant.

NO. 

Well, Senator, I do not think that is a factor which affects the decisions on particular issues. As I indicated, there are times when the course of decision necessarily changes somewhat, but I do not think one could say that because of the difficulty in amending theConstitution, that it would be a proper function of the Court to assume that it had the authority to amend the document itself. I would think clearly it does not.

This happens to be an area in which I have written an opinion, and I think the law is quite clear that that would be a political question with respect to which the Court would have no jurisdiction.

I will answer that question but I should preface my answer by saying that I have not studied the issue with care. I, of course, was conscious of the issue during the last period of time. I would say my first reaction to the issue was that there would be no appeal but I really would not want that to be interpreted as a considered judgment of the issue because I have not studied it. I think it is not inappropriate for me to respond to it because I consider it so unlikely that the issue will arise during my term on the Court that I do not hesitate to respond to you as best I can.

I recall pondering that section during law school, and I recall pondering that section when I was considering a case involving the right of the defendant to demand a jury trial in a housing discrimination case. But I have not thought about all of the rnmifications of the section, and I am not quite sure how much in-depth thinking I would have to do to answer your last question.

Well, certainly Congress has such power, and, of course, whether it is wise for Congress to exercise that power is really for Congress to decide, not for me to decide. But if the power exists, I must assume there may be the occasion wThen it would be wise for it to be exercised. I think that is about the best I can do.

There was some discussion yesterday, Senator, about this, but I have no hesitation in restating as briefly as I can the substance of what I understand to be

They do differ to a degree, Senator, and I would not want you to think I had answered that completely.I think in the third area that you describe, general surveillance and the use of wiretapping, I do not think there is now statutory authority for that type of thing. I think that, of course, there is an extremely important interest in privacy that must always be evaluated before any such law enforcement technique is applied.In the second—and I am going backwards through your three areas—in the second area, crime detection and enforcement generally, I indicated yesterday my very firm belief that Congress was wise in having the checks on the use of that technique, that it has, specifically, the requirement of an approval by the Attorney General and then approval by the judges.In that connection, I made a point which I would really like to emphasize. I think that throughout the system, it is just as important to be sure that we get people we can trust in high office as it is to write laws because laws have to be administered. The confidence in the people administering the laws is something we must always value and keep in mind. We have that kind of confidence today and I think it is a very important factor in society.In the national security area, I really am not prepared to comment, Senator. I understand that somewhat different considerations are involved. I understand the Court has had one case in that area but I am not sure I can go beyond what I have said.

NO ; I was not, Senator. There was one question in which the tension between the fair trial interests of the trial procedure as opposed to the free press interests were involved. I place a very high value on the first amendment and I place a great respect for the informing function that the newspapers perform and the press generally performs and I think you would find that I would be quite sensitive to claims predicated on the first amendment. I think perhaps a general statement of my views is enough but if you want more I would be glad to enlarge on it.

I think that is correct. I think that this is a fundamental aspect of the Bill of Rights. It is one of the fundamental things that makes democracy work the way it does. I think it is of great importance. I think the fact that I have been reluctant as a Judge to communicate generally with the press should not be taken as any lack of interest or sympathy for the very important work they perform. It is just that in my particular office it is inappropriate for me to make statements about policy.

I may not have quite understood your question, Senator. I am sorry.

Well, if the law is a constitutional law and does not go beyond the limitations imposed by the first amendment, I would think the violation of the law by the press could be dealt with just as the violation of law by any other segment of society should be dealt with. I would not say they have any immunity from compliance with statutory law to the extent that statutory law is constitutional.

Yes, I can, Senator. I did not expect to address this subject in this forum, but I would like to identify what I regard as a problem which approaches crisis proportions. It is the salary situation for Federal judges. I am personally aware of many qualified people who have been asked to assume the bench, and who would have performed magnificently on the bench, who have been unwilling to do so, when they feel they have an obligation to their families, because of the dramatic disparity between what they can earn in their private practice and the relatively modest salaries that are paid to Federal judges. I really think that the quality of justice in the country is at stake when Congress does not face up to its responsibilities to pay these men what they are entitled to receive.

If he qualifies he draws his full salary. 

No. I know what my paycheck is each month. 

I also know he is paid less than State judges in most States in the Union now. 

And that line, Senator, would include men who have accumulated great wealth. It would include young men who are not now making the salary a Federal judge makes. It would not include very many qualified individuals who have families to raise and who can make double that money in private practice.

I could give you a line of men who have rejected the appointment in large metropolitan areas. I could cite to you the names of judges who were performing magnificent service who have resigned. I think it is tragic. 

Well, most of us 

I think that most of the men that you want on the bench would prefer not to be thinking primarily of retirement but rather of how they are going to perform when they are on the bench and when they are in the most productive years of their lives. 

That is not true in the seventh circuit, Senator. We have a very hardworking court. Let me just give you one statistic. I read the transcript of Justice Blackmun's hearing. I have the greatest respect, as I said yesterday, for Justice Blackmun. In the 10y2 years that he served on the eighth circuit, and that was a busy court during those years, he did less work in terms of output of opinions and sitting on cases than each of our judges in the seventh circuit has done in the 5 years that I sat on that court.And he was paid in terms of the real value of dollars a salary that was about twice as much—well, that is an inaccurate statement, but our salary has been declining each year in terms of the real value of dollars as our workload has been going up. In each of the last 3 years we have disposed of more cases than the number of new cases filed and the number that are filed is more than double what it was a few years ago.They are a hard-working group of judges. There are some judges, perhaps, who do not work hard, but that has not been my experience with the Federal judges with whom I have had contact. And I have had contact with those in other circuits as well.

I wish they would provide another judge for the northern district of Indiana. The judges there are so loaded with criminal work that the civil litigants just cannot get to trial.

It was my view as a law clerk back in 1947—and I should correct the record in one detail, I was a law clerk for only 1 year and not 2—it was my view then that the Justices worked very hard, all of the Justices on the Court. I think it is still true. I do not think it is a part-time job. I think it is a full-time job. I think that no matter what the caseload is, the men who sit there recognize the responsibility to give the best they have. I am not really sure the workload there is any harder than it is on our court.I think that the attention that has been given to the serious workload problem in the U.S. Supreme Court has tended to divert attention from other problems of equal importance to the entire judiciary, specifically the terrible strain at the court of appeals level and in many districts at the district court level. I mentioned the northern district of Indiana. In the western district of Wisconsin, Judge Itoyle, one of the very fine judges, is just swamped with work. He can hardly keep up. This is true in many places in the country.

That mav be true, but as I say, the judges that I have seen working do not fit that description. I do not really think there are very many in the Federal system. There may be some. No doubt there must be. In any system, there are bound to be some shortcomings from what we would desire. I think if you took people at random out of the line who are waiting for this job that you are talking about that might be true.

Senator, I must say that for the last 5 years the job that they are doing is quite different from what it was during the first 10 or 12 years of that 17-year period.

I agree completely, Senator. I would not depart a bit from that. I think we are all swamped with work and that is one of the tragedies of the situation today of having inadequate time to do the work the way we want to do it.

Senator, I must confess I do not recall the book review from which you are quoting but I will not fail to answer the question for that reason. I simply have no recollection of it.

I am sure I must have written it if it is there but I simply have no recollection of it whatsoever. But in any event to answer your question, I really have a feeling this is a subject on which it might be somewhat unseemly for me to speak. I would say this much, that I think generally an institution such as the Court should have a rule that normally governs its procedures but those things can sometimes be taken care of by the respect which one Justice has for another. In other words, if there were three votes to grant certiorari and one of them felt especially strongly that the case should be heard, often, as a matter of courtesy, I think another Justice might say, Well, I will cast my vote with the three in order to grant certiorari. I think there has to be a certain flexibility and informality in the administration of that kind of rule. I don't know if I could go much beyond that.

Yes I recall that. 

It would be my own view. I think it would also be Mr. Justice Rutledges' view. I have a recollection that I refer in that article to his statement that no man or group is above the law, or words to that effect, which I think I was surprised to find him use twice in the same opinion. He was known for writing long opinions. That was sort of a small example of his, perhaps, writing more than he needed to, but it was an important point worth making twice.

No; I do not. 

Very definitely. 

NO ; I was not. 

Senator, when I wrote that chapter on Mr. Justice Kutledge, I felt I could not improve upon his language at the time it was written and I could not do so now.

I think that the danger that press comment on the criminal trial would cause a due process problem primarily exists at the trial court, that is where there is the greatest danger that an unsequestered jury may be influenced by a matter outside the record. I would not think that the same danger exists in the appellate courts because judges should be able to separate out what is properly before them in the court record and what they read in the press. 

NO, I think when you are given the predicate that they feel there must be a decision within a given period of time, by hypothesis it must be done within that period of time, but I certainly think that the decision that it should be decided at a particular time, should be very carefully made. Part of Mr. Justice Eutledge's dissent in the Yamashita case was really an objection to the accelerated schedule which he did not think, and I think quite properly, justified any deviation from what otherwise would be proper procedure. 

Not since I have been on the bench, Senator. I had been a director of some companies before I assumed the judgeship. In private practice, yes, but not since I have been a judge. I provided a list of those to, I believe, the Department of Justice when I first went on the bench and I have resigned from all of them. 

With this qualification, Senator. There were some payments made to me pursuant to my separation agreement with my firm on account of services performed before I went on the bench. I have received no compensation, no extra judicial income on account of any activities since being a judge.

It was in connection with this nomination, not in connection with the prior nomination because the negotiation of our separation took place after my nomination. But all those details were provided and they had been disclosed to everyone with an interest in the matter.

That is correct. Apart from the payments made by my former law partners to me on account of services performed before I went on the bench, I have received no extrajudicial income except in the form of either dividends, for a brief period of time when I still held some stock—I have no stock now—and interest payments on some bonds that I hold and interest on a savings account. I have no business income of any kind.

NO. 

None. 

Thank you, Senator. 

I am indeed pleased, and I will, of course, also be pleased when the existing vacancy is promptly filled. 

I understand that. 

If this becomes necessary—and hopefully the explosion in the volume of cases will not continue at the same pace, it may or may not, we really can't be sure yet—but if an increase in the number of judges of the magnitude that is projected becomes necessary, and, of course, it may, 1 would think it would necessarily follow that we would have to start dividing the circuits and have a larger number of circuits and divide the larger circuits, such as the ninth and the fifth now, at least in half and gradually reduce the geographical area that they have jurisdiction over. I think a court as large as the fifth or the ninth probably does not function as effectively as one of about eight or nine judges. I have the feeling—and maybe that is just because I worked in such a court and it seems to have been an efficient judicial unit—I think you need several judges to take care of the conflict problem I discussed yesterday when someone can lean over on the side of recusing himself. But when you get too many judges you have a problem if you have en bane hearings, administrative problems, and I think it is also unfortunate in other circuits that the judges do not live in the place of holding court. I think we have an advantage by being in Chicago. I think there is an advantage derived from efficiency that way. I think that perhaps the first thing that would have to be done with a larger number of judges is to increase the number of circuits.

I would think even that is a little large, but perhaps I should defer to the judges on the fifth circuit on that. I do not think you should get larger than that certainly.

Of course, I am familiar with Judge Sprecher's opinion in that case. It did involve his interpretation and the panel's interpretation of the statute primarily. I think the power of the magistrate can be enlarged somewhat. I doubt if it can be enlarged to the extent of ruling on matters such as motions to dismiss. It seems to mewhen you are talking about the legal sufficiency of the claim, that should be a matter for the judge, but I think there are areas in the supervision of discovery and in a preliminary investigation of facts, and the presentation of tentative findings of fact, in which the magistrate could appropriately be given additional authority which would be helpful to the judge and help solve the overload problem.

I think that is right. 

Yes. I think I would generally support that. 

Yes; it does. Senator. I should, perhaps, explain that in the first paragraph, if I remember the speech, I recited the fact that T had obtained a commitment from Dean Rahl at Northwestern that what Tsaid would never be published because I was speaking in a very informal way and taking little time to prepare, but I have reread the speech because I was told vou might ask me about it, and I stand by what I said in the talk. T think it does fairlv reflect mv view.I think that there are costs to having judges reach out for issues that need not be decided to dispose of litigation before them, and the cost is greatest when it is the Federal court that does that because of the implication of the Federal decision having a nationwide impact. So, that speech does, in sort of a rough, informal way, indicate the reasons why I think judges should impose on themselves the discipline of deciding no more than is really required to adjudicate controversies.

T would have thought it was the other way around. Maybe I did not hear it correctly, that the people are made for the courts ? I would say the courts, the business of the courts is to serve the people, and, of course, our society as a whole.

I place the highest possible value on the interests protected by the First Amendment. I also place an extremely high value on the interests protected by the due process clause insofar as it guarantees fair procedure to every defendant. It is awfully hard to say in the abstract, Senator, which priority would govern in a particular case because the facts do vary from case to case. I certainly would not suggest at all that there was any constitutional provision of greater importance than the First Amendment, but I don't think that I could say that whenever there is a conflict between the First Amendment and the Fourteenth that you can count on me to rule for the First because the facts might not quite fit that formula.

I would think that is right, and I think I have recognized the values protected by the First Amendment in some First Amendment cases where my colleagues have not. I think those cases can be found and could be identified. I do not think you will have any trouble with my high regard for the values protected by that portion of the Constitution.

I think there are three parts to your question, if I may be as precise as I can.

First, there is the question of whether there is sufficient State action to warrant Federal intervention at all, the kind of Federal intervention where you would reach the merits of a particular controversy. It is in that area that I, perhaps, have written some opinions which are somewhat more restrictive than other Federal judges hare written.I have required, and there are a number of these cases, it perhaps would not be best to talk about them specifically but I think that, to the extent that you can generalize, I have felt that consistent with my philosophy of trying to keep the work of the Federal courts within manageable bounds, so that it continues to perform with a degree of excellence that I think has characterized their work in the past, there is a strong interest in placing reasonable or recognizing the existing limitations on the scope of Federal jurisdiction.So I have written a few opinions in which I have come to the conclusion that in the particular facts the State participation in the matter of which the plaintiff complained was not sufficiently direct to warrant Federal intervention, and some of those opinions are the subject of criticism by those who have suggested that I shoud not be confirmed. But once you get over the hurdle and into the area of where the Federal court does have jurisdiction, you must address the merits.Then you have pointed out wThere there ie a classification problem in the racial discrimination cases, and I understand you to be asking me if I would find a rational basis, a sufficient basis, for a classification on racial grounds. Clearly I would not. I think the law is well settled, and properly so, that a much heavier burden, perhaps almost an insurmountable burden, exists in order to justify any classification on any such factor.And now you turn to the question of sex discrimination. I think you were asking me whether the heavy burden test or the lesser burden test should apply in sex discrimination cases.

I Kn not sure, Senator. I am not sure whether the same test would apply or not. I don't think the court—the court has dodged and fenced a little bit on that question. They have made it clear, as I think I indicated yesterday m response to one question, that the classification is one that is subject to the equal protection clause, but that the standard of review may or may not be the same as it is in racial discrimination areas. And I suppose on reflection I have thought a little bit about Senator Kennedy's question. That may be something that the Equal Rights Amendment might accomplish. It might define the standard of review7, but I am not sure when one reads the amendment that it does. So I am not sure you would have a different standard after the amendment is adopted.I should say another factor that goes into the equation of whether the amendment is something that should be adopted is the extent to which the goals of the amendment can be ahcieved by statutory enactment. To the extent that they can be achieved by statute, is it really wise to go through the cumbersome process of amendment, which is (not really necessary? That is part of my uncertainty about the problem.

Yes; I do. 

Senator, I think I may have made some comment on this problem already, but the role of the court is different from the role of the Congress in addressing that area of concern because presumably, on the hypothesis we are talking about, there has been afinding of violation and there has been proof that discrimination existed and was supported by State action that made the matter appropriate for Federal review. That having been established by the record, what should the judge do about it? Well, there the trial judge may appropriately go beyond merely a colorblind remedy and require in certain circumstances affirmative action to redress the past injustice, but the extent of such affirmative action would always be a function of, and be related to, the kind of factual situation disclosed by the particular case.So I could not fairly say that in every case affirmative action would be an appropriate remedy, nor could I fairly say that it would never be appropriate. It really has to be done on a case by case basis because there is a wide range of variation in cases of this kind.

Well, I think it is a power which should be exercised rarely. I think the difficulty in the amending process indicates that the authors of our Constitution did not expect it to be used frequently, on casual or relatively unimportant matters, and I would think generally that to the extent that goals can be achieved by other means without the costs that are associated with the laborious amending process that is desirable, and I would wonder if something as specific, say, as the 18th amendment, was wise when it could have, perhaps, been handled by legislation, at least as it is now construed I wonder if it was appropriate for amendment.But I certainly would not say that there should be no tampering with the Constitution. It has to be changed from time to time, otherwise there would be no need for an amending power, so I would say that I would regard it as an important power to be sparingly used.

That is true, Senator, but I am not sure it is fair to characterize changes in the developing body of law as amendments to the Constitution. They, perhaps, have somewhat of that effect.

Yes. 

Well, Senator, I would think that one who relies on national security as a justification for action that otherwise would be impermissible bears a very heavy burden, but I think that we must face the fact that even in the area to which we attach the highest priority, namely, the first amendment area, there are occasions when restrictions are justified by reasons of national security, and I have in mind specifically the question of the prohibition of publications about troop movements and ships and the like, which even in Near v. Minnesota was recognized as exceptions to the absolute right of the press to publish what it would.So, not trying to be evasive, you do have to consider the particular case; but I would certainly agree that the burden is on the Government when it seeks to justify for such a reason to show that this is a valid reason and to be prepared to make such a demonstration.

Well, there is no question that there are privacy interests we must always keep in mind in any of these problems, whether they be national security or even less extreme matters such as simple detection of crime.

I would think so, and I would think, again, perhaps when a particular case comes up I might find that I have spoken somewhat loosely, without sufficient reflection, but my general reaction would be that A, it bears a heavy burden, and B, it bears some burden of factual presentation to enable a factfinder to know that this is not merely a formula of words that is being used to justify something other than a real national security interest.

Senator, during the recess I scanned it. I had previously been told about the substance of these charges. I think I am sufficiently familiar to answer anything that you wish to inquire about and I can say the same about the press release. I am prepared to answer any question you care to pose about either of those.

It is sort of ironic because I am inclined to think that the performance of the work of that Special Commission is thereal reason why the course of events developed to bring me here today. "That happened shortly before my original appointment, and I think it was because of a good deal of public attention that my name came to the attention of the people who were trying to find people, who might fill a vacancy.But as I understand the substance of Mr. Martin-Trigona's charges, he says that Mr. Torshen, who was my assistant counsel, told him in a conversation that the commission—and specifically I suppose myself as general counsel—had information that two justices of the Illinois Supreme Court were guilty of misconduct which would have justified their removal, and that we had such information and we withheld it from the public and took no action with respect to it. This is simply not true.We investigated charges of impropriety with respect to a particular case. People v. Isaacs, and as a result of very hard work in a very short period of time, with a very dedicated staff, uncovered factual information which justified a report by this special commission of five eminent lawyers of the city of Chicago, not all of the city of •Chicago, but the bar of Illinois, it was not simply Chicago lawyers.

There is no basis whatsoever for a charge that the Commission or any of its staff, or I am sure myself either, failed in the discharge of the duties assigned to us. I think that the Commission, and I say this as a member of a team, did a magnificent job which I regard as one of the principal important professional achievements of my life.Secondly, Mr. Martin-Trigona has released a press release which in substance says I have not made a full disclosure of my financial situation.I am reminded that in addition to the letter of denial by Mr. Torshen, there is also a letter of denial by Mr. Pitts and by Mr. Greenberg, two letters of denial, one by each, the Cochairman of the Commission, who also substantiated what Mr. Torshen says.[Affidavits by Mr. Pitts, Mr. Greenberg, and Mr. Torshen appear at pages 194,197, and 198.]Judge STEVENS. The press release, as I understand it, says I have not made an adequate disclosure of my financial circumstances, specifically, I have not disclosed the assets of my family and that I may have secret interests in some properties held in trust by others. I have no assets other than those which I have disclosed to the committee.Our disclosure includes everything which I own. everything which my wife owns, and everything which I own as the trustee for the benefit of my two young daughters, with one inadvertent exception. Each of them has a savings account of approximately $500 which we inadvertently overlooked.The charge in the affidavit also suffs-ests that I have some business connections with Mr. Keane who was identified in questions yesterday.who is a litigant in a matter with respect to which I disqualified myself. I was called last night by Senator Hruska who asked me if I could tell him what I knew about, I think it was the MC or NC company, something like that. I told him I did not recognize the name, which was true. I had no knowledge of it whatsoever.Upon inquiry I found that the NC entity, whatever more precisely it is, was represented by my former partner, Edward Rothschild, who also was a nominee for certain members of his family in that business venture. Mr. Rothschild advises me that Mr. Keane had no interest whatsoever in that particular venture. I know I had no interest in it whatsoever, neither did any member of my family, nor to the best of my knowledge, anyone with whom I had any association whatsoever, other than Mr. Rothschild, and as I say, he was associated with the matter in a professional capacity, and also as he advises me, was a nominee for a minority interest which I understand were those of his children. But in any event, I think this is a matter that dates back to 1964, sometime like that. I certainly had no occasion at that time to have a nominee serve for me in any capacity.It is a particularly sensitive area because the investigation that T ran emphasized certain judicial conduct where nominees did hold interest for judges and I am conscious of the fact that that is a method of concealment that has been used by others in the past. It has never been used by me and it never will be used by me.

I am not, nor is he my nominee, and I should also say that, as you have observed, Senator, and I appreciate your comment, it is somewhat embarrassing to have to acknowledge that one's net worth is as small as it is. But I would like to point out that that is my net worth today. It is not my net worth when I went on the bench, and I did not have significant long-term advance notice of the possibility 1 might go on the bench. I think had I known 3 or 4 years in advance that I would be going on the bench and had time to make the adjustment, perhaps the figure would be different.And as I say, if questions occur to any members of the committee either now or in the future about this matter, I have no reluctance whatsoever to discuss it with you. I might say also for the record I do not intend to respond to inquiries from the press about this or any similar subject, although I will respond to the Senators at any time, even subsequent to the close of the hearings, if you feel there is any reason to question the thoroughness of our disclosure.

AS a general proposition, I think the doctrine has been pretty universally adhered to by the Supreme Court that it is our duty to avoid decision on a constitutional ground if there is a sufficient basis for deciding the case without reaching the constituitonal ground. I think you may have in mind the fact that in recent years the court appears to have expanded somewhat the doctrine of mootness and restricted somewhat the doctrine of standing and has perhaps reached fewer constitutional issues than come thought they could appropriately have done on the basis of past history. So there seems to be a little area of narrowing the field of adjudication by these procedural techniques. I would not want to comment on any specific decision but I do recognize that there is some change that appears to be going on and it is in the way of perhaps reaching even fewer constitutional issues than the Court has in times in the past. 

T really do not know how to answer that. I don't like to think of it in terms of a trend. I must confess there were some of those decisions, and I would not want to name them, but there were some in which I would have thought the Court would not have found mootness. "Well, I think I might mention one specifically. I was surprised at the law school reverse discrimination case. I would have thought the court would have reached that issue on the basis of the facts. I think it is kind of hard to generalize on a trend but I think these are rather difficult technical questions sometimes and there is room for argument on both sides.

That is one of those factors, Senator, that perhaps unconsciously is always applying some built-in pressure against a judge. We are all concerned, and it is true and I think we have to be frank about it, we are all concerned about the overload problem. It affects us every day of our working lives and it inevitably may exert an unconscious pressure against us.I think if one can disassociate oneself from that problem, one should, because really the issue should be addressed on the merits apart from those factors that affect our working conditions. So I do not think it is a proper factor, but I do not think we can deny the fact that it may have some input into the decisional process.

I think it makes some difference but not very much. That would be my impression because the Court seems to exercise a somewhat different form of discretion in processing appeals as of right. Instead of denying certiorari, it may summarily affirm or dismiss for want of substantial Federal question with maybe a one-line opinion or a citation of a case or something like that.In a strict interpretation of the law, such action will have precedential effect, whereas the denial of certiorari does not. So there is a legal difference between the two.My tentative conclusion, just based on watching the way the court works, is that there probably is not a very significant difference between the two. I think it would really be more orderly in the long run if the jurisdiction were entirely discretionary. I think the appeals as of right really do not serve any important interest.

The principal factor would be the importance of the issue presented by the case to the country at large. I would think that is the major factor, and of course there one has to evaluate importance by whatever standards he can.

We talked about that very briefly this morning and I pointed out what I am sure you are well aware of, Senator, that the term political question is used in two different senses: one, the jurisdictional sense and the other, the more or less popular sense. I think that really ever since Baiter v. Carr the political question objection to Federal jurisdiction has been narrowed.I mean the court has taken more cases that would previously have been considered political questions. But it is still very definitely a viable doctrine and there are still areas within our framework of Government where it is quite clear from the Constitution that final decision of the matter was intended to be placed in another branch of Government, other than the judiciary.A simple example is the declaration of war. Clearly the Court does not declare war and there are matters that are clearly committed to other political departments, and then the judiciary should not, it has no jurisdiction to participate.Now the second phase of it is that there are controversies that have political overtones and ramifications but nevertheless represent justicable issues and in those areas the court has the responsibility to act just as it does with respect to other litigation.

Well, I hope the first amendment applies to the Supreme Court as well as to other branches of Government. I would certainly not feel there was any, that a Justice should have any inhibition about stating frankly to a colleague how he analyzes an issue.It happens to be the practice in our court, as a matter of custom, and I think personal preference of all the judges, that we do not discuss cases in advance of argument. We find that we like to come with free, independent appraisals of the issue and we first have an opportunity to discuss it really with counsel in oral argument and then after in our conference. We think that is a healthy approach.I really do not know what the tradition is on discussing the merits within the Supreme Court, but I do not see anything inappropriate about discussions by less than the entire membership of the Court on a particular matter.

Senator, I spoke very briefly to that subject this morning.

Well, let me be sure, because I do not want you to read the record and feel that it is incomplete. It is not that extensive.My own personal philosophy, which is not shared by all judges, is that if I do not agree with the result of the majority, I dissent, even if it may be a very brief dissent, or if I find something in the reasoning that is unacceptable, I try to write a brief concurrence. I think the litigants are entitled to know how the judges appraised the arguments and to be sure that all of them understood the arguments that wTere presented.And I think preserving in the record of the opinion of the case itself the fact that there was a diverse point of view, of points expressed in the Court, may make a record that will help at a future date when the same issue may be again presented for reexamination.So I think dissenting opinions do perform an appropriate and important function in the entire process.

Let me state it precisely. I have had no business transactions with Tom Keane whatsoever. As I explained a day or two ago, I was retained by his firm in two matters. But these were not as a principal or investor, these were a matter of litigation. I was not a participant in any way, shape, or form in the entity, the name of which I do not recall at the moment, that was formed back in 1964, as I understand it. And I am advised by Mr. Rothschild that neither was .Mr. Keane.Mr. Rothschild handled the legal work for this particular investment group and, as I understand it, on the basis of what he told me this morning, he was also a participant to the extent of a very small percentage as a nominee for his children.He was not a nominee for me, nor I for him. 

I do not like the word other, Senator, there was none. 

I have no family business. 

NO.

I think not. As I say, the entity about which questions were raised was one for which he performed legal services and I think an assumption was made that Tom Keane was an investor in the entity.I have no knowledge one way or another, but Mr. Rothschild assures me that Tom Keane had no interest in the venture whatsoever.

Today, he told me that, that is correct. 

I sat in the case entitled Cousins v. Wigoda which did involve a redistricting plan of the city of Chicago, with respect to which Tom Keane is one of the leading members of the council, he was a witness, and was an important participant in the enactment of the ordinance that gave rise to the litigation. I do not recall whether he was a party to the case or not. And frankly, the thought of disqualifying myself on that case never—had never occurred to me on the basis of the quite remote connection I had liad with Mr. Keane.I looked at it much more closely in the case in which he was a defendant in a criminal proceeding and as I think I also mentioned in my answer yesterday, it was more in the category of the notorious criminal trial in which there really is a compelling interest of avoiding even the slightest suggestion of any appearance of impropriety, and I simply did not think of the problem when the Cousins case was before the court.

I should think not, Senator. It is difficult to conceive of a situation in which a prior opinion construing something other than the amendment before us would be relevant on the construction of an amendment which was not even part of a law in the earlier case.I suppose sometimes the thinking you do about an issue carries over when you have to analyze a similar issue, but certainly you must approach it with a fresh mind and I am sure I would do so.

Thank you. Senator. 

Senator, I read Furman v. Georgia, which I recall is a case in which each of the nine Justices wrote a separate opinion, in the summer after the decision was announced, and the opinions are, I think, more than a hundred pages in length if my memory serves me right. I have not read the case since the summer after it was announced.I know that a consensus of the five Justices that comprised the majority was that the capital punishment in the particular cases before the Court should not be carried out. JSTow I think it would be most unwise for me to try to extrapolate from these separate opinions on the basis of a 5-year-old recollection, on what I think the precise holding of the case is.I think it would be given attention and importance which would be highly unwarranted.

Senator, as I recall the interpretation of the eighth amendment, there are basically two kinds of arguments that are made in support of a claim that punishment is cruel and unusual.One is that the particular punishment is so disproportionate to the particular offense, such as a death sentence for possession of marihuana, that it might seem to be disproportionate and one might apply such an argument.On the other hand, another kind of argument is that in absolute terms, certain kinds of punishment, such as, I think whipping is an example that is given, are considered so barbaric by present-day standards that they would be considered cruel and unusual within the meaning of the amendment.And I think there is certainly some truth to the notion that one has to consider both the social conditions at the time the amendment was adopted or the intent of the framers and the background in which a particular punishment is being given out today. That is about as much as I can say.

Yes. I think even in the first amendment area, there is some balancing that must be done because cases are not, do not arise in neat pigeonholes. There is a question as to whether what is regulated is merely the time and p]ace of speaking as opposed to the content of speaking. And there is quite a different approach depending upon what kind of issue is raised.You have to look both at the interest of the speaker and the public interest in having the communication become a part of the publicdomain. There are various factors and I think you will find in my opinions some recognition of both sides of the public interest in communication. I think you might find that in some of the cases involving the rights of prisoners for example.

Yes; I would say that a most important factor, I would not want to limit myself to this as a formula for deciding all first amendment cases, but a significantly important factor—and I guess that is pretty redundant—is the question of whether there really is communication involved and whether it is communication as opposed to conduct or overt conduct.We find on a scale which sometimes involves gray areas, between communication and conduct, where it falls. If it is within the area of communication, then perhaps you get to the question of whether there is any element of appropriate regulations in the area of time, place or manner of speaking, because, of course, the Court many times has said that this is a permissible area of control. Certainly I imagine you might resent it if someone strode into this room and started making a speech about baseball or something of that nature. So there are restrictions that must apply.But the paramount consideration is, I think, that the judge's evaluation of the right to speak and the right to communicate should be divorced entirely from his own appraisal of the substance of what is said. It is not for him to either sympathize or be unsympathetic to the message which is transmitted. But rather he should be concerned with the channels of communication so that, be it one which he detests or supports, it is able to find itself in the free marketplace of ideas.

Well, again, of course, I have to avoid any comment about the particular case that has been in the press lately. But very simply, the two rights at stake are, on the one hand, the interests of society in knowing what is happening in a public trial and, on the other hand, the interest in procedural fairness to both litigants, the State which is bringing the proceeding and the defendant which must receive a fair trial. So there is a very difficult clash of interests in these cases but those are the easily identified conflicting interests in this area.

Yes. I might say something for the record here because I have received some support on a basis that is not entirely warranted. It has been said that I have never been reversed.I was reversed in a case called Gertz v. Welch which involved the extent of protection to the press afforded by the so-called New York Times rule, and on the basis of the decisions up to that point, we concluded that a claim of libel was foreclosed by the first amendment protection. The Supreme Court reversed this, and I think changed the law rather substantially in a direction of narrowing the first63-774 O—75 6amendment protection from libel and slander liability that prevailed heretofore.I do not know if one case makes a trend, but it was a recent case that goes in the direction I have described.

Yes; I would say that that decision seems to have led to additional prosecutions and therefore those with prosecutorial responsibility have apparently concluded that the decision does make it easier. I think, again, I have not had an obscenity case since those were decided. So, again, what I say is based simply on reading the options when they came out. But unquestionably, they represent some change in the law and some lessening of first amendment protection in the obscenity areu.Of course, there are pros and cons involving the desirability of extending that protection in that particular area.Sentator TUNNEY. What about the doctrine of substantial overbreadth which makes attacks on the face of a statute more difficult?Judge STEVENS. That doctrine is sometimes misunderstood as having application to all kinds of broad statutes. I think, properly interpreted, the doctrine applies only to statutes which are overly board in their interference with the right to communicate, in other words, in the First Amendment area. I think that sometimes the doctrine is misapplied in the areas other than the First Amendment area.And of course, the underlying rationale of the doctrine is that the great interest in fostering free speech and not having statutory deterrents to speech justifies departure from the traditional rule that decisions will only be made adjudicating the rights and interests of the particular litigant before the court.And in the over-breadth area, because of the high value placed on the First Amendment, the Court has, on occasion, held invalid statutes which are over-broad in the sense that they chill the exercise of free speech. I think the Court has been rather consistent in this area although there is some confusion in the opinions between that doctrine and the doctrine of vagueness, as applied in the Fourteenth Amendment area. I think it is really a separate problem.

Let me try to state it again. The Senator was asking me, if I recall correctly, about the desirability of legislation limiting the right of the press to comment on trials, and I suggested that, to take the problem by separate parts, perhaps we should first address the problem of the appropriate extent of control which might be imposed by court rule, or by professional disciplinary rules, on the kind of comment that either the prosecutor or the defendant's attorney migh make about the subject matter of the trial and try to let the facts find their way into the record in an admissable way and an orderly way. And then the press would have its first opportunity to comment after the record was made.I think that the particular undesirable thing that happens is that, on the basis of partial information and hearsay and secondhand suggestions, the press, in effect, makes statements, not intending to do so, which seriously hamper the ability of the defendant to receive a fair trial because the public gets an impression of what the facts are before all the evidence is heard. And that is what we are trying to avoid.I said that I thought that if it is approached that way, it perhaps is a matter which the courts and we drafters of court rules and disciplinary rules should address in the first instance. And then maybe there wTould be something left that Congress needs to address. But I sort of think this is one that we have to tackle first. '

NO. The sort of thing I was thinking about would be a representative of the enforcement agency making a press release to the effect that we have obtained a confession and we are sure the man is guilty, or a premature announcement of a confession before the voluntariness of the confession has been determined in the adversary proceeding, comments on the evidence when it is not sure the evidence is admissible or reliable, and things of that character.I did not have in mind the possibility of impoundment of public records. There are some times in the juvenile area where that may be appropriate. There may be areas where the damage by public comment on a young man is unfortunate, and that weighs the interest of a public debate.I would not want to go beyond that, but I would not want to foreclose entirely the possibility of some area where we might want to put some limit on what we put in the public domain.'

Senator, of course I should not try to address the merits of a bill I have not studied, but I think I could say this, that I have had occasion to write at least one opinion in what was a rather severe attempt by the prosecutor to make use of information in an arrest, or maybe he was trying to use a misdemeanor, for impeachment purposes which we thought was clearly improper, and I have also written an opinion on the subject to the extent to which a prior conviction is properly used for impeachment purposes when the defendent elects to testify in his own behalf, and we have expressed concern about the use of convictions.Now this is, of course, even more severe than arrests which are, I believe more than 10 years old is the time suggested in the Federal rules, basically on the theory that, I suppose, underlies your legislation, that once a man has paid his debt to society, if he has a blameless record thereafter, he is entitled like everyone else to the presumption of innocence.So I think you could find something that is somewhat sympathetic to the thrust of what you are suggesting.

Yes. And I have to say that, of course, in those opinions, there is no countervailing first amendment problem that I recognize you are sympathetic to too. 

I am familiar with that problem. [Laughter.] 

I take it you are asking whether there should be something akin to the Miranda warnings as a precondition to a consent to a search, or something of that kind? 

Well, sometimes it is hard to evaluate with precision because sometimes things are taken as a trend which are merely the arresting of a prior trend. In other words, a refusal to extend the law even further than it has been extended in the past is sometimes interpreted as a reversal and that really is not necessarily the case.For example, the admissibility in a grand jury proceeding of illegally seized evidence, it had simply not been passed upon before the Calandra case, I think was the name of it, and when the Court addressed that, it expressed concern with the importance of a broad investigory power for the grand jury and said that that interest was sufficient to overbalance the fourth amendment interests.I do not know whether I would say that represents a trend or really a refusal to extend the law further.Similarly, in the right to counsel area, the Court—this is not really responsive so I should not go into that.

The closest one that I can recall was a case involving the execution of a search warrant which pursuant to a statute authorized entry into a domicile if entry had been refused. The officers knocked on the door, and a few seconds later, busted it down, and entered a home and conducted a search.We found that the waiting of an interval of 2 or 3 seconds did not constitute consent. I think that is perhaps about as close as I have written on the precise point.

Well, yes, I think it has come under attack and I think the attacks are increasing. I think it is true that the public sometimes has difficulty understanding why evidence which tends to establish guilt in a fairly convincing way must be excluded from a trial, it is somewhat inconsistent with the truth determining function of the trial, but of course the countervailing value at stake is the great interest in the privacy of the citizen and the concern that, unless the exclusionary rule is enforced, there may not be an adequate deterrent to police conduct which none of us would approve. So again there is tension here. I am not sure I should go beyond that. I have never had to address the question of whether there should be an exclusionary rule and this perhaps is an example of a difference between the job of a court of appeals judge and a Supreme Court Justice. It is part of the framework of the law which I accept, as the data with which I work, that we have such a rule in the law now. It is part of what I work with every day.Now if an appropriate case requires that it be rethought, I suppose I would have the duty to think of it in terms that I have not yet been called upon to do.

Well, I think, Senator, there is already such a statute, at least with respect to such searches by State agents, in section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act, the Ku Klux Klan Act, authorizing the damage remedy. I think part of the concern is not really the absence of some remedy, but concern as to whether or not the remedy is effective, because of the natural tendency of the jury to understand the sincere motivation of an officer's conduct in trying to get evidence to establish guilt and the disinclination to award damages to one who may be, appear to be, guilty of a crime. So there is a question of whether even though the remedy exists it is effective in accomplishing the purpose for which it is intended. I am more or less parroting the arguments that have been made and I have heard, but I want to avoid trying to state anything in the nature of a final conclusion.

Well, of course, the major case is Angler, I think is the name, which extended the right to counsel in misdemeanor cases, which was a profoundly important case in making sure that in any case which might involve incarceration of the defendant that he or she would be represented by counsel. There has not been the same extension, as I recall, to the provision of counsel in the discretionary appellate review. I frankly am not sure as I sit here whether the Court has held that there should not be counsel or it is just under consideration.

SO those two cases can be cited with the trend going in both directions at once. The right to counsel has been extended to misdemeanor cases but not extended to discretionary review.

Yes; I don't hesitate in saying that I think one of the most important aspects of procedural fairness is availability of counsel to the litigant on either side. I could not overemphasize the importance of the lawyer's role in the adversary process and it is unquestionably a matter of major importance in all litigation.

Thank you, Senator Tunney. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
