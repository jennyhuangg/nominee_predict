Thank you very much, Senator. 

I know of no limits 011 what the Senate should explore, Senator Bayh.

Of course. 

I am.

That statement listed all of the securities which either I, my wife, or my son owned. That statement does not include certain cash which I have; it does not include life insurance; it does not include any tangible personal property and I may say for the benefit of my wife, who is in the room, she claims all of it except my guns. [Laughter.]

That hadn't occurred to me yet. 

Senator Bayh, I agree that that is a troublesome problem. In the relatively limited time available, I have tried to acquaint myself with what has been done by certain other members of the Court. Also, 1 have read the preliminary draft of the proposednew canons of judicial ethics and 1 have had my partners do some research. 1 would recognize as the binding principle, to which 1 will attempt to adhere, both to the letter and the spirit, the canons of judicial ethics. I recognize they are not legally binding on the members of the judiciary but I think increasingly they will be so regarded. I am aware also of 28 U.S.C.A. 455, and obviously I would complv with that.

That is correct. 

They interpret it very narrowly. The proposed new canons, I think, use the phrase "any interest." 

Yes. I would s&y this, to amplify that response, Senator Bayh: Obviously 1 have some problems. The canon, as 1 read it, imposes a duty on a judge as promptly as he reasonably can to dispose of securities which are in companies which are likely to come before the Court. Obviously, one would have to do some speculating as to the latter part of that standard. There is a further condition that his obligation is to dispose of them where he can do so without substantial loss. The principal holding which I have, and which my family also has, including not only my wife and son but my two sisters and a brother, is a holding that came to us through gifts from my father many years ago. We could not sell that holding without veiy substantial tax adjustments. 

It is Sperrv & Hutchinson. 

The S. & H. Green Stamp Co.; that is right. My father's family furniture manufacturing company was merged into the Sperry & Hutchinson Co. a couple of j^ears ago, so that the family has substantial or comparatively large holdings in that company. 

I would certainhT have to disqualify myself if a case came to Court involving that company. 

I would be happy to do so. I was first informed this was a technique that might be helpful and that had been used by others. My investigation through lawyers in my office is not yet complete; and jTet I would say as of now I think a blind trust would probably be of little assistance. It may be a dut}T, in fact the new canons suggest there is a duty, on a judge to69-267—71 14ascertain what he does hold. If that affirmative duty exists, a blind trust would be a bit awkward.

However you made it, I think, in a situation such as you have described, you would have that problem.

I certainly do. 

I would agree that the appearance of impropriety certainly merits serious consideration. It is quite important for the public to have confidence in the members of the Court that they have no interest other than to do justice under law. 

Senator Bayh, I would just like to add one comment to be sure that I have answered your inquiry completely. I would endeavor promptly to limit my list of investments so as properly to comply with the letter and spirit of the canons. There are some investments I would certainly wish to retain; I mentioned one of the major ones. There are several others that are involved in corporations which I have represented over many years. If they should be involved in litigation in court—-certainly for the foreseeable future—I would not take part in it. 

Well, most certainly I would not take any part in those cases, Senator Bayh. There are all sorts of situations that I have thought about and, of course, 3"ou have 

Well, how far does one go over the years with respect to old clients of one's firm? I think that raises a host of questions. As you know, having practiced law with distinction yourself, you have allsorts of clients. We have had hundreds of clients; some come back year after year; others we never see again. Some are retained, most are not. So I think the specific answer would have to be made in relation to the specific factual situation. I certainly can assure you that my own effort and every inclination would be to lean over backward in this respect to avoid the appearance of impropriety; and yet, I suppose every judge has to bear in mind if he leans over backward too far when it is not really justified, he imposes additional burdens on other members of the court.

[ believe one of the provisions of section 2, or article 2 rather, of the proposed new canons says in substance the judge should not serve in a case with respect to which he has formed a fixed opinion or has a fixed view as to the issue involved; and I would certainly accept that as a sound rule.

It covers a lot of ground, doesn't it? 

I will address first of all the broader question of what you described as the right of privacy, and I may say that my views, perhaps, have changed dramatically over the past two and a half weeks. I now think the right of privacy would be a very fine thing. [Laughter.]

I am sure you have. Seriously, I once read the Griswold case; I suppose you have reference to it? 

I have not read it recently. I remember, of course, as every law student does, there was no specific provision of the Constitution that spelled out a right of privacy; the right was inferred from a collection of other rights. I suppose the correct posture for me to take at this moment is that I would certainly view any such case with an open mind and attempt to reach a decision based on the facts and the law and the Constitution. I would say, not as a prospective judge but generally as a citizen, that I think all Americans have the right not to have their privacy unduly intruded upon; there is no question about that. Do you wish me to move on into the wiretapping area which you mentioned? 

I wrote a letter to you, Senator Bayh, when I received a request through the Justice Department for copies of talks that I had made, and knowing of your interest in this particular area, I sent you copies of the only talks of which I have any recollection that I have made relating to electronic surveillance. I would like to say for the benefit of the committee that as a civilian lawyer without any criminal trial experience, my first interest in the criminal law arose when I was president-elect of the American Bar Association, and I was tn-ing to plan a program for my j^ear as president; and I ended up with three programs which seemed to me to be fairly significant. One was the initiation of the criminal justice project of the American Bar Association with which I am sure all members of this committee are familiar. I had to do some study in connection with that. I will pass over that project for a moment and move to the President's Crime Commission— President Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice. I was assigned to two subcommittees of that Commission: One was the Subcommittee on the Courts; the other was the Subcommittee on Organized Crime. That was my first, literally my first, insight and information as to what organized crime in this country really is doing to our people. It was there for the first time that I became interested with the problem of Avhether or not electronic surveillance was needed by law enforcement and whether adequate safeguards could be imposed by legislation which would protect the public against the intrusion that this form of surveillance makes possible. A majority of the President's Commission, including myself, found that the law was then in a very chaotic state. You are all familiar with it: I will not review it, but under the Olmstead case, wiretapping was not deemed to be a violation of the fourth amendment and yet under the Communications Act of 1934, the fruits of the surveillancewere not admissible in court. So we had the worst of all worlds, with uncontrolled wiretapping allowed but the fruits of it not being available for use even in proper criminal proceedings.So the principal thrust of the Crime Commission's report was that Federal legislation was urgently needed.It was needed, we thought, for two reasons: First, to outlaw all unauthorized wiretapping, and that was done in unequivocal language in the Omnibus Crime Act of 1968.The second principal recommendation of the Commission was that a court-controlled system of wiretapping be established by the Congress to deal with cases of major crime, directed primarily against organized crime. That recommendation may have had some influence on the Congress in the enactment of title III of the act of 1968.At that point, my interest in the subject, except from a purely academic way, ended until the ABA criminal justice project decided to put out standards in this area, standards primarily to guide the States; and so, as I am sure you know, Senator Bayh, the ABA house of delegates last February did adopt standards with respect to electronic surveillance, and I served on the ABA Criminal Justice Committee; I supported those standards.I have made, as I recall, three talks in which I mentioned this subject, and I think I sent all of those to you.

I think you are now moving, if I understand your question, into the areas of national security and domestic subversion. The ABA standards did incorporate provisions with respect to national security cases but did not require a prior court order. This involves action by a foreign powei in espionage or comparable situations. The ABA standards did not address the far more troublesome area of internal security surveillance.I have never studied that. I alluded to it in two of the talks which I sent to }Tou. I understand that at least one case is either on the docket or on its wajr to the Court, and I doubt whether I should go beyond what I have said on that topic.Senatoi BAYH. Let me just read the ABA final draft and the tentative draft and ask }^ou if you would care to comment further than you already have.The final draft dealing with this specific point says, and I am sure you are familiar with this, but just to refresh 3Tour memory to have it in the record, let me read it: "The special committee rejected any reading of the fourth amendment that would invariably require compliance with a court order system before surveillance in interest in national securitj' could be termed constitutionally reasonable."The tentative draft has the following language:The Committee considered and rejected language which would have recognized a comparable residuary power in the President not subject to prior judicial review to deal with purely domestic subversive groups. This is not, of course, to say that there may not be domestic threats to the national security. It is to say, however, that there is a valid distinction in how each ought to be treated insofar as these techniques are concerned.Would you care to comment further on those thoughts expressed by the ABA committee?Mr. POWELL. I think they accord with my recollection, Senator Bayh, and I was on that committee.

Well, the statute outlines a number of requirements that must be met. I am sure I cannot recall them all. There is the lequirement of showing probable cause, and of showing that the necessary evidence to convict the suspected criminal cannot be obtained in any other waj'. There must be a limitation on the time, which cannot exceed 30 days. If there should be a desire to extend that time, there must be a new application to the court and a fresh showing of the continued or new probable cause; and again the results of the tap have to be reported. There are some other requirements, but these are the essential ones, as I recall them. 

AS I recall, some of the discussion we had on the Criminal Justice Committee tried to deal with this problem and that was considered. It was also considered whether or not perhaps other standards could not be prescribed by law.The situation is obviously different from organized crime. As 3-011 say, I don't think anybody would support uncontrolled surveillance against citizens because they criticized the Government. On the other hand, as you move closer and closer to cooperation and coordination with agents of an alien power who are trying to act in a hostile way to our Government, you can see that prescribing standards becomes extremely difficult.

In view of the possibility of this matter coming before the Court, I think I had better stand where I already stand, which is in support of the American Bar Association's standards, which I must say I think would meet the situation that you described.

Well, this was obviously one of the problems that caused the ABA committee to decide that it did not have enough information, really, to deal with the problem. In other words, I don't think—I speak only for myself; I have no idea what sort of information is available to the responsible people in government concerning possible acts of violence, for example, against a government building. It may be contemplated solely by Americans, not agents of a foreign power.

I would certainly say this: If I were in the Congress of the United States I would address that problem very seriously. In other words, I would see if you could not devise standards that would be compatible both with the public interest and public protection, and with whatever necessities may exist with respect to responsible lawenforcement people; and I think in the talk that I made to the Richmond Bar Association I suggested, when I put this problem aside in a paragraph just in the interest of clarity, that this may be an area in which legislation is necessary.

Senator, I think I can say that I understand your concern and I think if I were sitting where you were I would be asking the same questions.The only hesitation I have is in resorting to speculation, and it would be speculating to a large extent because I have not studied how this problem might be dealt with. I would certainly undertake a study of it and I would think that many, if not most, of the safeguards that are in the act of 1968 could be applied. I would not wish to identify those that couldn't be—I may be getting into areas that could possibly embarrass me if I should be confirmed to the Court.

Conceivably that may be the very issue before the Court. I don't know enough about it to know. I can only say that I share, believe me, I share deeply the concerns that }TOU have expressed and that I know are in your mind, and I think ever}^ American shares deep concern at the thought of any monitoring by electronic surveillance or otherwise of what people think on political, social, or economic issues. But when you move into the area of threatening to commit a crime or conspiring to commit a crime, that seems to me to come very close to the provisions of title III.

I would certainly consider all law and facts that seemed to me to be relevant.

I would think it would be relevant, and I would certainly consider the entire case in light of the Bill of Rights and the restrictions in the Constitution of the United States for the benefit of the people of our country. 

I would consider that and all other relevant facts and, circumstances under the law. 

Senator, I wish you wouldn't ask me that question. I don't think I ought to speculate as to just what the Supreme Court might do, whether or not I am on it. 

I think the record is pretty clear on that, what the ABA did. Mr. BAYH. HOW about Mr. Lewis Powell? Mr. POWELL. I was a member of the committee and voted for the action that prevailed, and I suppose that 

I might be what? 

I would reserve final judgment until I were confronted with the problem, but I would say without any hesitation as I think my Richmond Bar talk demonstrated, I have no fixed view on the delicate area that you have been discussing. I do have a fixed view on the other two areas, and am on record, at least I had a fixed view when those reports were submitted. I have not studied either one in depth since then, but at that time I certainly agreed with the Crime Commission Report and the ABA position. But on the third issue, domestic subversion, I have no fixed view. I have not studied it with that care. I can see all sorts of problems that you have outlined. 

The article was one that I wrote for the Richmond Times-Dispatch and it was picked up by the FBI Journal and more recently by the New York Times. I actually wrote the article, and I think this may be of interest in light of your line of questioning, not to address this subject specifically but to address the issue of repression; and if I may digress for a moment because this does seem to me to be important, I have four children. I have two who are in college, one in law school, a daughter at UCLA, and a son who is a sophomore at Washington and Lee. I spend a good deal of time with the A'oung and one of the things that distresses me most is the widely prevailing view among the young that America is a repressive society. Now, I can understand how a good many of them Avould have that impression and certainly acts of repression exist in this country; they have ahvays existed. And I am afraid they ahvays will; but it seems to me, though, they are episodic and not the result of any systematized point of view on the part of anybody, and on balance I have the deep conviction that America is the freest of all lands. I have a deep conviction that the Bill of Rights is reArered not only by the citizens but by the courts and the legislative and executive bodies of our country.As a lawyer I am satisfied that criminal justice, Avith all of its faults, and heaA^en knoAvs there are many, criminal justice nevertheless is commendable, on the Avhole, in the United States of America, and that most people, once they get to a court of record—I am not talking at the moment about problems Ave are all familiar Avith in the courts Avhere the misdemeanors are tried, but at the felony leA^el—I firml}' believe, and I cited, I believe, Judge Traynor, former chief justice of California, for the view that one is more likely to have a fair trial in the United States than in almost any other country in the Avorld, as long as the safeguards of a fair trial exist and as long as free speech and free press exist, the right to assemble exists in this country, I do not believe our society is repressiA'e. I think it is terribly unfortunate for the young of our people to think that it is. That is not to sscj that they shouldn't fight to eliminate AvhateA'er examples of repression or unfairness or injustice exist and there are plenty of them, but to turn against the structure of our Avhole free society seems to me a disaster.I Avrote the article Avith that point in mind. I Avas not Avriting a laAV revieAv article. I think the language you read—I think the language Avas accurate—Avas addressed primarily to this hazy area AA^here internal security and national security, AA^here internal dissidents are cooperating or working affirmatively AAdth, or are very sympathetic to countries, other poAvers, that may be enemies of the United States.This is a verjT difficult area. Drawing that line, as I have said, is very perplexing.But to come back to your question, I do not consider it was a fixed view considering the circumstances under which it was expressed, the brevity of expression—I was not writing a law review article. And yet I would add one other point, Senator, just to be absolutely clear: If I should go on the Court, and this Sixth Circuit case comes up after I come on the Court, I will be very conscious of the fact that I have written a few things, very few, really, in this area; and it may well be that I will disqualify myself. At the moment I would rather not say positively that I will or I won't.

I understand. 

I will not be insensitive to that, Senator Ba}7h, I can assure you. 

I would prefer that, Senator Bayh. (The material referred to follows:)[From the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Sunday, August 1, 1971]CIVIL LIBERTIES REPRESSION: FACT OR F I C T I O N ? — " L A W - A B I D I N G CITIZENS HAVE NOTHING TO F E A R "(By Lewis F. Powell Jr.)(Lewis F. Powell Jr., a Richmond lawyer who has closely followed developments in the exploding field of "civil liberties," is a former president of the American Bar Association. He has also served as chairman of the State Board of Education, chairman of the Richmond School Board and member of the 15-man Blue Bibbon Defense Panel named by President Nixon to study the Defense Department.)At a time when slogans often substitute for rational thought, it is fashionable to charge that "repression" of civil liberties is widespread. This charge—directed primarily against law enforcement—is standard leftist propaganda. It is also made and widely believed on the earapih, in the arts and theater, in the pulpit, andamong some of the media. Many persons genuinely concerned about civil liberties thus join in promoting or accepting the propaganda of the radical left.A recent syndicated article, by AP writer Bernard Gavzer, cited several such persons. According to Prof. Charles Reich of Yale, American "is at the brink of . . . a police state". Prof. Allan Dershowitz of Harvard decries the "contraction of our civil liberties."The charge of repression is not a rifle shot at occasional aberrations. Rather, it is a sweeping shotgun blast at "the system," which is condemned as systematically repressive of those accused of crime, of minorities and of the right to dissent.Examples ritualistically cited are the "plot" against Black Panthers, the indictment of the Berrigans, the forthcoming trial of Angela Davis and the mass arrests during the Washington Mayday riots.The purpose of this article is to examine, necessarily in general terms, the basis for the charge of repression. Is it fact or fiction?There are, of course, some instances of repressive action. Officials are sometimes overzealous; police do employ unlawful means or excess force; and injustices do occur even in the courts. Such miscarriages occur in every society. The real test is whether these are episodic departures from the norm, or whether they are as charged part of a system of countenanced repression.The evidence is clear that the charge is a false one. America is not a repressive society. The Bill of Rights is widely revered and zealously safeguarded by the courts. There is in fact no significant threat to individual freedom in this country by law enforcement.Solicitor General Griswold, former dean of the Harvard Law School and member of the Civil Rights Commission, recently addressed this issue in a talk at the University of Virginia. He stated that there is greater freedom and less repression in America than in any other country.So much for the general framework of the debate about alleged repression. What are the specific charges?The attack has focused on wiretapping. There seems almost to be a conspiracy to confuse the public. The impression studiously cultivated is of massive eavesdropping and snooping by the FBI and law enforcement agencies. The right of privacy, cherished by all, is said to be widely threatened.Some politicians have joined in the chorus of unsubstantiated charges. Little effort is made to delineate the purposes or the actual extent of electronic surveillance.The facts, in summary, are as follows: The Department of Justice employs wiretapping in two types of situations: (i) against criminal conduct such as murder, kidnapping, extortion, and narcotics offenses: and (ii) in national security cases.Wiretapping against crime was expressly authorized by Congress in 1968. But the rights of suspect-, are carefully safeguarded. There must be a prior court order, issued only upon a showing of probable cause. The place and duration are strictly controlled. Ultimate disclosure of the taps is required. There are heavy penalties for unauthorized surveillance. Any official or FBI agent who employs a wiretap without a court order in a criminal case is subject to imprisonment and fine.During 1969 and 1970, such federal wiretaps were employed in only 309 cases. More than 900 arrests resulted, with some 500 persons being indicted including several top leaders of organized crime.The government also employs wiretaps in counterintelligence activities involving national defense and internal security. The 1968 Act left this delicate area to the inherent power of the president.Civil libertarians oppose the use of wiretapping in all cases, including its use against organized crime and foreign espionage. Since the 1968 Act, however, the attack has focused on its use in internal security cases and some courts have distinguished these from foreign threats. The issue will be before the Supreme Court at the next term.There can be legitimate concern whether a president should have this power with respect to internal "enemies." There is, at least in theory, the potential for abuse. This possibility must be balanced against the general public interest in preventing violence (e.g. bombing of Capitol) and organized attempts to overthrow the government.One of the current rmt^s is that the Depa mci t of Justice is usurp ng new powers. The truth is that wiretapping, LS the most effective detection means, has been used against espionage and subversion for at least three decades under six presidents.There may have been a time when a valid distinction existed between external and internal threats. But such a distinction is now largely meaningless. Theradical left, strongly led and with a growing base of support, is plotting violence and revolution. Its leaders visit and collaborate with foreign Communist enemies. Freedom can be lost as irrevocably from revolution as from foreign attack.The question is often asked why, if prior court authorization to wiretap is required in ordinary criminal cases, it should not also be required in national security cases. In simplest terms the answer given by government is the need for secrecy.Foreign powers, notably the Communist ones, conduct massive espionage and subversive operations against America. They are now aided by leftist radical organizations and their sympathizers in this country. Court-authorized wiretapping requires a prior showing of probable cause and the ultimate disclosure of sources. Public disclosure of this sensitive information would seriously handicap our counter-espionage and counter-subversive operations.As Atty. Gen. John Mitchell has stated, prohibition of electronic surveillance would leave America as the "only nation in the world" unable to engage effectively in a wide area of counter-intelligence activities necessary to national security.Apparently as a part of a mindless campaign against the FBI, several nationally known political leaders have asserted their wires were tapped or that they were otherwise subject to surveillance. These charges received the widest publicity from the news media.The fact is that not one of these politicians has been able to prove his case. The Justice Department has branded the charges as false.The outcry against wiretapping is a tempest in a teapot. There are 210 million Americans. There are only a few hundred wiretaps annually, and these are directed against people who prey on their fellow citizens or who seek to subvert our democratic form of government. Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear.In the general assault on law enforcement, charges of police repression have become a reflexive response by many civil libertarians as well as by radicals.Examples are legion. Young people are being incited not to respect law officers but to regard them as "pigs". Black Panther literature, in the vilest language, urges the young to assault the police.The New York Times and the Washington Post reported, as established fact, that 28 Panthers had been gunned down b}r police since January 1968. Ralph Abernathy attributed the death of Panther leaders to a "calculated design of genocide". Julian Bond charged that Panthers are being "decimated by police assassination arranged by the federal police appaiatus." Even Whitney Young referred to "nearly 30 Panthers murdered by law enforcement officials."These charges, upon investigation (by the New Yorker magazine, among others), turned out to be erroneous. The fact are that two—possible four at most— Panthers may have been shot by police without clear justification. Many of the 28 Panthers were killed by other Panthers. There is no evidence whatever of a genocide conspiracy.But the truth rarely overtakes falsehood—especially when the latter is disseminated by prestigious newspapers. Millions of young Americans, especially blacks, now believe these false charges. There is little wonder that assaults on police are steadily increasing.The latest outcry against law enforcement was provoked by the mass arrests in Washington on May 3. Some 20,000 demonstrators, pursuant to carefully laid plans, sought to bring the federal government to a halt.This was unlike prior demonstrations in Washington, as the avowed purpose of this one was to shut down the government. The mob attempted to block main traffic arteries during the early morning rush hours. Violence and property destruction were not insignificant. Some 39 policemen were injured. Indeed, Deputy Atty. Gen. Kleindienst has revealed that the leaders of this attack held prior consultations with North Vietnamese officials in Stockholm.Yet, because thousands were arrested, the American Civil Liberties Union and other predictable voices cried repression and brutality. The vast majority of those arrested were released, as evidence adequate to convict a particular individual is almost impossible to obtain in a faceless mob.The alternative to making mass arrests was to surrender the government to insurrectionaries. This would have set a precedent of incalculable danger. It also would have allowed a mob to deprive thousands of law-abiding Washington citizens of their rights to use the streets and to have access to their offices and homes.Those who charge repression say that dissent is suppressed and free speech denied. Despite the wide credence given this assertion, it is sheer nonsense. There is no more open society in the world than America. No other press is as free.No other country accords its writers and artists such untrammeled freedom. No Solzhenitsyns are persecuted in America.What other government would allow the Chicago Seven, while out on bail, to preach revolution across the land, vastly enriching themselves in the process?What other country would tolerate in wartime the crescendo of criticism of government policy? Indeed, what other countn* would allow its citizens—including some political leaders—to negotiate privately with the North Vietnamese enemy?Supreme Court decisions sanctify First Amendment freedoms. There is no prior restraint of any publication, except possibly in flagrant breaches of national security. There is virtually no recourse for libel, slander or even incitement to revolution.The public, including the young, are subjected to filth and obscenities—openly published and exhibited.The only abridgement of free speech in this country is not by government. Rather, it comes from the radical left—and their bemused supporters—who do not tolerate in others the rights they insist upon for themselves.Prof. Herbert Marcuse of California, Marxist idol of the New Left, freely denounces "capitalist repression" and openly encourages revolution. At the same time he advocates denial of free speech to those who disagree with his "progressive" views.It is common practice, especially on the campus, for leftists to shout down with obscenities any moderate or conservative speaker or physically to deny such speaker the rostrum.A recurring theme in the repression syndrome is that Black Panthers and other dissidents cannot receive a fair trial.The speciousness of this view has been demonstrated recently by acquittals in the New Haven and New York Panther cases—the very ones with respect to which the charge of repression was made by nationally known educators and ministers.The rights of accused persons—without regard to race or belief—are more carefully safeguarded in America than in any other country. Under our system the accused is presumed to be innocent; the burden of proof lies on the state; guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt; public jury trial is guaranteed; and a guilty verdict must be unanimous.In Recent Years, dramatic decisions of the Supreme Court have further strengthened the rights of accused persons and correspondingly limited the powers of law enforcement. There are no consitutional decisions in other countries comparable to those rendered in the cases of Escobedo and Miranda.Rather than "repressive criminal justice," our system subordinates the safety of society to the rights of persons accused of crime. The need is for greater protection—not of criminals but of law-abiding citizens.A corollary to the "fair trial" slander is the charge that radicals are farmed and tried for political reasons. This is the world-wide Communist line with respect to Angela Davis. Many Americans repeat this charge against their own country, while raising no voice against the standard practice of political and secret trials in Communist countries.The radical left, with wide support from the customary camp followers, also is propagandizing the case of the Berrigans.The guilt or innocence of these people remains to be determined by juries of their peers in public trials. But the crimes charged are harldy "political." In the Davis case a judge and three others were brutally murdered. The Berrigans, one of whom stands convicted of destroying draft records, are charged with plots to bomb and kidnap.Some trials in our country have been politicized—but not by government. A new technique, recently condemned by Chief Justice Warren Burger, has been developed by the Kunstlers and others who wish to discredit and destroy our system. Such counsel and defendants deliberately seek to turn courtrooms into Roman spectacles—disrupting the trial, shouting obscenities and threatening violence. It is they—not the system—who demean justice.The answer to all of this was recently given by former California Chief Justice Roger J. Traynor, who said: "It is irresponsible to echo such demagogic nonsense as the proposition that one group or another in this country cannot get a fair trial. . . . No country in the world has done more to insure fair trials."America has its full share of problems. But significant or systematic government repression of civil liberties is not one of them.The radical left—expert in such matters—knows the charge of repression is false. It is a cover for leftist-inspired violence and repression. It is also a propaganda line designed to undermine confidence in our free institutions, to brainwash the youth and ultimately to overthrow our democratic system.It is unfortunate that so many nonradical Americans are taken in by this leftist line. They unwittingly weaken the very institutions of freedom they wish to sustain. They may hasten the day when the heel of repression is a reality—not from the sources now recklessly defamed but from whatever tyranny follows the overthrow of representative government. This is the greatest danger to human liberty in America.

I can certainly say I don't want anybody tailing me, Senator Bayh. I think it is a little difficult to say, to describe the circumstances under which taking pictures would have inhibiting effect. There are a certain number of people who enjoy having their pictures taken. I would prefer not to, and it would chill me, I can tell you that.

Well, I certainly don't wish to comment on anything that

I come from the State that produced Mason, Jefferson, Madison. I think Mason wrote the first Declaration of Rights that went into a constitution in Virginia—well, in this country, perhaps was the model from which our Bill of Rights was drawn. 1 think it was Madison who led the fight to have the Bill of Rights incorporated into the Constitution for the reasons you have stated. 

It is a little hard for me to answer that, Senator. I would think the facts and circumstances would have to be examined carefully. I don't know whether any law is applicable to this or not. I am sure there is no specific constitutional provision as to taking pictures, but I think one can conceive of circumstances where there are no laws and there certainly should be.

I am tempted to say yes, but the honest truth is that I have never considered this area. I have had the general feeling, and I have had one or two clients ask me about harassment by other individuals, not government, for example—telephone calls in the middle of the night, people constantly observing what someone else does. The laws in our State were woefully inadequate. I have not thought, although I must confess I have never studied it carefully, that there was any constitutional provision that would prevent a private citizen from doing this. I just have not studied this, Senator Bayh. But it is a practice that obviously is distasteful to the public, I would think, carried to the extremes that you indicated.

I would certainly not favor the type of activity you have described. I read about it in the press. To the extent it exists, I think it is extremely unfortunate; and if a case arose involving those facts, I would certainly think that the Court would have to consider them.

Senator, the only think I have written out in preparation for this hearing is a partial answer to your question. I read in the press that this question had been asked others. I would say by way of preface that obviously I am not speaking for the President of the United States. I am trying to sort out my own views. As a lawyer, it rarely occurs to me to think, in fact, it has never occurred to me until recently to think of judicial philosophy. I do have a view as to the role of the Court and I will address that in a moment. I would think that one's philosophy, whether it be with respect to social or economic problems or political problems, whether he is conservative, liberal, or moderate, to use the current terminology, does not necessarily relate to his concept of the role of the Court as a judicial institution. So, if I may, with the permission of the chairman, I would like to read what I wrote out in very simple terms indicating my own concept of the role of the Court. My thoughts about the role of the Court, expressed as simply as I •can, may be summarized as follows: (1) I believe in the doctrine of separation of powers. The courts must ever be mindful not to encroach upon the areas of the responsibilities of the legislative and executive branches. (2) I believe in the Federal system, and that both State and Federal •courts must respect and preserve it according to the Constitution. (3) Having studied under then Professor Frankfurter, I believe in the importance of judicial restraint, especially at the Supreme Court level. This means as a general rule, but certainly not in all cases, avoiding a decision on constitutional grounds where other grounds are available. (4) As a lawyer I have a deep respect for precedent. I know the importance of continuity and reasonable predictability of the law. This is not to sajT that every decision is immutable but there is normally a strong presumption in favor of established precedent. (5) Cases should be decided on the basis of the law and facts before the Court. In deciding each case, the judge must make a conscious and determined effort to put aside his own political and economic views and his own predilections and to the extent possible to put aside whatever subtle influences may exist from his own background and experience. And, finally, although all the three branches of Government are duty bound to protect our liberties, the Court, as the final authorky, lias the greatest responsibility to uphold the rule of law and to protect and safeguard the liberties guaranteed all of our people by the Bill of Rights and the 14th amendment. 

I feel that that presumption exists with respect to all precedents. I think the lawyers would also add that generally the longer a case has existed, the more frequently it has been cited and relied upon, the stronger the presumption against overruling it inevitably becomes.I think, also, if a case is decided by a divided Court and is a recent decision, the presumption perhaps is less vigorous than if it had been decided earlier by a unanimous Court. Just, for example, nobody would suggest today that Brown against Board of Education, unanimously decided in 1954, is not the law of the land.

DO you wish a comment on that? 

I have not read that interview since the time I gave itr but if that is all I said, it may have been what I was thinking about was this: I have been deeply interested in education, and one of the things that has impressed itself very deeply on my consciousness in the education world is the impact of television, not only with respect to children in my home but on the basis of studies that have been made in the school systems. Television does have a profound effect on the young. With all due respect to our friends who arrange some of the television programs, there has, in my judgment, over a period of time—I think there has been improvement recently, by the way—but there has been, over a period of time, it would seem to me, far too much emphasis on violence, and violence is one of the scourges of our society; and it has concerned me deeply to see this emphasis on violence, viewed daily by millions of young children. I think that is what I had in mind. 

NO, indeed. 

I believe deeply in the first amendment, and I certainly do not approve of any censorship. I don't think anything I have ever written suggested that. 

I do feel that legislation enacted by the Congress and for the most part by the States—and I speak of my State of Virginia, which has just adopted a new constitution; I served on the commission which wrote it—I think under the law our black citizens have achieved equality, I think, by law, perhaps, to a greater extent than in any other country with which I have familiarity.The question which remains quite clearly is whether, (1) in the implementation of the law at all levels and (2) in the hearts and minds of men, the desired equality has been attained, and I would answer, I think, both of those negatively at this point.

I had not written out anything, Senator Tunney, but I did take some notes to try to refresh my recollection. This is not a direct response as to civil rights but it may give you and other members of the committee, Mr. Chairman, some flavor of my extracurricular activities over a fairly long life. This may be an inappropriate comment, but I had a mother and father who had a deep conviction that all human beings were equal and that no one was better than anyone else; and I inherited that and have never departed from it.I have tried in addition to being active, very active practicing law and very active in the profession, to engage in outside activities which seem to me to be useful in my community and State.I was an early volunteer in legal aid work in the city of Richmond and went on the board of the Family Services Society which administered under the Community Chest most of the social work for both black and white. I became president of the Family Services Society fairly early in my career.The criminal justice project of the American Bar Association, which I mentioned earlier, was only one area in which I devoted much of my attention wThen 1 was president of the bar association.The second area related to providing legal services to the poor and this meant primarily for the blacks, and I think some of the statements that have been filed here and to which I will not allude in any detail, document the role that I played in that critical point in our history.I have referred to the criminal justice project—there are 16 volumes of that and I think if any of you gentlemen have had an opportunity to review them you will be impressed, as T am, by the fact that they are designed to make meaningful the inscription on the front of the Supreme Court Building: "Equal Justice Under Law."I have spent a good deal of time in education, and soim of the statements I think were filed here have alluded to what was done and some of the things I didn't do, some of the things that, perhaps, I tried to do. I am sure that many would view in a different lightmy service on the school board in the city of Richmond but we kept the schools open and we tried to be fair to all concerned.I have served as an officer and on the board of the American Bar foundation, and if anyone has examined a list of the studies that we have made and the publications that the American Bar Foundation has produced during my tenure over the past 2 years as president, I think he will find a fairly genuine concern for the areas about which you asked me.There are articles that I have written that may possibly be relevant in this area. I have had a special interest in the jury trial and its preservation and the avoiding of any impairment of it because it is so fundamental to our system. I did an article in the Washington and Lee Law Review on Jury Trials. I did a study, in fact took a leading role in trying to assure fair trial on the very thorny problem of fair trial—free press. Some of the gentlemen in the media are familiar with that and they didn't always agree with me, but I realize a balance had to be drawn and I think real progress has been made in that respect.I was a participant and a planner of the Conference on Legal Services that was held here in Washington jointly sponsored by the Justice Department and the OEO, at which the entire thrust of the 3-day conference was to assure more adequate legal services for the people who needed them most. For the most part they were our black brothers.

Senator Hart. 

NO.

Has the effect of what, sir? 

AS I said, earlier, I would not consider any inquiry off limits. There may be some inquiries that I think would be inappropriate for me to respond to, but I certainly have no objection to any questions that you or other members of the committee may care to ask me about philosophy. I may not be able to field them very well, but I will do the best I can. 

I think we would all agree that one must start from the language of the Constitution itself, endeavoring to ascertain the meaning of the language. I think we all recognize, as you imply, that certain language in the Constitution, such as the due process clause, the equal protection clause, the commerce clause, for example, in itself affords little in the way of specific guidelines merely as language.Of course, there is a vast body of history with respect to due process, sa}^, which certainly goes back to 1215, to Magna Carta, and all the English meaning that has been read into it over the years.But it seems to me that what is really important with respect to' the great freedom clauses—those you have mentioned—are the spirit and intent of the Bill of Rights, and obviously they have to be considered in the light of the case before the court.

Senator, I think you were perhaps not in the room when Senator Bayh asked me that question. I am happy to answer it again. 

Right. The shortest answer I can give, and I will elaborate to whatever extent you wish, is that I will endeavor to the best of my ability to comply with the canons of judicial ethics and with the relevant statute which is 28 U.S.C.A. 555. The canons, which are now undergoing revision, provide in substance on this point that a judge should dispose of securities, where he can do so without substantial loss, in companies which are likely to come before the Court. As I said to Senator Bayh in considerable detail, I have given this a good deal of consideration. He recognizes it as a real problem for me. I have read several articles that have been written on it,.one by Professor Davis, a second that appeared in the Duke Law Review, "Law and Contemporary Problems."I would endeavor to try to minimize my problem by selling off securities where I can do so without the type of loss referred to in the canons.

That will be my objective. 

I will have some problems, as I stated to Senator Bayh. 

There are several companies which for one reason or another I will not be able certainly in the foreseeable future to get out of. 

That is right, and I can assure you that I will take whatever safeguards or steps may be appropriate or necessary so that I will know which companies I do have holdings in. 

Yes.

From a personal point of view, it was quite serious. I would hate to have to live in the spotlight that certainly descended on my family the night the President made this announcement. But that is not a lawyer's judgment. I think any human being would have reacted to it the same way. So, from the viewpoint of deciding legal issues, I think that was a statement made in jest.

Oh, no; I don't object at all to this committee performing its duty. I was talking about people stopping me on the street and people wanting to interview my wife and my daughter and coming into our home for conferences. We were delighted to see them all, but I had never seen quite so many before. [Laughter.]

I think I did, sir. 

Yes, Senator Fong. And, again, as I previously said to Senator Bayh, this was written for the newspaper, directed primarily to the issue whether or not America has a repressive society, and my view was that the number of wiretaps as reported to the officer who administers the court system for the U.S. courts, and I have seen those reports each year, suggests that a relatively limited use has been made of the act of 1968? 

That is what I said, and I think that refers to the Federal cases. 

Right. And I believe, Senator, that I have since seen a report that indicated that for last year there were 597, both State and Federal. 

I have not seen those figures but I am sure you have it correct, if they are available. 

I have previously stated, Senator Fong, that my first opportunity to study this subject came when I was a member of the President's Crime Commission. I was appointed to the Subcommittee on Organized Crime, and it became fairly obvious to us, certainty to me, that unless the Government had the authority ta wiretap subject to court order in a strictly controlled system, that there would be little hope, if any, of ever coming to grips with organized crime in this country.

I think the category that certainly the Crime Commission was concerned with was primarily organized crime, but it is a little difficult just to say organized crime and nothing else. Organized crime itself engages in criminal activity that covers a fairly broad spectrum of crimes running from murder to extortion, to arson, to kidnaping, and the like. So that I suppose that when the bill was drafted—I had nothing whatever to do with that—that it was deemed necessary to include a spectrum of the major felonies, and the American Bar Association Committee felt the same way when it recommended standards for State legislatures.

Well, perhaps the term "gambling" needs to be defined. I am not—I don't know the answer to that. But our study of organized crime, to my surprise, indicated that gambling is the principal activity of organized crime in the final anslysis, and that of the profits that range fantastically from $5, $6, possibly $7 billion a year, from illegal and illicit activity, profits that come primarily from the poor and uneducated people of our country, most of those profits come from gambling.I see the problem that worries you but the other side of that problem is also very worrisome if we are ever going to bring organized crime within the law. This is what prompted us in the deliberations of the Crime Commission. As I said, I started out without having any preconceived notions whatever.

I believe that the Congress was wise in putting, as I recall, a 7-year time limitation on title III; and I believe, Senator McGlellan has either introduced a resolution or requested that a study be made before the 7 years expire, addressed primarily to the concerns that you have mentioned, Senator, and I agree that these concerns do exist, and I think the Congress should watch this situation with the diligence which apparently you are.

There were seven members of the President's Crime Commission who did recommend that unless there could be legislative relief that consideration should be given to a constitutional amendment which would have the effect of overruling the case— I think it was Griffin against California—where, by a divided Court, the constitution of California which permitted comment on the failure of an accused to take the stand was held unconstitutional under that amendment.

That was my opinion at that time, Senator. I have not given it mature consideration since. The Griffin case is now—this was 1964—-7 years old so it has become a precedent that I think is generally followed.

It has been nonexistent, Senator. 

NO, sir.

It is very difficult. 

Well, that argument is a very persuasive one. I think the argument that one deals with at the time, and again I am drawingon a rather ancient memory, is that the language in the fifth amendment says no one shall be compelled to give testimony against himself in a criminal case, and it didn't seem to me that there was compulsion involved in the circumstances you described.

Senator, I think perhaps I am not qualified to comment. I have never been before a grand jury in my life. I am not really familiar with the procedure you described. In fact, I never heard of it before.

I wouldn't want to express a legal opinion, but I would say it is very unfriendly. [Laughter.]

Thank you very much. 

Well, he certainly ought not to have his conversations with his lawyer wiretapped. Is that being done? 

Well, I did not know there was wiretapping after a man had been brought to trial. 

After indictment? Pretrial? 

IS this with respect to—well, perhaps I shouldn't inquire. I really don't have a basis for a judgment, Senator. I was wondering whether, though, it did apply to the same crime on which the indictment was based or some other crime?

It is unfriendly. I am not familiar with the practice. 

Thank you, sir. 

1 am afraid I didn't quite follow you, Senator. 

Yes.

I think what I intended to say was that the line between a peaceful demonstration and one that becomes not peaceful sometimes is difficult to draw. Demonstrations have been known to get out of hand. When they do get out of hand, then government must act; and so the consequences may be varied and somewhat unattractive. If they get out of hand they impair the rights of innocent people. If they get out of hand they also provoke action that sometimes may be overreaction, but I do not—I certainly do not express any reservation whatever as to the right peacefully to demonstrate.

Yes.

Yes.

I share the view you express, especially as of today, as contrasted perhaps with the midsixties when the bar moved very vigorously to try to broaden, as indeed the Congress did, the availability of legal services for the poor. The problem today with respect to the people who are not properly classified as the poor, but who have incomes above the poverty level but not large enough to enable them readily to hire counsel, is quite acute. Toward the end of my term as president of the American Bar Association I appointed a committee under the chairmanship of William McAlpin of St. Louis, I drew the resolution that specified the authority and powers of the commit tee, and it was directed to examine this whole problem including the question whether group legal services is an answer; and that committee has produced several reports.The American Bar Foundation has made an elaborate study. Nobody has yet found satisfactory answers that are broad enough to deal with the problem, but I certainly concur in your judgment that it is one of the more serous problems confronting the organized bar.

I would hope that the profession can find reasonable solutions. I doubt that you will ever find a solution that assures that every citizen can find a lawyer when he wants him at a price which he can afford to pay. But there have been forward movements with respect to group legal services. There is currently some experimentation with respect to insurance to provide coverage comparable in a sense to Blue Cross; there has been some activity, particularly in the larger cities, with neighborhood legal offices and, of course, the old technique of lawyer referral is a system which I think almost every bar continues to utilize in this respect.

I would think perhaps, Senator Mathias, it would be unwise for me to answer that question directly. I will certainly say that as of the time the supplemental statement was written tor the Crime Commission Report that I thought the minority opinions were the sounder opinions. Those decisions, as I recall, were 5 to 4. I was concerned with the impact of those decisions on two separate but obviously related issues. One was the right of the law enforcement people to do on-the-scene interrogation primarily before they got back to the stationhouse and, second, was the impact of those decisions on voluntary confessions.Now, the previous—on the first point as to on-the-scene interrogation, it seemed very difficult to me then, and perhaps it still is, although it is really not my field—I did ride in police cars in Richmond when I was on the Commission; and it is pretty awkward, really, when you are on the scene and a crime has been committed and you have one suspect or one fellow who you know was involved and not to be able to interrogate him to try to put your hands on who his confederates were; so it is a very real problem.The other problem relating to confessions is a more philosophical one. Most of the convictions in the criminal courts of our country arc on pleas of guilty, and most of the pleas of guilty resulted—our Commission studies disclosed—from admission of guilt, and it seemed at the time those decisions were decided, at least the minority of judges so thought, that the requirement that everyone be advised immediately of his right to counsel and that he understand clearly that he had that right then and there, would result in eliminating to a large extent the type of admissions that had been relied on so largely in the criminal justice system over the years.I personalty then preferred the English system which is based on whether or not the confessions are voluntary in fact, and that was the rule in the United States until those decisions.Now, I have not made any recent thorough study. I am aware that there are some analyses that have been made. I think there was one made by the Yale Law Journal that indicates that some of the fears that I had with respect to on-the-scene interrogation, for example, have not materialized in fact, but I personally have not seen the data.

1 would rather put it this way: We said in our supplemental statement that we recognized that the Court had very difficult issues to decide. Indeed on the facts in Escobido, I think, the Court decided the case, plainly correctly, but our concern was with respect to the scope of the opinion rather than with the precise decision.We thought that it was one of those very close constitutional issues and there was no criticism whatever of the majority. We recognized it had a perfectly clear line of argument to support its decision. I just happened to have the view that the minority opinion was the sounder one.

Yes.

I think the English have moved into that area and it has interested me; and I think I have suggested that it certainly merited serious study. It is a great tragedy to be a victim of crime and have no resources with which to compensate one's self. What it would cost in view of the magnitude of crime in our country, I have no idea; but this is a tragic void in our system. 

I certainly do. 

I will be happy to do so. My only connection with this entire subject, apart from being a citizen in the community, is this: The mayor of the city of Richmond and the city attorney had arranged a conference with the Attorney General to discuss the Attorney General's role under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 with respect to the annexation. For the benefit of members of the committee who may not be aware of it, the city of Richmond had annexed a portion of the adjacent county of Chesterfield and, under Virginia law, a city is separate and apart from all counties. In other words, it is not a part of any county. It has its own tax structure and the county has a separate tax structure. 

DO they have 

Well, you understand this part of the problem. The mayor asked me if I would accompany him to the conference because of my having served as chairman of the Commission whichwrote the council-manager form of government for the city of Richmond; and when we wrote that new charter for the city we abolished the ward system which had been an inequity in our city, as I viewed it, for many years; and we went to elections at large.There had been periodic discussions of going back to some form of ward system without regard to this annexation phase.I had also, when asked for my opinion, opposed going back to a ward S3rstem. A ward system in a city as small as Richmond seems to me to be undesirable. In any event I went with the mayor to see the Attorney General and I gave the Attorney General a memorandum which I think has been filed with this committee; and in that memorandum I argued that the annexation was in the best interests of all of the citizens of the community, and I feel that way deeply.It undoubtedly had the effect of diluting the black vote, but every annexation, certainly in States which have the population mix that Virginia has, would have that effect.I was in the preceding annexation case in the city of Richmond as counsel for Henrico County and I had some familiarity with annexation law and with the reasons why annexations are allowed in the State of Virginia; and I can assure this committee that those reasons had nothing whatever to do with race. They were economic, and if the city of Richmond is compelled to stay within its present boundaries, it will result, in the long run, in my judgment, in a disastrous situation for all of the people who are forced to live there.

I certainly subscribe to that. 

Thank you very much, Senator.CROUCH, BLAIR, CYPERT & WATERS, ATTORNEYS AT L<VW,Springdale, Ark., November 1, 1971.Hon. JOHN L. MCCLELLAN,U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. DEAR SENATOR MCCLELLAN: I sincerely hope that your Judiciary Committeewill look with great favor upon the Honorable Lewis F. Powell, Jr. for one of the positions on the Supreme Court.I first became acquainted with Mr. Powell in 1964 as our paths crossed when he was President of the American Bar Association and I was President Elect of the Arkansas Bar Association, and since that time I have followed his career with great interest and hold him in the highest esteem.His reputation as one of the outstanding lawyers of the nation and his impeccable character are so well known that anything I might say would be guilding the lily.Suffice to say, in my opinion the President made a very wise selection when he sent the name of Lewis F. Powell, Jr. to the Senate. He will add great stature to our High Court.With verjr kindest personal regards. Sincerely yours,COURTNEY C. CROUCH.

Well, as I have said, Senator, I would certainly not consider it appropriate to inject my own personal views with respect to a constitutional question of an act of Congress. 

The answer to that is clearly an affirmative. 

I certainly subscribe to those views, Senator. 

AS I think I said in response to questions from Senator Mathias, they were certainly my views at the time. I know of no reasons why at this time I should have different views although in fairness, it is a fact that some of the issues have not been reexamined by me since my study as a member of that Commission. 

I am, sir.

It does. 

Yes, sir.

I think I said or T intended to say 

NO. I agree with Senator Ervin, if I had had to decide Escobido, I would have set his conviction aside on the facts. In other words, I think it was a clear case, as the Senator has said, of the man being denied the right to counsel, when the counsel was sitting outside the room where he was being interrogated.I said with respect to the philosophy of those two majority opinions where they went in terms of prescribing, as it seemed to me, rather fixed standards of procedure without regard ultimately to whether or not a confession was in fact voluntary, went further than I would have gone.So I would have agreed as of that date with the minority opinion in those two cases.

Thank you, sir. 

I have no doubt on that. 

Well, that does pose an awkward question for me, Senator Hart. I quite understand though what concerns you.I think it is clear from the testimony I gave this morning that there are some decisions of the Warren court that trouble me, certainly at the time I studied them carefully, and this was the occasion of m}^ service on the President's Crime Commission. I also said that there were many other decisions which seemed to me to be decisions long overdue in our law. I tried to find, and have found, a paragraph in one of the talks that I gave—this was from an address I made to the Fourth Circuit Judicial Conference in 1965—and, if I may, I would like to read just one brief paragraph, which may shed some light.Before I do that, let me say this: As a lawyer, I never had any trouble with the Warren Court. I do not think many lawj^ers did. I do not have any trouble, I never have had trouble with the Supreme Court as an institution. I have disagreed with a good many decisions of various courts, and in decisions that are very, very close as to the issues involved, but respect for that tribunal and its role in our system has been one of the guiding lights in my professional career. I would never criticize the Court.But this paragraph that ma}- be relevant to what is in your mind reads as follows:The right to a fair trial, with all this term implies, is one of our most cherished rights. We have, therefore, welcomed the increased concern by law enforcement agencies and the courts alike in safeguarding a fair trail. Many of the decisions of the Supreme Court which are criticized today are likely in the perspective of history to be viewed as significant milestones in the ageless struggle to protect the individual from arbitrary and oppressive government.

It was in 1965. I would place the month at June or July. This was after most of them—perhaps it was before, it was before Miranda—but I had in mind, for example, cases like Gideon and Map p. 

I think that is a correct summary of what I said. 

I would agree with that. 

Of course.

1 would certainly think it conceivable that free expression could be thwarted in that way, given certain facts and circumstances, and if it were I would assume the first amendment would be applicable.

I have not had any experience with this problem. If it is as serious as you would describe it, it would certainly seem to me a problem that needs attention. I assume, Senator Hart, you are not talking about the presence in a public meeting of photographers from the news media, are you? You are talking about Government photographers.

I would assume also that you are talking about peaceful assembly rather than situations in which it has already broken into violence. 

Right. 

Right. 

If that were widespread, I would have no hesitation in saying that it would seem to me to have chilling consequences. I would be surprised

I would have to say in answer that I think it would have to depend somewhat on the citizen. I think I have known people who like publicity. But the facts you state exclude publicity. They include only surveillance by some governmental agency.

It includes, Senator, groups that would like to destroy our democratic form of government. 

Substitute a what? What type of government? 

I think the example you put is very far-removed from anything that I had in mind. The basic concept that I had in this regard, with regard to change, is that our system provides within its structure the means for peaceful change and any change that the people wish to impose or to achieve within the system is change which would be lawfully accomplished. The change that I would oppose, and there are organizations and individuals in this country who quite openly advocate this kind of change, is change without the system. They say the system no longer accommodates itself properly enough to the need for change, and I honestly disagree with those people. I believe that any change by coercion or force will in the long run be as harmful to the people who initiate it as to those who, in the beginning, may seem to be the victims. This is my basic philosophy on thisparticular subject. I think you will see it running through a good many of the talks that I have made.

Force, violence primarily. 

YOU arc describing a group which may include some who would wish to use force and others who would not wish to use force? Obviously, that presents a problem. I do not know what the clear answer would be unless I know the facts precisely, and then I would try to know. 

I was not here. I, of course, read the press accounts. I would assume, Senator Hart, that—and I had no responsibility so this is an assumption—that those in authority had to make a decision whether to allow the bridges across the river to be closed in pursuance of what wras announced as a plan to close down Washington, D.C. Now, I agree with you from what I have heard from my own young that there were masses of innocent people who were there just to watch the fun, who were swept up in procedures that certainly no lawyer would recommend normally. Nowr, what happens involves questions of degree. I myself do not know^ how^ serious the problem was, whether there were other alternatives to prevent the city from being closed in the sense that the bridges were closed. I would snj, in all candor, that I think the public authorities had a responsibility to keep the bridges and streets open. I think they had a responsibility to accomplish that with a minimum of force. I think they had a responsibility to try to accomplish it without injury to or arrest of innocent people. But in large groups of people it does appear to me that sometimes it may be difficult, particularly with large numbers of police involved, to attain all of those rather obvious objectives. 

I said a minimum of force and every effort not to implicate innocent people.

Certainly the way you put it, there is only one answer, Senator.

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator Kennedy, excuse me, sir, but I think the episode or event to which Burke Marshall referred involved representing a defendant in an unpopular cause and I have heard that he gives me credit for having done it. The fact is, I did not do it. I was perfectly willing to do it. I was not in position to act. I think I was out of town at the time and one of my partners referred him to a very competent lawyer in Richmond, named George Allen, who actually represented the individual and, I think, got him off. But he did a whole lot better than I would have done because I never practiced criminal law.

I would like to respond, Senator Kennedy. I do not know that I would say it is unfair, because one can never judge himself. I do not think my views have changed. I would say that a good deal depends, certainly in my own instance, and perhaps that of others, in terms of writing style as to what one is doing. When I write for a law review article, for example, or if I am making an address to lawyers, I will do more work in preparation, and I will be more careful in the articulation of my views than if I am asked to make a speech, say, to a lay group at a civic club luncheon or a businessmen's organization.I think the quotations that you read into the record came from my one newspaper article. I ought to know better than to write any newspaper articles from now on. I wrote that primarily on the issue of repression and I dealt in a shorthand way with some very complex issues and, as a lawyer, that is a dangerous thing for one to do.My thesis was that America, if viewed fairly, overall, is certainly not a repressive society, and I cited four or five examples. You mentioned some of them.But coming back to your point of departure, while I suppose there may be subtle changes in one's views of which one is not altogether aware, I am not conscious of any philosophical change in my own judgments from those that I have expressed when I was president of the American Bar Association, and I was very careful about what I said.

I would like to agree with you without qualification, and yet, Senator, I must say that it seems to me that one of the major contributing causes to what concerns you is a problem which has concerned me and has been the subject of several speeches that I have made since my ABA days, and this is a problem that has developed since then, and that has been the escalation of the use of coercion, force, and violence by certain groups and individuals, and this alwaysprovokes a response, and the response tends to attain the level and sometimes to exceed the level of the provocation.I became concerned about what, for lack of a more precise term, has been called the New Left movement in this country primarilyr initially in my role as a trustee. At that time I was a trustee of two colleges. The impact became very visible at the college level, as we all know, and millions of innocent people got caught up in all this, and when a few people resort to force and coercion, innocent people are not able to exercise their rights, the government responds and we have these problems which you mention. We have some of the problems which I mentioned in some of the things I wrote. I do not know whether that response is helpful but that is basically the way I look at it.

Well, the brief excerpt you read from the bulletin, which I have not seen, suggests policemen behind every bush. That would be an intolerable situation, and I do not think airybody would support that tjTpe of society. 

I would certainly think there is a responsibility on Government to try to plan to meet situations such as the one you described.

I do not recall the specific reference you make to the Richmond Bar Association talk, and yet, if I understand the thrust of your question, it relates to whether 1 would feel that some of the decisions which are designed to assure protection to the rights of persons accused of a crime are incompatible with the view I took requiring or emphasizing the desirability of having counsel in all cases involving the poor. I would see no inconsistency in that if you are talking about the views I have expressed, for example, with respect to Miranda.

The issue there was not whether counsel would be provided; it was whether, so far as X was concerned, all interrogation at the scene of a crime, for example, or the station house prior to arraignment, had to be conducted in the presence of counsel or such presence be waived consciously by the individual.Now, hero we have a judgment as to conflicting interests, society's interest on the one hand, to try to get at the facts of crime, and an accused person's interest, on the other hand, to have counsel at a fairly early stage.We wrestled with 1 His balancing of interests on the Crime Commission at great length. I forget the exact recommendation we made, but I think it was that gradually counsel should be made available at an early stage. I say gradually because there may not be enough lawyers to meet the demand. Certainly, as a minimum, there should be counsel if desired from arraignment through appeal and postconviction remedies. But again the facts and circumstances become relevant, such as in the Escobedo case where they had the man in the station house and the lawyer was sitting outside and they would not let him interview him, which as I stated, was quite outrageous.

Senator, I wrote an article published in the Washington and Lee Law Review. Actually it was the Tucker Lecture that I gave to the Washington and Lee Law School in the Spring of 1966, I think, on the subject of civil disobedience and I think that article reflects accurately the views that I had at that time and still have. It is important to understand that when I use the term "civil disobedience" in a critical sense—and this is clear from the article to which I referred—T am not talking about the testing in good faith, usually on a lawyer's advice, of specific laws deemed to be both unjust and invalid, and this was the way the civil rights movement started. The early cases, all of which were sustained in the United States Supreme Court, involved broadly speaking two types of situations, tests as to the validity of segregation laws, such as against occupying any seat you wished in a bus, and tests involving the validity of badly drawn breach of the peace or disorderly conduct laws. I have never criticized the type of civil disobedience action that brings a law of that character into the courts for testing. The type of civil disobedience that seems to me to be destructive of the very fundamentals of our society was perhaps best expressed by the man who was most often cited as the father of it in this country, and that is Thoreau. He said, in substance, that he thought the best society was one with no laws at all. Now we can sympathize with that point of view, particularly in the age in which we live where there are so many laws. And yet it is basically contrary to our system which is predicated on the rule of law, and what happened to the civil rights movement was that, with respect to civil disobedience, that concept was picked up and expanded and extended, and instead of disobedience being confined to specific laws which were sought to be tested as to their constitutionality, civil disobedience was extended to any ill or grievance against society that particular individuals might have. For example, there were people who withheld their payment of certain percentages of theirincome taxes because they did not wish any part of their taxes to be used in the Vietnam war. While I can understand that and understand and sympathize with their motive, it is perfectly obvious we would have total chaos if each of us undertakes to decide which appropriation acts of Congress were just or unjust and pays our taxes accordingly.So that broadly, in response to your question, I would say that it does seem to me that the doctrine of civil disobedience, as I have defined it and used it in the two or three occasions to which I have alluded, the definitive statement being in the Washington and Lee Law Review, is quite contrary to the rule of law in that it would allow each man to decide for himself which laws are unjust and then disobey those he regarded as unjust.

Well, I intended to make it clear that certainly in the early stages of what has been called the Civil Rights or Civil Disobedience Movement, I thought Dr. King was entirely within his rights to bring those cases, and it hardly need be said that he will be recognized as one of the great leaders of his people. Senator Kennedy, I have thought a good deal about the subject of civil disobedience because it concerned me. At the time I wrote, the only article I could find when I was doing my research on it that was at all applicable to the modern situation wras one by Burke Marshall published in the Virginia Law Review. There have been a number of discussions of it since. One that I brought with me here today and that, I think, is of interest is an essay by Archibald Cox which, I think, was published by the Harvard Press and I have no difference from former Solicitor General Cox as to his views with respect to civil disobedience. 1 have re-read the article. 1 think he expressed his views far better than I did, but in terms of the philosophic content and approach I would agree with him.

NO. This was an earlier one. This was published in 1967 by the Harvard Press. It has an essay in it by Professor Howe, and one by J. R. Wiggins who used to be managing editor of the Washington Post.

I think the subject obviously is one of great concern to the American people.I indicated before the luncheon break that I thought Congress was very wise in putting a 7-year limitation on the title III provisions of the Omnibus Crime Act. I was also glad to see that Senator McClellan has proposed an examination or investigation of this entire problem in terms of public concern.One point that I was trying to make in the article you mentioned is that there is confusion for a number of reasons, one of which is that the public generally does not understand the distinction between thewiretapping authorized by the Omnibus Crime Act and that which has been exercised up to this point by Presidential prerogative, nor do many members of the public understand that in the latter category there are two subdivisions, one involving foreign activities and the other involving domestic activities, although the two sometimes blend together.It is a very difficult thing to analyze even if one is a lawyer and has studied it, and you have studied it far more than I have. I have not had access to the statistics you mentioned.

If I may interrupt you 

I have, sir. 

I sat on the Richmond Public School Board for about 10 years; served on the State Board of Education of Virginia for 8 years. 

1950 to 1959, as I recall, January 1959. I meant 1969. 

One could hardly have picked a less peaceful time to serve on a school board. 

I suppose every man who ever served on a school board pays lip service to quality education. I think most of them, certainly those writh whom I worked, wTant to improve the overall quality of education. I have talked about it a great deal in my life. I have tried to do something about it, with what success I cannot say.I think also most people, certainly those with whom I worked, wrere anxious that the qualit}7 of education would be equal for all students, and this has been a goal, perhaps not yet attained in many States. It is a goal to which the State of Virginia is striving. I think we still have a ways to go and yet I believe in my own city, although I have not been on the local board in a long time, that a great deal has been accomplished in that respect.I will add this, if I may, we had occasion to adopt a new Constitution in Virginia—I guess it was last year, wasn't it, Senator Spong? I served on the commission which recommended that Constitution to the legislature and we added to the bill of rights of Virginia a provision which, I think, is unique enough that I would like to read it into the record, if I may. It is rot lorg.

I may say that our Bill of Rights was drawn basically by George Mason, although the Statute on Religious Freedom was drawn by Thomas Jefferson, and until we wrote the new Constitution the Jefferson statute was not incorporated directly into the Bill of Rights; it was in a separate place in the Constitution. But in any event, the provision I now wish to read relates to education, and it may be unique; we thought it was. This is in the same article that deals with the necessity to preserve free government:That free government rests, as does all progress, upon the broadest possible diffusion of knowledge and that the Commonwealth shall avail itself of those talents which nature has sown so liberally among its people by assuring the opportunities for their fullest development by an effective system of education throughout the Commonwealth.There is an education article in this new Constitution which imposes far greater authority in the State board of education than it had before. The prime authority for what happened in the public school systems, until this Constitution was adopted, lay on the local boards which were provided for by the Constitution itself; in other words, school board members were, in effect, constitutional officers. But now under the newly adopted constitution of Virginia, the State itself, the State board of education, has a far higher degree of responsibility, the view being that perhaps only in this way could we raise the general quality of education for whites and blacks throughout the State to a satisfactorjr level.In other words, we had the problem of some of the counties being very poor compared to counties that were more affluent, with the quality of schools in one county varying widely as compared to those in another county, and with different standards being applied with respect to meeting the Supreme Court tests for unitary school systems. So, perhaps, one answer to your question is that I have had some part,although a modest part, in moving Virginia forward to what I believe today is a progressive and fair policy and posture with respect to public education.

I had a hand in drafting both of them, although the principal architect of both of those was former Governor Colgate Darden, who was a colleague on the Commission. He was chairman of the Education Subcommittee but he and I had served 8 years together on the State board of education and our views had been substantially identical throughout that entire period.

Oh, yes; yes, indeed. 

Yes.

Senator Bayh, that would open up a very long story, obviously. I will try to telescope it and if there is anything I say you would like to follov. up on, of course, please do so.

All right. 

Well, at the time of Brown v. Board of Education, Virginia, as was true, I think, of every other Southern State, by its Constitution and statutes and long practice, followed the doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson. We had segregated schools, completely so. When the Brown case came down, our board—there were five people on the board, four whites and one black—resolved that we would comply with the law and we issued a little statement to that effect.We also made another decision that resulted in the record, the printed record, being fairly sparse, and that is in view of the emotional situation that began to develop, no member of the school board, white or black, would make any public speeches, and we would direct and concentrate our attention on trying to keep the public schools open until the conflict between the Federal and State law was resolved.If you will look back on it now, the situation may be hard to understand. But if one lived through those days, as Senator Spong and I did, he may have a different perspective.As you know, we had the great misfortune in Virginia for the schools to be closed in Norfolk, then the second city in the Commonwealth; the schools were also closed in Front Royal, Charlottesville, and Prince Edward County. There were strong voices in our State that wished to close the schools if there was any integration.So the task of my board, and my task as I conceived it, was to keep the schools open, and that we did. Finally they were integrated and we ran into all sorts of criticism, primarily from the whites.

NO, I did not,

Lot me come back to the preceding answer, Senator, and then I will come to the question you just asked.The Gray Commission recommendation resulted in certain laws being enacted in Virginia, and there was a long period of time when school boards were literally caught in the middle. The Brown decision had said: "Integrate these schools with all deliberate speed." The State legislature said, in effect: "All deliberate speed doesn't mean now; it means next year, or some time off in the future," so our school board did continue to operate segregated schools, as I indicated earlier, until we were finally forced by a court to integrate. I think that is the sequence—Senator Spong may be sharper in his recollection than I was—-but I remember very painfully the dilemma we were in, and the critical test in Richmond came in an oblique and indirect way when we wished to build two new high schools.It was perfectly obvious if we built them in the locations recommended by the school board, that they would become integrated in a fairly short period of time, and this is not the place to go into all the details as to the long weeks and months the board spent trying to work it out so we could obtain the necessary funds to build those schools. There were many in the community who did not want to build them.We finally obtained authorization from council at sort of a crisis meeting, at which this issue was thrashed out, and when we walked into the city council that night, I had no idea what the outcome would be. It was that close.

The final resolution was that we were authorized by resolution of council to build the schools, although there was a subsequent attempt that never reached fruition to cut oft funds, even within the city of Richmond, for any school which was integrated. Our school board had full responsibility for running the schools, but money had to be raised by the city council as we did not have the jurisdiction that some school boards have in other States of being able to make a levy in order to support public education. So we had to sell our program to city council. 

It resulted in building two high schools, one is the George Wythe High School and the other the John Marshall—two pretty good names—and I could not say because I do not remember when they became integrated. It was obvious in view of the locations, anyone familiar with my city would know, that they would be integrated, and they were integrated. 

I think it is fairly obvious that there will be cases going to the Supreme Court involving busing. 

SO I am quite conscious of the restraint that I think would be appropriate for me to exercise with respect to this subject. I would say this, though, it is fairly obvious but I will sur it nevertheless, that busing has been used in public education for many years, and I am sure it will continue to be used in public education for many years. In many instances it is a necessit}\ A particular case as to whether busing is or is not in the best interest of the children and of education, I think would have to be resolved on the facts and in light of the Supreme Court decisions. 

YOU are thinking about the problem addressed by the California court? 

It is a problem which worried us a great deal when I was on the State board of education primarily because we were more or less powerless to deal with it.

It certainly is. 

It is far more than any man deserves and I appreciate your reading it.(The letter referred to follows:)URBAN LAW INSTITUTE OF ANTIOCH COLLEGE,Washington, B.C., Novembers, 1971.

I will comment on your second question first. I know from the addresses which I have heard him deliver, as perhaps you do, Chief Justice Burger puts this subject at the top of his list of necessary reforms in the criminal justice system. I really do not know to what extent other Justices of the Court would take part in an organized effort led by the Chief Justice, but I would hope I would be on that team, if I am confirmed, to assist him in that because unless we find more effective ways of expediting the criminal justice system, in particular, the entire system could collapse. I think it is that serious. It is fairly easy to make that sort of generalization. It is not so easy to come up with any answers. Some of the problems are quite intractable, because they are rooted in our Constitution. No one wTould abandon constitutional rights in the interest of speed, and yet to cite one area in which there must be a better system developed to minimize delajs in the ending of criminal causes, I refer to the use of habeas corpus to transfer cases which have gone through the State courts into the Federal s}^stem for postconviction review. This was necessary, in my judgment, certainly with respect to most States at a time when criminal procedure and practice in those States had not really caught up with the constitutional safeguards that we are all now familiar with. The American Bar Foundation has initiated a study—there have been a good many, but none yet has produced completely satisfactory residts—an empirical study taking a State or two as examples to try to ascertain exactly what is happening with respect to the flood of habeas corpus proceedings. The criminal justice project of the American Bar Association addressed this problem and concluded that the best answer was to try to make the State processes conform to constitutional requirements, and to have records made that these constitutional requirements were, in fact, met, so that once an accusedperson had gone through the State system he would have received his constitutional rights; and, second, there would be a record of it so that there would be no occasion for Federal de novo review and starting the whole chain back through the courts.If you would move to the area of appellate practice, I think any lawyer who has been in the appellate courts will recognize that much can be done to speed appellate practice, particularly with respect to the requirements for records.My circuit, the fourth circuit, has been a leader in minimizing the requirements for records. I think a great deal more can be done. I think a great deal more can be done, perhaps, in exercising restraint in the writing of opinions by judges. At the moment I am not addressing myself to the Supreme Court; I am thinking perhaps about all courts and when one looks at the flood of cases that come into one's law library, and the feeling apparently that every judge has to write an opinion at the district court level—of course, he must make findings of the fact and conclusions of law, and sometimes a case requires an opinion—but there are many things in this broad area that can and must be done so that the entire system can be expedited.

I thank you very much, sir. 

NO, sir. I would say this, the Crime Commission did take a position on it in which I concurred in the recommendations. 

I could find it if I had the volume of the report. I have not looked at it for a long while. 

YOU do not wish any further response from me? 

I was asking Senator Hart whether he wished any response from me. 

I wish to thank the chairman and the members of the committee for this very generous opportunity to appear before you in what to me, at least, has been a very stimulating discussion. I thought all of the questions were relevant and fair, and it has been a great pleasure and privilege to be here. 

NO, I did not.Now, there seems to be a little inconsistency there with what you gentlemen have just said. Do you have anything further to say to elaborate upon this before we look into it?Mr. MAKSH. Well, yes. I certainly think that the Gray Commission proposal was, as Congressman Conyers pointed out, a way of subsidizing segregated education at public expense for those persons who did not wish an integrated education. Mr. Powell's role from 1961 until 1969 on the State board of education was to administer this tuition grant program.
