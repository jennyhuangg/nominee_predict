Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very happy to have my mother and father here, Jack and Rosemary Roberts; my sisters Kathy Godbey, Peggy Roberts, and Barbara Burke; Barbara’s husband, Tim Burke, is also here; my uncle, Richard Podrasky; and representing the cousins, my cousin, Jean Podrasky. My wife, Jane, is right here front and center, with our daughter, Josephine, and our son, Jack. You will see she has a very tight grasp on Jack. [Laughter.] 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I do. 

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and Senator Leahy, and members of the Committee.Let me begin by thanking Senators Lugar and Warner and Bayh for their warm and generous introductions.And let me reiterate my thanks to the President for nominating me. I am humbled by his confidence, and if confirmed, I will do everything I can to be worthy of the high trust he has placed in me.Let me also thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the members of the Committee for the many courtesies you have extended to me and my family over the past eight weeks. I am particularly grateful that members have been so accommodating in meeting with me personally. I have found those meetings very useful in better understanding the concerns of the Committee as the Committee undertakes its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent.I know that I would not be here today were it not for the sacrifices and help over the years of my family, who you met earlier today, friends, mentors, teachers and colleagues, many of whom are here today.Last week one of those mentors and friends, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was laid to rest. I talked last week with the nurses who helped care for him over the past year, and I was glad to hear from them that he was not a particularly good patient.[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. He chafed at the limitations they tried to impose. His dedication to duty over the past year was an inspiration to me and I know to many others. I will miss him. My personal appreciation that I owe a great debt to others reinforces my view that a certain humility should characterize the judicial role. Judges and Justices are servants of the law, not the other way around. Judges are like umpires. Umpires don’t make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire. Judges have to have the humility to recognize that they operate within a system of precedent shaped by other judges equally striving to live up to the judicial oath, and judges have to have the modesty to be open in the decisional process to the considered views of their colleagues on the bench. Mr. Chairman, when I worked in the Department of Justice in the Office of the Solicitor General, it was my job to argue cases for the United States before the Supreme Court. I always found it very moving to stand before the Justices and say, ‘‘I speak for my country.’’ But it was after I left the Department and began arguingcases against the United States, that I fully appreciated the importance of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system. Here was the United States, the most powerful entity in the world, aligned against my client, and yet all I had to do was convince the Court that I was right on the law, and the Government was wrong, and all that power and might would recede in deference to the rule of law.That is a remarkable thing. It is what we mean when we say that we are a Government of laws and not of men. It is that rule of law that protects the rights and liberties of all Americans. It is the envy of the world, because without the rule of law, any rights are meaningless.President Ronald Reagan used to speak of the Soviet Constitution, and he noted that it purported to grant wonderful rights of all sorts to people, but those rights were empty promises because that system did not have an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law and enforce those rights. We do, because of the wisdom of our Founders and the sacrifices of our heroes over the generations to make their vision a reality.Mr. Chairman, I come before the Committee with no agenda. I have no platform. Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain things in exchange for votes. I have no agenda, but I do have a commitment. If I am confirmed, I will confront every case with an open mind. I will fully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented. I will be open to the considered views of my colleagues on the bench, and I will decide every case based on the record, according to the rule of law, without fear or favor, to the best of my ability, and I will remember that it’s my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.Senators Lugar and Bayh talked of my boyhood back in Indiana. I think all of us retain from the days of our youth certain enduring images. For me those images are of the endless fields of Indiana, stretching to the horizon, punctuated only by an isolated silo or a barn. And as I grew older, those endless fields came to represent for me the limitless possibilities of our great land.Growing up, I never imagined that I would be here in this historic room, nominated to be the Chief Justice. But now that I am here, I recall those endless fields with their promise of infinite possibilities, and that memory inspires in me a very profound commitment. If I am confirmed, I will be vigilant to protect the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court, and I will work to ensure that it upholds the rule of law and safeguards those liberties that make this land one of endless possibilities for all Americans.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members of the Committee. I look forward to your questions.[The biographical information of Judge Roberts follows:]23539.00123539.00223539.00323539.00423539.00523539.00623539.00723539.00823539.00923539.01023539.01123539.01223539.01323539.01423539.01523539.01623539.01723539.01823539.01923539.02023539.02123539.02223539.02323539.02423539.02523539.02623539.02723539.02823539.02923539.03023539.03123539.03223539.03323539.03423539.03523539.03623539.03723539.03823539.03923539.04023539.04123539.04223539.04323539.04423539.04523539.04623539.04723539.04823539.04923539.05023539.05123539.05223539.05323539.05423539.05523539.05623539.05723539.05823539.05923539.06023539.06123539.06223539.06323539.06423539.06523539.06623539.06723539.06823539.06923539.07023539.07123539.07223539.07323539.07423539.07523539.07623539.07723539.07823539.07923539.08023539.08123539.082139 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would. I would point out that the principle goes back even farther than Cardozo and Frank-(141)furter. Hamilton, in Federalist No. 78, said that, ‘‘To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the judges, they need to be bound down by rules and precedents.’’ So even that far back, the Founders appreciated the role of precedent in promoting evenhandedness, predictability, stability, the appearance of integrity in the judicial process.

Well, Senator, the importance of settled expectations in the application of stare decisis is a very important consideration. That was emphasized in the Casey opinion, but also in other opinions outside that area of the law.The principles of stare decisis look at a number of factors, settled expectations one of them, as you mentioned. Whether or not particular precedents have proven to be unworkable is another consideration on the other side; whether the doctrinal bases of a decision have been eroded by subsequent developments. For example, if you have a case in which there are three precedents that lead and support that result and in the intervening period two of them have been overruled, that may be a basis for reconsidering the prior precedent.

Well, I feel the need to stay away from a discussion of particular cases. I’m happy to discuss the principles of stare decisis, and the Court has developed a series of precedents on precedent, if you will. They have a number of cases talking about how this principle should be applied. And as you emphasized, in Casey they focused on settled expectations. They also looked at the workability and the erosion of precedents. The erosion of precedent I think figured more prominently in the Court’s discussion in the Lawrence case, for example, but it is one of the factors that is looked at on the other side of the balance.

Again, I think I should stay away from discussions of particular issues that are likely to come before the Court again. And in the area of abortion, there are cases on the Court’s docket, of course. It is an issue that does come before the Court. So while I’m happy to talk about stare decisis and the importance of precedent, I don’t think I should get into the application of those principles in a particular area.

Well, in the particular case of Roe, obviously you had the Casey decision in ’92 or ’93.

’92, in which they went through the various factors in stare decisis and reaffirmed the central holding in Roe while revisiting the trimester framework and substituting the undue burden analysis with strict scrutiny. So as of ’92, you had a reaffirmation of the central holding in Roe. That decision, that application of the principles of stare decisis is, of course, itself a precedent that would be entitled to respect under those principles. 

Yes, Senator, as a general proposition. But I do feel compelled to point out that I should not, based on the precedent of prior nominees, agree or disagree with particular decisions, and I’m reluctant to do that. That’s one of the areas where I think prior nominees have drawn the line when it comes to do you agree with this case or do you agree with that case. That’s something that I’m going to have to draw the line in the— 

Well, I do think the considerations about the Court’s legitimacy are critically important. In other cases—I’m thinking of Payner v. Tennessee, for example—the Court has focused on extensive disagreement as a grounds in favor of reconsideration. In Casey, the Court looked at the disagreement as a factor in favor of reaffirming the decision. So it’s a factor that is played different ways in different precedents of the Court.I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough—and the Court has emphasized this on several occasions. It is not enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongly decided. That really doesn’t answer the question. It just poses the question. And you do look at these other factors, like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the Court, like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent developments. All of those factors go into the determination of whether to revisit a precedent under the principles of stare decisis.

An overruling of a prior precedent is a jolt to the legal system. It is inconsistent with principles of stability and yet—

I was just going to say, the principles of stare decisis recognize that there are situations when that’s a price that has to be paid. Obviously, Brown v. Board of Education is a leading example, overruling Plessy v. Ferguson, the West Coast Hotel case overruling the Lochner era decisions. Those were to a certain extent jolts to the legal system, and the arguments against them had a lot to do with stability and predictability. But the other arguments—that intervening precedents had eroded the authority of those cases, that those precedents that were overruled had proved unworkable—carried the day in those cases. 

That is the general approach when you’re considering stare decisis. It’s the notion that it’s not enough that you might think that the precedent is flawed, that there are other considerations that enter into the calculus that have to be taken into account, the values of respect for precedent, evenhandedness, predictability, stability; the considerations on the other side, whether a precedent you think may be flawed is workable or not workable, whether it’s been eroded. So to the extent that the statement is making the basic point that it’s not enough that you might think the precedent is flawed to justify revisiting it, I do agree with that. 

Well, it’s a term that hasn’t found its way into the Supreme Court opinions yet. I think—

I think one way to look at it is that the Casey decision itself, which applied the principles of stare decisis to Roe v. Wade, is itself a precedent of the Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. And that would be the body of law that any judge confronting an issue in his care would begin with, not simply the decision in Roe v. Wade but its reaffirmation in the Casey decision. That is itself a precedent. It’s a precedent on whether or not to revisit the Roe v. Wade precedent. And under principles of stare decisis, that would be where any judge considering the issue in this area would begin. 

The interesting thing, of course, is not simply the opportunity to address it, but when the Court actually considers the question. And that, of course, is in the Casey decision where it did apply the principles of stare decisis and specifically addressed it. And that I think is the decision that any judge in this area would begin with. 

Well, beyond that, it’s settled as a precedent of the Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. And those principles, applied in the Casey case, explain when cases should be revisited and when they should not. And it is settled as a precedent of the Court, yes.

I think the initial question the judge confronting an issue in this area, you don’t go straight to the Roe decision; you begin with Casey, which modified the Roe framework and reaffirmed its central holding.

I agree with that, Senator, yes. 

Well, I think people’s personal views on this issue derive from a number of sources, and there’s nothing in my personal views based on faith or other sources that would prevent me from applying the precedents of the Court faithfully under principles of stare decisis. 

Senator, I do. The right to privacy is protected under the Constitution in various ways. It’s protected by the Fourth Amendment, which provides that the right of people to be secure in their persons, houses, effects and papers is protected. It’s protected under the First Amendment, dealing with prohibition on establishment of a religion and guarantee of free exercise, protects privacy in matters of conscience. It was protected by the Framers in areas that were of particular concern to them that may not seem so significant today, the Third Amendment, protecting their homes against the quartering of troops. And in addition, the Court has, with a series of decisions going back 80 years, has recognized that personal privacy is a componentof the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. The Court has explained that the liberty protected is not limited to freedom from physical restraint, and that it’s protected not simply procedurally but as a substantive matter as well. And those decisions have sketched out over a period of 80 years certain aspects of privacy that are protected as part of the liberty in the Due Process Clause under the Constitution.

Those views reflected the Dean’s speech. If you read his speech, he’s quite skeptical of that right. I knew the Attorney General was, and I was transmitting the Dean’s speech to the Attorney General. But my views today are as I’ve just stated them.

I think that’s fair, yes. 

Well, I think those are some of the considerations the Court applied in Casey when it applied stare decisis to Roe, and those were certainly the considerations that the Chief Justice focused on in Dickerson. I doubt that his views of the underlying correctness of Miranda had changed, but it was a different question in Dickerson. It wasn’t whether Miranda was right, it was whether Miranda should be overruled at this stage, and the Chief applied and address that separate question distinct from any of his views on whether Miranda was correct or not when decided, and that’s the approach the Court follows under principles of stare decisis. 

Well, I think that gets to the application of the principles in a particular case, and based on my review of the prior transcripts of every nominee sitting on the Court today, that’s where they’ve generally declined to answer, when it gets to the application of legal principles to particular cases.I would repeat that the Court has already applied the principles of stare decisis to Roe in the Casey decision, and that stands as a precedent of the Court as well.

In the Casey decision at— 

I think in that case, the Chief’s explanation of why they weren’t going to revisit Miranda is—it persuaded, I believe, all but one member of the Court. And I’m sure it had added persuasive effect because of the Chief’s prior views on Miranda itself. It is a recognition of some of the things we’ve been talking about, the values of stare decisis. I don’t think, again, that there’s any doubt what the Chief, certainly what he thought. He told us what he thought about Miranda. I doubt that those views have changed, but there are other considerations that come into play when you’re asked to revisit a precedent of the Court, and those are the things we’ve talked about, and they’re laid out again in Dickerson and other cases of the Court. Payner v. Tennessee, for example, Agostini, a variety of decisions where the Court has explained when it will revisit a precedent and when it will not, and of course the decisions come out both ways. In Payne v. Tennessee the Court went through the analyses. It was a case about whether victims could testify at sentencing. The precedent said no, and they overruled those. 

I’d agree that the tradition of liberty is a living thing, yes. 

I was asked frequently by other partners to help out particularly in my area of expertise, often involved moot courting, and I never turned down a request. I think it’s right that if it had been something morally objectionable, I suppose I would have, but it was my view that lawyers don’t stand in the shoes of their clients, and that good lawyers can give advice and argue any side of a case. And as I said, I was asked frequently to participate in that type of assistance for other partners at the firm, and I never turned anyone down.

Morning. 

Well, Senator, I don’t want to answer a particular hypothetical that could come before the Court, but I’m happy to comment on the memorandum that you’re discussing.

Well, Senator, that issue and similar issues have in fact come up. There were, for example, lawsuits concerning the legality of the war in Vietnam, various efforts, and certainly the arguments would be made on the other side about the President’s authority, and that may well come before the Court.

Right. 

No, Senator, I’m not. What I’m saying is that that issue or issues related to that could well come before the Court, and that’s why I have to resist answering your particular hypothetical question. The memo you refer to, I was working in the White House Counsel’s Office then. The White House Counsel’s office is charged to be vigilant to protect the Executive’s authority. Just as you have lawyers here in the Senate and the House has lawyers who are experts and charged with being vigilant to protect the prerogatives of the legislative branch. I believe very strongly in the separation of powers. That was a very important principle that the Framers set forth that is very protective of our individual liberty. It makes sure the legislative branch legislates, the Executive executes, and the judicial branch decides the law. And it makes—it was part of the Framers’ vision that each of the branches would be to a certain extent jealous of what they regarded as their prerogatives, and to the extent there is a disputebetween the legislative branch and the executive branch, it’s the job, of course, of the judicial branch to resolve that dispute.

With respect, Senator, you’re vastly over-reading the memorandum. It concerned—

Well, because it had nothing to do with terminating hostilities. It had to do with the eligibility for certain pension benefits, and the question then was whether or not—who should be determining when the hostilities ceased or should cease—and there again, a lawyer for the executive branch, not a judge who would be considering the issue in an entirely different light, but a lawyer for the executive branch—a careful lawyer would say there may be a problem there. Are we conceding anything by saying the legislature gets to determine when the hostilities end? 

Well, with respect, Senator— 

With respect, Senator, the memorandum is about legislation for—if I’m remembering it correctly, it was 20 some years ago—pension benefits or certain additional pay benefits. That’s what it was about. And I suspect if you asked any lawyer for any President of any administration whether they wanted to concede that general principle, or if as careful lawyers they would prefer that that provision were rewritten or not in there, I’m fairly confident that regardless of the administration, that a lawyer for the Executive would take the same position. Now, I am also fairly confident that one of your lawyers here in the Senate would take the opposite position. 

Of course. The Constitution specifically gives that power to Congress. 

Congress certainly has the power of the purse, and that’s the way, as you noted earlier, that Congress has typically exercised its— 

Senator, that’s a question that I don’t think can be answered in the abstract. You need to know the particular circumstances and exactly what the facts are and what the legislation would be like, because the argument on the other side—and as a judge, I would obviously be in a position of considering both arguments, the argument for the Legislature and the argument for the Executive. The argument on the Executive side will rely on authority as Commander in Chief, and whatever authorities derive from that. So it’s not something that can be answered in the abstract.

Senator, I believe that no one is above the law under our system, and that includes the President. The President is fully bound by the law, the Constitution and statutes. Now, there often arise issues where there’s a conflict between the Legislature and the Executive over an exercise of Executive authority, asserted Executive authority. The framework for analyzing that is in the Youngstown Sheet and Tube case, the famous case coming out of President Truman’s seizure of the steel mills.

Exactly. And the framework that was set forth in Justice Jackson’s concurring opinion, which is the opinion that has sort of set the stage for subsequent cases, analyzes the issues in terms of one of three categories: if the President is acting in an area where Congress is supportive, expressly supportive of his action, the President’s power is at its maximum; if the President isacting in an area such as you postulate under the Bybee memo, where the President is acting contrary to congressional authority; what Justice Jackson said is the President’s authority is at its lowest ebb, it consists solely of his authority under the Constitution, less whatever authority Congress has; and then, of course, there’s the vast middle area where courts often have to struggle because they can’t determine whether Congress has supported a particular exercise or not. The Dames & Moore case, for example, is a good example of that.

I was just going to say the first issue for a Court confronting the question you posed would be whether Congress specifically intended to address the question of the President’s exercise of authority or not. 

I think the approach in the case is one that has guided the Court in this area since 1954 or 1952, whatever it was. 

Youngstown is a very important case in a number of respects, not least the fact that the opinion that everyone looks to, the Jackson opinion, was by Justice Jackson, who was of course FDR’s Attorney General, and certainly a proponent of expansive Executive powers. 

He is for a number of reasons. What’s significant about that aspect of his career, is here is someone whose job it was to promote and defend an expansive view of Executive power as Attorney General, which he did very effectively, and then when he went on the Court, as you can tell from his decision in Youngstown, he took an entirely different view of a lot of issues, in one famous case even disagreeing with one of his own prior opinions, and wrote a long opinion about how he can’t believe he once held those views. I think it’s very important that— 

Well, I’m just saying one reason people admire Justice Jackson so much is that although he had strong views as Attorney General, he recognized, when he became a member of the Supreme Court, that his job had changed, and he was not the President’s lawyer, he was not the chief lawyer in the executive branch, he was a Justice sitting in review of some of the decisions of the Executive. And he took a different perspective. And that’s, again, one reason many admire him, including myself.

Certainly, Senator. The point that Justice Jackson is making there is that the Constitution vests pertinent authority in these areas in both branches. The President is the Commander in Chief, and that meant something to the Founders. On the other hand, as you just quoted, Congress has the authority to issue regulations governing the Armed Forces, another express provision in the Constitution. Those two can conflict if by making regulations for the Armed Forces, Congress does something that interferes with, in the President’s view, his command authority, and in some cases those disputes will be resolved in Court, as they were in the Youngstown case.

The internment of a group solely on the basis of their—

I suppose a case like that could come before the Court. I would be surprised to see it, and I would be surprised if there were any arguments that could support it.

I do, Senator. I read the Chief’s book that you quoted from, and for someone who sits on the court that I sit on now, we famously look back to one of the first cases decided in the D.C. Circuit. It was the Aaron Burr trial, and it’s, if anything, a motto—

Well, it’s sort of the motto of our court, an opinion that was written out of that, in which the judge explained that it was our obligation to calmly poise the scales of justice in dangerous times as well as calm times. That’s a paraphrase, but the phrase, calmly poise the scales of justice if, if anything, the motto of the court on which I now sit. That would be the guiding principle for me whether I am back on that court or a different one, because some factors may be different, the issues may be different, the demands may be different, but the Bill of Rights remains the same. And the obligation of a court to protect those basic liberties in times of peace and in times of war, in times of stress and in times of calm, that doesn’t change. 

Well, one thing I would tell them to do is read the rest of the Duke Law Journal article, because one thing it makes—point it makes is that environmental interests, it goes on to say aesthetic interests, those are all protected under the law, and that one reason courts should insist that those who bring suit have standing—that’s the issue—that are actually injured, is because standing can encompass certainly environmental harms. The issue that was being addressed in the Duke Law Journal article was whether anyone could bring a lawsuit just because they are interested in the issue, or whether the plaintiffs had to show that they had been injured. In other words, in your hypothetical, the people who are downstream from the mercury pollution, they will be able to show that they are injured and can bring suit.The question is whether somebody halfway across the country who’s not injured by that act should be able to bring suit. That was the issue in the—

Well, it certainly is a precedent of the Court that I would apply under principles of stare decisis. The Government’s position in that case, of course, in no way condoned the activities involved. The issue was an open one. The courts of appeals had ruled the same way that the Government had argued before the Supreme Court, and it arose because we were dealing with an implied right of action, in other words, right of action under the statute that courts had implied. The reason that there was difficulty in determining exactly what remedies were available is because Congress had not addressed that question. The remedies that were available, as we explained, included issues such as restitu-tion, back pay, injunctive relief, and the open issue, again, was whether damages were available. The Supreme Court issued its ruling and cleared that up.

Well, I don’t want to say— 

It is a solid—it’s a precedent of the Court. It was, as you say, a unanimous precedent. It concerned an issue of statutory interpretation because it was unclear whether Congress had intended a particular remedy to be available or not. That was the question before the Court. The court of appeals had ruled one way. The Supreme Court ruled the other way. The administration’s position was based on the principle that the decision about the remedy of back pay was a decision that should be made by Congress and not the Court. The Court saw the case the other, and that issue is now settled, and those damages actions are brought in courts around the country. 

Senator, there— 

No, Senator. Again, there was no issue in the case about condoning the behavior. I found it abhorrent then. I find it abhorrent now. That’s not the issue. The issue in the case is did Congress intend for this particular remedy to be available? Other remedies were available under the provision at issue, and the question is, was this remedy available? 

Restitution and injunction to prohibit the harmful activity. Again, the issue arose because Congress had not spelled out whether there was a right of action in the first place or what the components of that right of action should be. The issue— 

Thank you so much. 

Well, I haven’t—I didn’t have a chance to read Professor Sunstein’s book. He writes a different one every week, it’s hard to keep up with. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. But, you know, I think— 

Like most people, I resist the labels. I have told people when pressed that I prefer to be known as a modest judge, and to me that means some of the things that you talked about in those other labels. It means an appreciation that the role of the judge is limited, that a judge is to decide the cases before them, they’re not to legislate, they’re not to execute the laws. Another part of that humility has to do with respect for precedent that forms part of the rule of law that the judge is obligated to apply under principles of stare decisis. Part of that modesty has to do with being open to the considered views of your colleagues on the bench. I would say that’s one of the things I’ve learned the most in the past 2 years on the court of appeals, how valuable it is to function in a collegial way with your colleagues on the bench, other judges being open to your views, you being open to theirs. They, after all, are in the same position you’re in. They’ve read the same briefs. They heard the same arguments. They’ve looked at the same cases. And if they’re seeing things in a very different way, you need to be open to that and try to take another look at your view and make sure that you’re on solid ground. Now, I think that general approach results in a modest approach to judging which is good for the legal system as a whole. I don’t think the courts should have a dominant role in society and stressing society’s problems. It is their job to say what the law is. That’s what Chief Justice Marshall said, of course, in Marbury v. Madison. And, yes, there will be times when either the executive branch or the legislative branch exceeds the limits of their powers under the Constitution or transgresses one of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, and then it is emphatically the obligation of the courts to step up and say what the Constitution provides, and to strike down either unconstitutional legislation or unconstitutional Executive action. But the Court has to appreciate that the reason they have that authority is because they’re interpreting the law, they’re not making policy, and to the extent they go beyond their confined limits and make policy or execute the law, they lose their legitimacy, and I think that calls into question the authority they will need when it’s necessary to act in the face of unconstitutional action. 

Well, I have said I do not have an overarching judicial philosophy that I bring to every case, and I think that’s true. I tend to look at the cases from the bottom up rather than the top down. And like I think all good judges focus a lot on the facts. We talk about the law, and that’s a great interest for all of us, but I think most cases turn on the facts, so you do have to know those, you have to know the record.In terms of the application of the law, you begin obviously with the precedents before you. There are some cases where everybody’s going to be a literalist. If the phrase in the Constitution says twothirds of the Senate, everybody’s a literalist when they interpret that. Other phrases in the Constitution are broader, ‘‘unreasonable searches and seizures.’’ You can look at that wording all day and it’s not going to give you much progress in deciding whether a particular search is reasonable or not. You have to begin looking at the cases and the precedents, what the Framers had in mind when they drafted that provision.So, yes, it does depend upon the nature of the case before you I think.

That’s what the joint opinion of the three Justices said, it was reaffirming the central holding, it revisited and altered the framework.

Well, the plurality opinion is regarded I think as the opinion of—it’s the opinion of the plurality, but as the leading opinion of the Justices of the majority, it’s the one that judges look to in the first instance. There were separate opinions that disagreed with some of the ways in which that plurality revisited Roe. It reaffirmed the central holding in Roe v. Wade. It dispensed with the trimester framework, and it substituted for the strict scrutinythat Roe had established the undue burden analysis that since the time of Casey has governed in this area.

Well, the question of the workability of the framework is I think one of the main considerations that you look to under principles of stare decisis, along with the settled expectations, whether a precedent has been eroded. That was one of the factors that the Court looked at in Casey in determining I think to alter the framework of Roe, the trimester framework and the strict scrutiny approach, at least in the terms that were applied by the joint opinion.

That was his view, yes. 

Based on his published opinions—now, I don’t remember—well, certainly he wrote in Casey, I don’t know if he’s written since then, so I just hesitate to ascribe views from 1992 to current. 

Well, Justice White’s insight that was quoted by Senator DeWine yesterday, that judges’ obligation is to decide cases, really has constitutional significance. It goes back to Marbury v. Madison. You know, the Constitution doesn’t have any provision that says, oh, and the judges, by the way, are to interpret the Constitution and tell us what it means. What it says it that the judges are to decide cases that arise under this Constitution, this new Constitution, and under any new laws that the Congress might pass. And what Chief Justice Marshall explained in Marbury v. Madison was that, well, if we’ve got to decide cases, that’s our constitutional obligation, we’ve got to decide whether in a particular case something’s consistent with the Constitution or not. So we have to decide what the Constitution means, and that’s what the Framers intended.So the obligation to decide cases is the only basis for the authority to interpret the Constitution and laws. That means that judges should be careful in making sure that they have a real case in front of them, a real live dispute between parties who have actual injury involved, actual interests at stake, because that is the basis for their legitimacy. And then they’re to decide that case as a judge would, not as a legislator would based on any view of what’s the best policy, but as a judge would based on the law. That’s why the Framers were willing to have the judges decide cases that required them to interpret the Constitution, because they were going to decide it according to the rule of law.If the people who framed our Constitution were jealous of their freedom and liberty, they would not have sat around and said, ‘‘Let’s take all the hard issues and give them over to the judges.’’ That would have been the furthest thing from their mind. Now, judges have to decide hard questions when they come up in the context of a particular case. That’s their obligation. But they have to decide those questions according to the rule of law, not their own social preferences, not their policy views, not their personal preferences, according to the rule of law.

I will certainly make every effort to do so, Senator. I appreciate the point that in some cases the question of whether you are interpreting the law or making the law, that that line is hard to draw in some cases. I would say not in most cases. I think most cases, most judges, know what it means to interpret the law, and can recognize when they’re going too far into an area of making law, but certainly there are harder cases. And someone like Justice Harlan always used to explain that when you get to those hard cases, you do need to focus again on the question of legitimacy, and make sure that this is the question that you the judge are supposed to be deciding rather than someone else.You go to a case like the Lochner case. You can read that opinion today and it’s quite clear that they’re not interpreting the law, they’re making the law. The judgment is right there. They say: We don’t think it’s too much for a baker to work whatever it was, 13 hours a day. We think the legislature made a mistake in saying they should regulate this for their health. We don’t think it hurts their health at all.It’s right there in the opinion. You can look at that and see that they are substituting their judgment on a policy matter for what the legislature had said. So, you know, the fact that it’s difficult to draw the line doesn’t relieve a judge of an obligation to draw the line.There are those more academic theorists who say it is a question of degree, and since it’s just a question of degree, you shouldn’t try to draw the line, because it’s hard sometimes to interpret the law without making the law. We’ll throw our hands up and say, well, judges make the law, and proceed from that.That has not been my experience either as a judge or an advocate. My experience has been in most cases you can see where the line is, and you do know when judges are exceeding their authority and making a law, rather than interpreting it, and careful judges are always vigilant to make sure that they’re adhering to their proper function and not going into the legislative area.

Well, I guess the first thing I would say is look at—begin with my opinions as a judge over the past 2 years on the court of appeals. I think they show a healthy regard for the prerogatives of the legislative branch that is appropriate. It is certainly— as an advocate, I’ve certainly been arguing deference to the legislature in appropriate cases. Other cases of course I was on a different side in arguing the opposite, so I’m familiar with the arguments. I have not only been in a position where I’ve been pressing arguments, for example, for the executive branch. I have been arguing cases against the executive branch, and frequently arguing cases for the proposition of deference in favor of the Legislature.I guess I would just hearken back to the model I was talking about earlier of Justice Jackson, who went from being FDR’s Attorney General to being a Justice on the Court who I think always had a healthy regard for the prerogatives of the legislative branch.

Yes. 

The Court has frequently explained that stare decisis is strongest when you’re dealing with a statutory decision. The theory is a very straightforward one that if the Court gets it wrong, Congress can fix it. And the Constitution, the Court has explained, is different. Obviously, short of amendment, only the Court can fix the constitutional precedents. 

There are different limits, of course, but, yes, the limits in the Constitution on Congress are as important as limitations on State legislatures in the Constitution. 

Well, the obligation to say what the law is, including determining that particular legislation is unconstitutional, is, as Chief Justice Marshall said, emphatically the duty and province of the judicial branch. You and I can agree or disagree on whether the Court is right in a particular case, but if the Court strikes down an Act of Congress and it’s wrong, the Court shouldn’t have done that, that’s not an act of judicial activism, it’s just being wrong.The obligation to strike down legislation is with the judicial branch. They need—I think as Justice Holmes said, it’s the gravest and most delicate duty that the Court performs, and the reason is obvious. All judges are acutely aware of the fact that millions and millions of people have voted for you and not one has voted for any of us. That means that you have the responsibility of representing the policy preferences of the people making the determination about when legislation is necessary and appropriate and what form that legislation should take.Our job is a very different one. We have to consider cases that raise the question from time to time whether particular legislation is constitutional, and we have to limit ourselves in doing that to applying the law and not in any way substituting ourselves for the policy choices you’ve made. But it is not, as I would say, it’s not judicial activism when the courts do that. They may be right or they’re wrong, and if they’re wrong, they’re wrong, but it’s not activism.

Yes, Senator. If I am confirmed, I would hope to do that, and if I’m not, I would hope to do that back on the court of appeals. I think it’s a very important part of a lawyer’s obligation. I’ll mention just a couple of examples.I handled an appeal here before the D.C. court of appeals on behalf of a class of welfare recipients who had had their benefits cut off. Our position was that the benefits had been cut off in violation of the Constitution, in violation of their due process rights to notice and an individualized hearing. These were the neediest people in the District and we pressed their argument before the court of appeals.The first case I argued in the Supreme Court was a pro bono matter for an individual with a double jeopardy claim against the United States, again, someone who didn’t have a lawyer, and I was very happy to do that.And as I said earlier, I regularly handled moot courts for people. I did one for minority plaintiffs in a voting rights case out of Louisiana. I did one challenging environmental effects in Glacier Bay and another one in the Grand Canyon.In addition to those actually involving a case, one of the pro bono activities that I’m most committed to is a program sponsored by the Supreme Court Historical Society and an organization called Street Law. They bring high school teachers to D.C. every summer to teach them about the Supreme Court and they can then go back and teach the Court in their classes, and I’ve always found that very, very fulfilling.

I do. 

Yes. 

Yes. That was the—represented a lot of work by Chief Justice Earl Warren, because my understanding of the history is that it initially was not and he spent—it was reargued. He spent a considerable amount of time talking to his colleagues and bringing them around to the point where they ended up with a unanimous Court. 

I’m sure. 

Certainly, Senator. The importance of the Court’s approach in Brown is, of course, to recognize that the issue was whether or not the discrimination violated equal protection, and you have to look at the discrimination in the context in which it is occurring. I know there has been a lot of recent academic research into this, the original intent of the drafters of the 14th Amendment. Professor McConnell’s piece suggests that it’s perfectly consistent with the conclusion in Brown, and it also, for the very point you mentioned, was an important one, that the nature of the institution of public education wasn’t formed to the same extent at the time of the drafting—

Well, the reasoning, though, I think it’s important, is focused on the effects, yes, but the conclusion was that they didn’t care if the effects were equal. In other words, the genius of the decision was the recognition that the act of separating the students was where the violation was and it rejected the defense, certainly just a theoretical one given the actual record, that you could have equal facilities and equal treatment. I think the conclusion, if the record had shown—which it did not—if it had shown perfectly equal treatment in the AfricanAmerican school and in the white school, then Chief Justice Warren’s analysis would be the same because the act of separation is what constituted the discrimination. 

I don’t think any issue has been raised concerning those. You know, I’m cautious, of course, about expressing an opinion on a matter that might come before the Court. I don’t think that’s one that’s likely to come before the Court, so I’m not aware of any questions that have been raised concerning that, Senator.

That’s an issue, of course, as you know, it’s up for renewal and that is a question that could come before the Court. The question of Congress’s power, again, without expressing any views on it, I do know that it’s going to be—

Yes, and the issue would be— 

Oh, well, the existing Voting Rights Act, the constitutionality has been upheld— 

Well, I’m not aware of any constitutional issue that’s been raised about it. 

But again, I don’t want to express conclusions on hypothetical questions, whether as applied in a particular case, whether there would be a challenge in that respect. Those cases come up all the time— 

My hesitancy, Senator, is simply this, that cases do come up—I had one in the D.C. Circuit—concerning issues under the Voting Rights Act—

Again, I think that my understanding is it’s been upheld and I’m not aware of any issues that are arising under it. I suppose if there’s a particular claim that’s entered under that statute, litigants make all sorts of arguments and they may raise an argument that it’s unconstitutional as applied in a particular case and the court would have to decide that question. 

It is preservative, I think, of all the other rights. Without access to the ballot box, people are not in the position to protect any other rights that are important to them. And so I think it’s one of, as you said, the most precious rights we have as Americans.

Senator, you will recall at the time of the—this was 23 years ago. I was a staff lawyer in the Justice Department. It was the position of the Reagan administration for whom I worked, the position of the Attorney General for whom I worked, that the Voting Rights Act should be extended for the longest period of its extension in history without change. The Supreme Court had interpreted in the Mobile v. Bolden case, Section 2 to have an intent test, not an effects test.Keep in mind, of course, as you know very well, Section 5, the pre-clearance provision, had always had an effects test, and that would be continued. The reference to discrimination nationwide was addressing the particular point that the effects test had been applied in particular jurisdictions that had a history of discrimination and the question is whether or not there was a similar history of discrimination that supported extending the effects test in Section 2.It was the position of the administration for which I worked that the proposal was to extend the Voting Rights Act without change. Your position at the time was that the intent test that the Supreme Court had determined was in Section 2 should be changed to the effects test, and that was the position that eventually prevailed.There was no disagreement— 

Senator— 

Well, Senator, you disagree— 

Well, this is the same debate that took place 23 years ago on this very same issue, and the administration’s position—you think the Supreme Court got it wrong in Mobile v. Bolden. 

Well, and the Supreme Court— 

The point is, and again, this is revisiting a debate that took place 23 years ago—

Certainly. And the only point I would make, this is the same disagreement and the same debate that took place then over whether the Court was right or wrong in Mobile v. Bolden, and the point I would make is two-fold, that those like President Reagan, like Attorney General Smith, who were advocating extension of the Voting Rights Act without change, were as fully committed to protecting the right to vote as anyone.

And the articulation of views that you read from represented my effort to articulate the views of the administration and the position of the administration for whom I worked, for which I worked, 23 years ago. 

I certainly— 

I certainly agreed that the Voting Rights Act should be extended. I certainly agreed that the effects test in Section 5 should be extended. We had argued that the intent test— that the Supreme Court recognized in Mobile v. Bolden—I know you think it was wrong, but that was the Supreme Court’s interpretation—should have been extended. Again, as you said, the compromise that you and Senator Dole worked out was enacted into law and signed into law by President Reagan and the Voting Rights Act has continued to be an important legislative tool to ensure that most precious of rights which is preservative of all other rights. There was never any dispute about that basic proposition. 

Well, I think the legislative debate between those who favored extending the Voting Rights Act as is and those who favored changing the Act because they disagreed with the Supreme Court decisions, the legislative judgment was that the administration’s proposal didn’t succeed because they had waited— rather than coming out in favor of an extension right away, they waited for the Congress to come up with its proposals which turned out to be different than the administration proposals. On the housing discrimination, I would note that the administration did get its ducks in a row, and in a matter of months after the date of the memo that you just read from had its housing proposal there and submitted to Congress and it was enacted. 

The administration’s proposal was submitted, I believe, months after the date of the memo that you read from.

No, Senator, and I did not back then. You have not accurately represented my position.

Senator, with respect— 

Senator, you did not accurately represent my position. The Grove City College case presented two separate questions, and it was a matter being litigated, of course, in the courts. The universities were arguing that they were not covered at all by the civil rights laws in question simply because their students had Federal financial assistance and attended their universities. That was their first argument. The second argument was, even if they were covered, all that was covered was the admissions office and not other programs that themselves did not receive separate financial assistance. Our position, the position of the administration—and, again, that was the position I was advancing. I was not formulating policy. I was articulating and defending the administration position. And the administration’s position was, yes, you are covered if the students receive Federal financial assistance, and that the coverage extended to the admissions office. That was the position that the Supreme Court agreed with. We were interpreting legislation. The question is: What is the correct interpretation of the legislation? The position that the administration advanced was the one I have just described. The universities were covered due to Federal financial assistance to their students. It extended to the admissions office. The Supreme Court in the Grove City case agreed with that position. So the position the administration had articulated, the Supreme Court concluded, was a correct interpretation of what this body, the Congress, had enacted. Congress then changed the position about coverage, and that position was, I believe, signed into law by the President and that became the new law. The memo you read about Secretary Bell’s proposal, if I remember it, was, well, he said, if we’re going to cover all of the universities, then we shouldn’t hinge coverage simply on Federal financial assistance. And the position I took in the memorandum was that, no, we should not revisit that question. We should not revisit the question that Federal financial assistance triggers coverage. 

Well, Senator, again, the administration policy was as I articulated it, and it was my job to articulate the administration policy.

I know I agree with it. Now let me figure out what he meant by it.[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I think what he meant was that judges operate as judges when they are confined by the law. When I became a lawyer, the proclamation they read for the graduates, they referred to the law as ‘‘the wise restraints that make men free.’’ And judges are the same way. We don’t turn a matter over to a judge because we want his view about what the best idea is, what the best solution is. It’s because we want him or her to apply the law. They are constrained when they do that. They are constrained by the words that you choose to enact into law in interpreting the law. They are constrained by the words of the Constitution. They are constrained by the precedents of other judges that become part of the rule of law that they must apply. And that cabining of their discretion, that is what Hamilton referred to in Federalist 78. He said judges should not have an absolute discretion; they need to be bound downby rules and precedents—the rules, the laws that you pass, the precedents that judges before them have shaped. And then their job is interpreting the law. It is not making the law. And so long as they are being confined by the laws, by the Constitution, by the precedents, then you’re more comfortable that you’re exercising the judicial function. It’s when you’re at sea and you don’t have anything to look to that you need to begin to worry that this isn’t what judges are supposed to do.

No, I don’t think there is. Sometimes it’s hard to give meaning to a constitutional term in a particular case. But you don’t look to your own values and beliefs. You look outside yourself to other sources. This is the basis for, you know, that judges wear black robes, because it doesn’t matter who they are as individuals. That’s not going to shape their decision. It’s their understanding of the law that will shape their decision.

I have said that it is not the job of the Court to solve society’s problems, and I believe that. It is the job of the Court to decide particular cases. Now, sometimes cases are brought and the courts have to decide them even though the other branches have been slow to act, as you say. Brown v. Board of Education is a good example. The other branches and society were not addressing the problems of segregation in the schools. They were not just slow to act. They weren’t acting. But that didn’t mean the courts should step in and act. But when the courts were presented with a case that presented the challenge, this segregation violates the Equal Protection Clause, the courts did have the obligation to decide that case and resolve it, and in the course of doing that, of course, change the course of American history.

Again, it is the obligation of the courts to decide particular cases. Often that means acting on the side of justice as we understand it, enforcing the Bill of Rights, enforcing the Equal Protection Clause. But it has to be in the context of a case, and it has to be in the context of interpreting a provision that’s implicated in that case. They don’t have a license to go out and decide I think this is an injustice and so I’m going to do something to fix it. That type of judicial role I think is inconsistent with the role the Framers intended. When they have to decide a case, it may well from time to time in particular cases put them in the role of vindicating the vision of justice that the Framers enacted in the Constitution, and that is a legitimate role for them. But it’s always in the context of deciding a proper case that’s been presented.

Well, I don’t want to directly comment on what Justice Souter said. He’s either going to be a colleague or continue to be one of my bosses.[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. So I want to maintain good relations in either case. But I do think it’s important to recognize in construing legislation that sometimes a decision has been made not to address a particular problem. That isn’t a license for the courts to go ahead and address it because that would be overriding a congressional decision. At the same time, as is always the case, courts are sometimes put in the position of having to decide a question that Congress has left deliberately or inadvertently unanswered. We see that in the issue of what remedies are available under an implied right of action when Congress has not spelled them out and the courts sometimes have to address that sort of question. And if it’s presented in a case, it’s unavoidable. But, again, I resort back to the bedrock principle of legitimacy in the American system for courts, which is that any authority to interpret the law, any authority to interpret the Constitution, derives from the obligation to decide a particular case or controversy. 

Well, President Lincoln, of course, was referring to one of the—perhaps the most egregious examples of judicial activism in our history, the Dred Scott case, in which the Court went far beyond what was necessary to decide the case, and really, I think historians would say that the Supreme Court tried to put itself in the position of resolving the dispute about the extension of slavery, and resolving it in a particular way that it thought was best for the Nation. And we saw what disastrous consequences flowed from that. And Lincoln’s comment about it—and he had several comments, because even when he was running for Senate, a big part of the famous debates were, well, this is what the Supreme Court has said, are you going to follow it or not? And Lincoln was a very careful lawyer in his responses. And the reason it was such a problem is because he was dealing with such an overarching Supreme Court decision. They didn’t even just decide the particular case. The Court decided to take upon itself, opining more generally on how the whole issue should be resolved. And, of course, as I said, it was a disaster.So, yes, to the extent Lincoln’s criticism is how broad and overreaching the Court opinion was and that that in itself presented a very difficult problem in terms of adherence to the decision, I do agree with that.

Certainly, and here, again, we’re guided by the Court. It has precedent on precedents. It has cases talking about when you should revisit prior precedents and when you shouldn’t. And, of course, some of the cases say you should in the particular instance and others that you shouldn’t. You begin with a basic recognition of the value of precedent. No judge gets up every morning with a clean slate and says, well, what should the Constitution look like today? The approach is a more modest one. You begin with the precedents. Adherence to precedent promotes evenhandedness, promotes fairness, promotes stability and predictability. And those are very important values in a legal system. Those precedents become part of the rule of law that the judge must apply.At the same time, as the Court pointed out in the Casey case, stare decisis is not an inexorable command. If particular precedents have proven to be unworkable, they don’t lead to predictable results, they’re difficult to apply, that’s one factor supporting reconsideration. If the bases of the precedents have been eroded—in other words, if the Court decides a case saying because of these three precedents we reach this result, and in the intervening years two of those are overruled, that’s another basis for reconsidering the precedent.At the same time, you always have to take into account the settled expectations that have grown up around the prior precedent. It is a jolt to the legal system to overrule a precedent, and that hasto be taken into account, as well as the different expectations that have grown up around it.There are different other aspects of the rules. For example, property decisions are far less likely to be reconsidered because of the expectations that grow up around them. Statutory decisions are less likely to be reconsidered because Congress can fix it if it’s a mistake.Again, the Court’s decisions in cases like Casey and Dickerson, Payner v. Tennessee, and Agostini, State Oil Company v. Khan, it’s an issue that comes up on a regular basis, and the Court has developed a body of law that would guide judges and Justices when they decide whether to revisit a case.The fundamental proposition is that it is not sufficient to view the prior case as wrongly decided. That’s the opening of the process, not the end of the process. You have to decide whether it should be revisited in light of all these considerations.

Well, again, you would start with the precedents of the Court on that decision. In other words, if you think the decision was correctly decided or wrongly decided, that doesn’t answer the question of whether or not it should be revisited. You do have to look at whether or not the decision has led to a workable rule. You have to consider whether it’s created settled expectations that should not be disrupted in the interest of regularity in the legal system. You do have to look at whether or not the bases of the precedent have been eroded. Those are the main considerations that the Court has articulated in a case like Dickerson, Payner v. Tennessee, and the others. These are all the factors that the Court looks at.Obviously, a view about the case presents the question, but the Court has emphasized it’s not enough to think that the decision is wrong to take the next step to revisit it and overrule.

Well, I think it’s very important to define these terms. Let’s take ‘‘the originalist approach.’’ I do think it’s the— that the Framers’ intent is the guiding principle that should apply. However, you do need to be very careful and make sure that you’re giving appropriate weight to the words that the Framers used to embody their intent.I think in particular of the 14th Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause. There are some who may think they’re being originalists who will tell you, well, the problem they were getting at were the rights of the newly freed slaves, and so that’s all that the Equal Protection Clause applies to. But, in fact, they didn’t write the Equal Protection Clause in such narrow terms. They wrote more generally. That may have been a particular problem motivating them, but they chose to use broader terms, and we should take them at their word, so that it is perfectly appropriate to apply the Equal Protection Clause to issues of gender and other types of discrimination beyond the racial discrimination that was obviously the driving force behind it. That is an originalist view because you’re looking at the original intent as expressed in the words that they chose, and their intent was to use broad language, not to use narrow language.There are some areas where a very strict textualist approach makes the most sense. Obviously, the example I gave earlier, twothirds means two-thirds. You don’t say, well, their purpose was to apply some super-majority requirement, and now that we have more Senators, three-fifths will give effect to that intent. Nobody would apply that approach. You stick to the language.In other areas, the Court’s precedents dictate the approach. This is not something that is purely a matter of academic exercise. For example, on the Seventh Amendment, the right to a jury trial, the Court has been very specific. We have a historical approach there. The job of a judge is to sort of look at whatever action is and try to analogize it. What would that be most like in 1787? And if you got a jury trial for that, you get one today; and if you didn’t, you don’t. It’s a purely historical approach.So the approaches do vary, and I don’t have an overarching view. As a matter of fact, I don’t think very many judges do. I think a lot of academics do. But the demands of deciding cases and the demands of deciding cases by committee, either a group of three or a group of nine, I find with those demands the nuances of academic theory are dispensed with fairly quickly, and judges take a more practical and pragmatic approach to trying to reach the best decision consistent with the rule of law.

The issue was the—in the Grove City case, the Court had said that receipt of financial aid by students triggered coverage under the civil rights statutes, limited to the admissions office, the admissions policies. The Civil Rights Restoration Act changed that result to say that the limitation was not to the admissions office but applied more generally to the institution.Secretary Bell submitted a proposal. He said, well, if it’s going to apply more generally to the institution, then the trigger of simply having students who receive financial aid shouldn’t be enough. And the position that we took in response to Secretary Bell’s proposal was no, that we weren’t going to revisit it. We had argued earlier in Grove City that financial aid was enough to trigger coverage and we weren’t going to revisit that question. The position was that coverage of the entire institution based on receipt of financial aid was appropriate.

Well, it’s, again, 23-some years ago. But my recollection is that that was his proposal. Our response was that, no, we’re not going to do that, we’re not going to change the position we’ve taken in light of the new legislation.

Well, President Reagan’s policy and the Attorney General’s policy was to support the longest extension of the Voting Rights Act in history without change. Some in the Congress wanted to amend the Voting Rights Act Section 2 to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Mobile v. Bolden. And that’s what the debate was about, whether it should be an intent test under Section 2 or an effects test. Everybody agreed that Section 5, the pre-clearance provision, which applied to jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, had an effects test and should continue to have an effects test.The debate was about Section 2 and whether it should be an intent test or an effects test. But there was no disagreement among President Reagan, Attorney General Smith. Those of us on Attorney General Smith’s staff, like myself, thought that the protection of the right to vote was critical, that the Voting Rights Act had been extraordinarily effective in preserving that right and should be extended. The debate was solely over whether or not Section 2 should be changed. And Senator Dole, working with other Members of the Senate, crafted a compromise that resolved that dispute. As you said, it put an effects test in Section 2, put in additional language to guard against the sort of proportional representation that was certainly the concern of Attorney General Smith and President Reagan, and that was enacted into law with the President’s support.But there was no disagreement about the critical nature of the right to vote, the notion that it was preservative of all other rights, and the question was simply about how it should be extended, whether extended as is or extended with the change that was enacted under the compromise.

Yes. It was the responsibility of the Justice Department and, before the Supreme Court, of course, the Office of the Solicitor General to enforce the civil rights laws, in particular the Voting Rights Act, as vigorously as possible. And that’s what we did.

Fine, thank you. 

I do, Senator. I think that the Court’s expressions, and I think if my reading of the precedent is correct, I think every Justice on the Court believes that to some extent or another. Liberty is not limited to freedom from physical restraint. It does cover areas, as you said, such as privacy, and it’s not protected only in procedural terms but it is protected substantively as well. Again, I think every member of the Court subscribes to that proposition. If they agree with Bolling v. Sharpe, as I am sure all of them do, they are subscribing to that proposition to some extent or another. 

Certainly. 

Certainly. 

Well, that is in an area where I think I should not respond. 

Because— 

Then-Judge Ginsburg and now Justice Ginsburg explained that she thought she was at greater liberty to discuss her writings. She’d written extensively on that area and I think that’s why she felt at greater liberty to talk about those cases. In other areas, where she had not written, her response was that it was inappropriate to comment. In particular, I remember her response in the Mayer and the Harris cases. She said those are the Court’s precedents; I have no agenda to overrule them, and I will leave it at that. And I think that’s important to adhere to that. Let me explain very briefly why. It’s because if these questions come before me, either on the court on which I now sit or, if I am confirmed, on the Supreme Court, I need to decide those questions with an open mind on the basis of the arguments presented, on the basis of the record presented in the case, and on the basis of the rule of law, including the precedents of the Court, and not on the basis of any commitments during the confirmation process. The litigants have a right to expect that of the judges or Justices before whom they appear. And it’s not just Justice Ginsburg who adhered to that rule. I’ve gone back and read— 

Well, I explained why she felt at liberty to comment— 

Well, that’s how Judge Ginsburg explained it at her nomination hearings. She said she could talk about the issues on which she had written. 

I think it does make sense that she can be questioned about the articles that she’d written because they raised certain questions and she felt at liberty to discuss those. I think it’s something entirely different if you talk about an area that could come before the Court. This is an area that cases are pending before the Court and they will be pending in the future. 

You know, I have no quarrel with the majority’s determination and— 

I understand that. And I’m concerned about ramifications in which the issue could come up. But I have no quarrel with the majority’s determination— 

Well, I think— 

Senator, I think nominees have to draw the line where they’re comfortable. It’s a matter of some— 

It’s a matter of great importance not only to potential Justices but to judges. We’re sensitive to the need to maintain the independence and integrity of the Court. I think it’s vitally important that nominees, to use Justice Ginsburg’s words, no hints, no forecasts, no previews. They go on the Court not as a delegate from this Committee with certain commitments laid out and how they’re going to approach cases. They go on the Court as Justices who will approach cases with an open mind and decide those cases in light of the arguments presented, the record presented, and the rule of law. And the litigants before them have a right to expect that and to have the appearance of that as well.That has been the approach that all of the Justices have taken. 

She said no hints, no forecasts— 

Well, I do know, Senator, that in numerous other cases—because I read the transcript— 

She said, It’s not correct for me to comment. Now, there’s a reason for that, Senator. 

That’s a bad word, Senator. 

Senator, my answer is that the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court requires that nominees before this Committee for a position on that Court not forecast, give predictions, give hints about how they might rule in cases that might come before the Court. 

I’m not going to comment on whether or not a particular nominee adhered to the approach that they announced. 

Senator— 

Senator, I was not speaking specifically to any piece of legislation there. That was making a very—

That was the issue that had come up on the show, and the general issue that was being addressed is a question of federalism. I think it was part of the genius of the Founding Fathers to establish a Federal system with a national government to address issues of national concern; State and local government more close to the people to address issues of State and local concern; obviously, issues of overlap as well. I was not expressing a view on any particular piece of legislation. And I think the statement you read—

The memo you talked about, Senator, I’ve had a chance to look at it. It concerned a 50-State inventory of particular proposals to address it. ‘‘Perceived’’ was not being used in that case to suggest that there was any doubt that there is gender discrimination and that it should be addressed. What it was referring to was a vast inventory, and I was not sure if the particular proposals in each case were supported in every State of the 50State survey that was involved. Of course, gender discrimination is a serious problem. It’s a particular concern of mine and always has been. I grew up with three sisters, all of whom work outside the home. I married a lawyer who works outside the home. I have a young daughter who I hope will have all of the opportunities available to her without regard to any gender discrimination. There is no suggestion in anything that I’ve written of any resistance to the basic idea of full citizenship without regard to gender. 

Yes, Senator, I do. And I, again, always have. The confusion is in the use of the term. There are those who use the term ‘‘heightened scrutiny’’ to refer to what you just called ‘‘strict scrutiny,’’ which is generally limited to issues of race or similar issues. The discrimination on the basis of gender, distinctions on the basis of gender, is subject to what the Supreme Court has called ‘‘intermediate scrutiny.’’ There has to be a substantial Government interest—an important Government interest and a substantial connection in the discrimination. But the Supreme Court’s equal protection analysis has three tiers now—

Referring to what you called strict scrutiny. 

Well, I was about to lay it out, and you said you didn’t want to hear about it. [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Strict scrutiny is the— 

And, Senator, the memorandum is using ‘‘heightened scrutiny’’ the way you used ‘‘strict scrutiny,’’ which is the scrutiny that’s limited to the basis of race. The gender discrimination is, as you know, subject to what is called ‘‘intermediate scrutiny,’’ and that is not what the memo is referring to with respect to heightened scrutiny. It’s referring to the strict scrutiny that’s restricted to issues of race and ethnicity. 

I’m sorry. What was the date of the memo, Senator? 

I can’t elaborate on—I can’t elaborate beyond what’s in the memo. I just— 

Well, I have the memo and see that one of the areas that you mentioned I say that—and this is to the Attorney General, and I say the reason we shouldn’t do this is because ‘‘you have publicly opposed such approaches.’’ So, again, it would have been— 

I was a lawyer on his staff, and according to this memorandum—and, again, I don’t remember anything independently of this 23 years ago. But the memorandum suggests, a staff lawyer to his boss, that this is inconsistent with what you have said. And, again, I guess I would regard that as good staff work rather than anything else. 

Senator, I was a staff lawyer. I didn’t have a position. The administration had a position, and the administration’s position was the two-fold position you’ve set forth. First, Title IX applies. Second, it applies to the office, the admissions office.

The question— 

With respect, they are my answers, and, with respect, they’re not misleading. They’re accurate. This is a— 

So I would say that the administration correctly interpreted the intent of Congress in enacting that legislation. 

Well, and the Supreme Court’s conclusion was that that administration position was a correct reading of the law that this body passed. So if the view was strongly held, it was because I thought that was a correct reading of the law. The Supreme Court concluded that it was a correct reading of the law. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, Senator, judges and Justices do have a side in these disputes. They need to be on the side of the Constitution, and in most of these areas, what the Constitution provides is that these sorts of policy debates, which approach is better suited to promote freedom or to promote progress are vested in the legislative branch. There are areas where the Constitution sets aside certain areas, in the Bill of Rights and other protections of liberty, and says that these areas are beyond the reach of the policymaking branches and judges and Justices have the responsibility to enforce those provisions in the Constitution. But outside of that, judges and Justices should not take sides in these disputes.I think people on both sides need to know that if they go to the Supreme Court that they’re going to be on a level playing field, that the judge is going to interpret the law, that the judge is going to apply the Constitution and not take sides in their dispute. That’s what this body is for in Congress and in the State legislatures, to resolve those types of policy disputes. So long as the resolution is consistent with the Constitution, that’s what the judges are there to ensure, and so long as they ensure that, the Framers’ notion was that freedom and progress would be advanced by allowing those decisions to be made by the people’s elected representatives.

Well, the distinction is a basic one in constitutional law. If you have a facial challenge to a law, as we call it, or a per se challenge might be another way to put it, you’re basically saying the law is unconstitutional without regard to the facts of the case, without regard to the record, whatever the application might be, whoever the parties challenging it might be, there’s something about the law so fundamentally flawed that it’s unconstitutional however it’s going to be applied. That’s a fairly narrow category of cases.The other category is so-called as-applied challenge. You have a law that you know is not facially unconstitutional, but it may be applied in an unconstitutional manner. An easy example, you have a normal statute that’s perfectly constitutional. If it’s applied in a discriminatory manner, it may be unconstitutional as applied in that case. If it can be applied in a constitutional manner, you know, so long as the facts are a certain way, and if the facts turnout in the record not to meet those requirements, then it can be unconstitutional as applied, and in those situations you do need to know what the record is, you do need to know what the facts are, because the challenge might be, this law may be fine for other cases, but when you apply it to this case, when you apply it to this record or these facts, then it’s unconstitutional. So a statute that is constitutional on its face can always be applied in an unconstitutional way, and so you can’t give a categorical determination that there is no way in which that statute could ever be unconstitutionally applied.

Well, that’s right, and particular precedence obviously could be applied to variations on the fact situation that gave rise to that precedent, and sometimes those facts lead to a different results, sometimes those facts don’t. And it makes sense to continue to apply it in a particular manner. But again—and I think most judges are of this view—that the facts are a critical part of the resolution of any dispute.

And of course, that’s a lot of how the law develops, and as lawyers arguing in court, a lot of what I used to spend my time doing was saying, ‘‘This precedent doesn’t apply,’’ and the reason it doesn’t apply is because these facts are different, and so you should reach a different result, or arguing that this precedent does apply even though these facts are different. The reasoning still covers that situation, and then that leads to the next case and so on, and it’s that sort of gradual development of the law that helps shape the rule of law.

Well, I don’t want to comment on any particular case, but I think I can speak more generally about the approach. I know Justices Scalia and Breyer had a little debate about it themselves here in town, and it was very illuminating to get both of their views. And I would say as a general matter that a couple of things that cause concern on my part about the use of foreign law as precedent—as you say, this isn’t about interpreting treaties or foreign contracts, but as precedent on the meaning of American law.The first has to do with democratic theory. Judicial decisions in this country—judges of course are not accountable to the people, but we are appointed through a process that allows for participation of the electorate, the President who nominates judges is obviously accountable to the people. The Senators who confirm judgesare accountable to the people. In that way the role of the judge is consistent with the democratic theory. If we’re relying on a decision from a German judge about what our Constitution means, no President accountable to the people appointed that judge, and no Senate accountable to the people confirmed that judge, and yet he’s playing a role in shaping a law that binds the people in this country. I think that’s a concern that has to be addressed.The other part of it that would concern me is that relying on foreign precedent doesn’t confine judges. It doesn’t limit their discretion the way relying on domestic precedent does. Domestic precedent can confine and shape the discretion of the judges.In foreign law you can find anything you want. If you don’t find it in the decisions of France or Italy, it’s in the decisions of Somalia or Japan or Indonesia or wherever. As somebody said in another context, looking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends. You can find them, they’re there. And that actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows the judge to incorporate his or her own personal preferences, cloak them with the authority of precedent because they’re finding precedent in foreign law, and use that to determine the meaning of the Constitution. I think that’s a misuse of precedent, not a correct use of precedent.

I don’t want to overly expand my role. It was consistent with what I’ve done in other cases. There was a particular appellate issue that arose. The firm had been representing the inmate for some time. One of the senior leading partners at the firm, Barrett Prettyman, had been heavily involved in his case for many years. A particular appellate issue came up and I was asked to get involved, and I was happy to do that, and assist in that way. Again, it was kind of consistent with the general approach. It was in an area in which I was—had some experience and was happy to pitch in and help in that area.

No. That’s the way it happened. I was scheduled to argue in the D.C. Circuit, and what happened is the Friday before the Monday argument, the clerk of the court called. We had a new lawyer who was not yet a member of the Supreme Court bar in the office, and I think we considered it kind of a pro forma matter, we were moving his admission pro hac vice so he could argue that day. And I think this was the Supreme Court’s way of telling us that they didn’t consider it a pro forma matter. So we got notified the Friday night before the Monday argument that they were not going to grant the pro hac motion, which is of course to let himargue the case even though he wasn’t a member of the bar, and it fell to me to pick up that case to be prepared to argue it Monday morning. Then in the afternoon I went and did the argument in the D.C. Circuit, which had been previously scheduled.

Well, the Court got it right in each case. [Laughter.] 

Well, I think different things, you pick up different things. With Judge Friendly, it was he had such a total commitment to excellence in his craft at every stage of the process, just a total devotion to the rule of law and the confidence that if you just worked hard enough at it, you’d come up with the right answers. And it was his devotion to the rule of law that he took the most pleasure in. He liked the fact that the editorialists of the day couldn’t decide whether he was a liberal or a conservative, and he would be chastised for the same opinion, depending on which paper had read it, as either that conservative judge or that liberal judge, and because he wasn’t adhering to a political ideology, he was adhering to the rule of law. And his devotion to it went to the extent—and I know other of his clerks had the same experience. I do remember one time where he was assigned the opinion, and he kept writing it and writing it, and he finally decided it was not right. And so he wrote a dissent. And he circulated the best majority he could come up with and said, ‘‘I don’t agree with it, here’s my dissent.’’ And of course, as you might imagine, the other two judges were persuaded by his dissent, and it came out that way, a sort of open-mindedness at every stage, the appreciation that it may not be the argument, it may not be the briefs, it may be down to the actual writing that reveals what he thinks the right answer is. And also he did have an essential humility about him. He was an absolute genius. I mean there’s no doubt about it, and certainly whatever he was reviewing, the decision of an agency, the decision of its legislature, the notion of saying, you know, we defer to them because it’s their responsibility, I think everybody would have agreed we would have a better result if we just let him make the decision, regardless of what it was. But he had the essential humility to appreciate that he was a judge, and that this decision should be made by this agency or this decision by that legislature. And when you read his opinions, he doesn’t just sort of, you know, knock the pieces off the board. He marches through in a very careful way to let you know exactly how he reached the decision, why he went this way if there was a difference among the precedents, why he chose that one if there was a question of who has the responsibility, why he went that way, and lays it all out in such a way that you can understand the result.To this day, lawyers will say, when they get into an area of the law and they pick up one of his opinions, that you can look at it and it’s like having a guide to the whole area of the law.With the then-Justice Rehnquist, who I clerked for the next year, I do remember doing a draft for him once, and coming in and he had thought that it was sort of the first topic sentence of each paragraph was good, and the rest of it could be junked. You know, I pushed back a little bit as I hoped was appropriate, and he said at that point, he said, ‘‘Well, I’ll tell you what. Why don’t we put all this other stuff down in footnotes? We’ll just keep sort of the first sentence of each paragraph, put the rest down in footnotes.’’ And I figured, well, that was a fair compromise.So I would go back and rework it, and hand it to him with some pride, and he looks at it and he says, ‘‘Well, all right. Now take out the footnotes.’’[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. So one thing I learned from him was, I hope, to try to write crisply and efficiently, that a lot of extra stuff could be dispensed with, and just—so many people mentioned it during his eulogies and at the sort of gathering of the clerks, his general approach to the balance between work and family life. I think that was a very important lesson to learn at an early age. 

Well, Senator, I think the answer to your question is yes. The research into the original understanding of the drafters of the 14th Amendment has expanded and changed quite a bit, and I think a very good case can be made about their views. But, more importantly, the issue was the institution of public education wasn’t as established at the time as it was in 1954, the time of the crafting of the amendment. And, you know, the Framers spoke in broad language, and whether they specifically addressed the question of public education or not isn’t the limitation. Their intent was not limited to the particular problem. They chose broad language, and they should be held to their word. And I think it is perfectly consistent with an original understanding to argue and to conclude that their original understanding meant that segregated schools were unconstitutional, not just in 1954 but at the time they enacted the amendment. I think a strong case can be made there.And what was interesting about the Brown case—maybe it’s my own perspective, but if you look at the arguments in that case, yes, John W. Davis arguing for the Board was arguing on the basis of precedent in Plessy v. Ferguson, saying this is the established law. But so was Thurgood Marshall. He went in and he was arguing on the basis of more recent precedent, Sweatt v. Painter, a more recent decision of the Court about law school separate but equal. And he was saying you need to build on that more recent precedent in addressing this case.So the Court was not changing the strike zone. That wasn’t the way Marshall presented his argument. And it wasn’t necessary for them to say we’re changing the rules of the game. What was necessary for them to do and what Marshall was urging them to do was to get it right when they had gotten it wrong in Plessy.

Well, of course, it was a dramatic shift, and the overruling of Plessy v. Ferguson was exactly that. My point is simply that if you look at the Brown decision, it is more consistent with the 14th Amendment and the original understanding of the 14th Amendment than Plessy v. Ferguson, and it’s based on the conclusion that the separation of the races in the schools was itself a violation of equal protection. In other words, it’s not a departure from the 14th Amendment. It was a departure from the—

Certainly. 

Not automatons, no, Senator. I appreciate that, that judges don’t. And, of course, we all bring our life experiences to the bench. But I will say this: that the ideal in the American justice system is epitomized by the fact that judges, Justices, do wear the black robes, and that is meant to symbolize the fact that they’re not individuals promoting their own particular views, but they are supposed to be doing their best to interpret the law, to interpret the Constitution, according to the rule of law, not their own preferences, not their own personal beliefs. That’s the ideal.

Absolutely. 

The last part of your question, Senator, is, of course, really what’s carved on the entrance to the Supreme Court: ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ That is the commitment physically embodied in the Supreme Court, and it’s the commitment in the Constitution. And I think the most important thing the Supreme Court can do and the judicial branch can do is to uphold the rule of law. That is the—I tried to point this out in my statement yesterday. That is the key to making all the rights that are in the Constitution, all the rights that legislators may confer on citizens, that’s the key to making them meaningful. The difference between our system and our Constitution and the Soviet constitution that President Reagan used to talk about—it has wonderful rights in it, too. It didn’t mean a thing because there was not an independent Supreme Court, an independent judiciary to enforce those rights. We do have that, and that’s the reason that we have been able to make progress in the area of rights and not had just empty paper promises. So to the extent you’re talking about the injustices in society and the discrimination in society, the best thing the courts can do is enforce the rule of law and provide a level playing field for people to come in and vindicate their rights and enforce the rule of law. 

Well, the courts are, of course, passive institutions. We hear cases that are brought before us. We don’t go out and bring cases. We don’t have the constitutional authority to execute the law. We don’t have the constitutional authority to make the law. Our obligation is decide the cases that are presented.Now, I’m confident, just in the nature of things, that there will be cases presented arising out of that horrible disaster of all sorts, and many of those will be Federal cases, I’m sure. Others will be in the State courts, and, again, the obligation of the Federal judiciary and the State judiciary is to make sure they provide a place where people can have their claims, their litigation decided fairly and efficiently according to the rule of law. That’s the appropriate role for the judicial branch.

I certainly agree that reasonable people can disagree about that decision, yes.

Yes. 

I think so, Senator. The position that you’re reading from there was the position of the administration. I was one of nine lawyers on the brief in that case. It was reflecting the position that had been advanced in four prior cases up to that point by the administration, and we were reiterating that position. This was before the Supreme Court issued its decision in Casey. That was the view of the administration and the conclusion. I don’t think there’s anything in there that suggests we think or thought that anybody at that time who disagreed was unreasonable. That was our legal position. The other side was obviously presented in those cases. 

And in those cases, the other side argued that there was. And I don’t think there’s anything in either of those views that suggests you don’t think that reasonable people can take different positions on those questions. 

My view in preparing all the memoranda that people have been talking about was as a staff lawyer. I was promoting the views of the people for whom I worked. In some instances, those were consistent with personal views; in other instances, they may not be. In most instances, no one cared terribly much what my personal views were. They were to advance the views of the administration for which I worked.

Well, at this point, of course, we are now 23, 24 years later. I would not—I would have to address each of those positions anew. I wouldn’t try to transport myself back 24 years and say, What did you think 24 years ago? And that would require me to look at and examine all those things. And, of course, it’s not how I would look at the issue if I were a judge. If I were a staff lawyer advancing a particular view, it’s one thing. As a judge, I would want to confront the issue with an open mind, to fully and fairly consider the briefs and arguments of all parties, to consider the record—we’ve talked today about how important a record is in a particular case—consider the law and the precedents. And, of course, the law and the precedents have changed in many of these areas dramatically over the past 24 years.I’d have to consider all those before reaching a conclusion in any of those particular areas.

I agree with the Griswold Court’s conclusion that marital privacy extends to contraception and availability of that. The Court since Griswold has grounded the privacy right discussed in that case in the liberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause—that’s the approach that the Court has taken in subsequent cases—rather than in the penumbras and emanations that were discussed in Justice Douglas’ opinion. And that view of the result is, I think, consistent with the subsequent development of the law, which is focused on the Due Process Clause and liberty rather than Justice Douglas’ approach.

Well, I feel comfortable commenting on Griswold and the result in Griswold because that does not appear to me to be an area that is going to come before the Court again. It was surprising when it came before the Court in 1965, I think, to many people. The other area is an area that is, to quote Justice Ginsburg from her hearings, ‘‘live with business.’’ There are cases that arise there, and so that’s an area that I do not feel it appropriate for me to comment on.

I certainly think Presidents have and will consider a broad range of issues and characteristics and qualifications in selecting their nominees, and that’s certainly one for a President to consider. 

For the upcoming vacancy? 

I just wanted to make clear we weren’t talking about this one. I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to comment in any way about the President’s future selections, other than to say that I’m happy with his past ones. [Laughter.] 

You know, that would be one of those memos that I no longer agree with, Senator.[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I didn’t fully appreciate what was involved in the confirmation process when I wrote that. You know, the sentiments that were expressed there I think are certainly something that’s worth discussing, perhaps. My basic point was when the Framers establish a system of life tenure, people didn’t live as long as they do now. You know, I do think there are concerns, though, that I may be a little more, a bit more sensitive to now than I was then, and they have to do with sort of a definite cut-off point. I’m not sure that’s healthy for the institution of the judiciary, for people to know, for example, well, it’s sort of like—as you say, term limits—that if we wait another year, this judge will be gone or that Justice will be gone. I’m not sure today from where I sit that that is a good or healthy thing for the judiciary. 

I have to say I do not because I do think that that restriction at the end, so litigants could look and shape their litigation in light of who they think the judges or Justices might be, I think that’s not a healthy development. I would note that, if I’m remembering the memo correctly, I think it was a proposed constitutional amendment, which I am not sure, but I think that obviously is a policy choice that the Constitution allows to be pursued through that process. 

You know, I do think that the availability of legal services is not as broad and widespread as it should be. There are so many things and areas where I think lawyers could make a valuable contribution, but it’s too expensive. And there are a number of responses that I think the bar should be taking. Obviously, for those at the lowest end of the income scale, I think there’s an obligation to provide pro bono legal services. I think the big firms, little firms, medium firms—everybody needs to get involved in that. There’s not enough appreciation about how you can do that. For example, everybody thinks in terms of bringing a big case, litigation. You know, lawyers who do estate work can provide extremely valuable pro bono services. Lawyers who do tax work canprovide extremely valuable pro bono services, the whole range of services, corporate work. I know lawyers in my old firm would do a lot of pro bono services helping set up nonprofit organizations, ensuring that they’re complying with the law. People need to be a little more creative in the ways in which they can help.I regard that as an obligation of the bar and I do think—in fact, in many cases, the situation you get is the people at the lowest end have access to pro bono services. People at the highest end can pay. It’s the people in the middle who are left without legal services that could be extremely valuable, and I do think the bar needs to do more. I think firms need to do more. Individual lawyers need to do more.

Well, I know the memos to which you’re referring make the point, answer your second question. I said that they were a bad idea. They were bad policy.I’d been asked earlier when I was—back in 1981, I believe, when I was working in the Attorney General’s office, to present to him an affirmative case for the proposition that these proposals were constitutional. He was getting an opinion that they were unconstitutional. He had to make that decision for the Department’s position. He wanted me to argue the other side and I did. I prepared a memorandum presenting the best argument I could that these proposals were constitutional.The two memos to which you refer in the White House where I suggested I thought they were suggest that my memo persuaded me, if nobody else. The Attorney General adopted instead the contrary position. And I think my views may have had something to do with the proximity to my own advocacy at the time.As I say, I did say they were a bad policy. The reason I thought they were a bad policy is because they lead to a situation where there’s arguable inconsistency and disuniformity in Federal law. If you don’t have the Supreme Court with jurisdiction to address that, then you get different decisions, and that’s bad policy.If I were to look at the question today, to be honest with you, I don’t know where I would come out. I think one of the questions I would have is whether these concerns I had that I labeled as policy concerns might more appropriately be considered legal arguments, in other words, not a policy dispute but a legal argument.That’s the way the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that the Attorney General agreed with viewed it. They said these—the fact of disuniformity and inconsistency is a legal argument against theconstitutionality. It’s not simply a bad policy decision. I’m not sure where I would regard that determination today.

Well, I don’t think—on the question of legislative attempts, I think my view is the same now as it was 24 years ago, which is that these are—it’s a bad idea. It’s bad policy.I was talking about the other question about whether it’s constitutional or not, and on that, of course, I don’t think I should express a determinative view because, as you know, these proposals do come up and one may be enacted, and if that is the case, then I’d have to address that question on the court. It could be on the court I’m on now or another court.

Well, I don’t know what my mind would tell me—

Yes, but I feel comfortable with the conclusion, as I was 24 years ago, that it’s a bad idea. They’re bad policy. 

Well, we’ve talked about the term limits for judges. More generally, as I look at all of these documents, and the numbers, somebody said 80,000 pages. It’s a little daunting. I don’t know that there are particular issues. I mean, you have to remember, this is 23, 22, 24 years ago. In many of these cases, not only have I changed, the law has changed dramatically in more than two decades. You know, I’m sure—and again, of the many that have been released, I will say that it’s really only a handful that have attracted attention for one reason or another, and I do think if you look at the whole body of work, that I would hope people would leave that with a favorable impression.Certainly, there are many areas where it appears that I knew a lot more when I was 25 than I think I know now when I’m 50. I had a lot of different experiences in the intervening period that give you valuable perspective. In that intervening period, for example, I left the government, went out in the private sector, litigated a lot of cases against the government. You do get a different view of things when you’re on the other side. I think that’s extremely valuable.I hope, as you suggest, I’ve grown as a person over that period, as well, and that that also gives you some perspective and that type of a perspective might cause somebody to moderate their tone with respect to some issues and in some areas, and I’m sure that’s the case. I certainly wouldn’t write everything today as I wrote it back then, but I don’t think any of us would do things or write things today as we did when we were 25 and had all the answers.

Good afternoon. 

I appreciate that, Senator. If I am confirmed, that is something that I will address and take very seriously. I think, as in many areas, my first priority is going to be to listen, to learn a little bit more about what’s involved.I’ll be very candid. When I first learned about the FISA Court, I was surprised. It’s not what we usually think of when we think of a court. We think of a place where we can go, we can watch the lawyers argue and it’s subject to the glare of publicity and the judges explain their decision to the public and they can examine them. That’s what we think of as a court.This is a very different and unusual institution. That was my first reaction. I appreciate the reasons that it operates the way it does, but it does seem to me that the departures from the normal judicial model that are involved there put a premium on the individuals involved.I think the people who are selected for that tribunal have to be above reproach. There can’t be any question that these are among the best judges that our system has, the fairest judges, the ones who are most sensitive to the different issues involved because they don’t have the oversight of the public being able to see what’s going on.Again, to be perfectly honest, it is a very unusual situation and I do think it places a great premium on making sure that the bestqualified people for that position are selected.

Well, again, of course, without commenting on any of the particular hypotheticals or actual cases—

I do think, though, first as a general matter and then to get into the law, that it is important that people keep a basic principle in mind when they’re addressing these types of concerns. It’s not a provision in the Constitution, it’s not a provision in the law, but it’s a basic American approach that I think is important, and that’s captured in the expression, you know, it’s a freecountry. And when you’re talking about what people can say, what people can—signs they can put up, what they can do, I think people, as a general matter, need to appreciate that it’s a free country and it’s a wonderful thing that people can say things in the public that you may not agree with because you, of course, have the same right.Now, the particular mode of analysis that the Supreme Court uses in addressing these types of public speech issues is to some extent unsettled. The public forum doctrine, as it’s called, for many years you’ve tried to characterize an issue. Is this a public forum? Is it a quasi-public forum? Is it a private forum? And the different definition sort of carried with it the conclusion about what could be allowed, and many of the Justices thought that the reasoning was awfully circular.I remember years ago I argued one of the cases in the Supreme Court about post office and what could be done in a post office area and whether the restriction of that area to postal business meant they could exclude people who wanted to engage in political speech. I remember thinking at the time that the precedents were very unsettled and I’m not sure that the Court has made much progress since then.But you do try to focus a little bit on whether you’re dealing with a public forum, one that has traditionally been open to expression, and if it has, then any restrictions on expression are going to be subject to a very exacting standard before they’ll be upheld. If it’s a more limited public forum, it’s only been open for certain types of speech or the nature of the forum requires there to be a restriction—that was the government’s argument in the post office case I litigated—then it’s a less-demanding standard in those situations.

Well, I do know— 

I appreciate the point, and I do know that even the analysis in this particular area, one of the factors that the Court considers is the availability of alternative avenues for expression, and a concern, if they are cutting off a particular mode of expression, a particular avenue, are there alternatives available? And I think that’s a very important consideration. I think you’re quite right that this is one of those areas in which technology is going to figure in a very prominent way, and the question of whether this type of analysis that grew up when you’re talking about a public square or a town hall type thing, applies in the Internet situation, and whether there’s changes that do need to be made in the analysis. 

Well, Senator, it’s my understanding under the Supreme Court’s doctrine that pornographic expression is not protected to the same extent at least as political and core speech, and the difficulty that the Court has addressed in these different areas of course is always defining what is or is not pornography and what is entitled to protection under the First Amendment and what is not.That question is sort of antecedent to the question of what the level of protection is. We determine whether it’s entitled to First Amendment protection in the first place. In certain types of speech, like child pornography, the Court has determined are not entitled to protection under the First Amendment. There are different categories, and the Court has struggled over the years in figuring out how to determine those categories and what belongs in what category, and beyond that, I don’t think I can give a more precise answer.

Again, and of course, without getting into the particulars, the reason that congressional fact finding and determination is important in these cases is because the courts recognize that they can’t do that. Courts can’t have, as you said, whatever it was, the 13 separate hearings before passing particular legislation. Courts—the Supreme Court can’t sit and hear witness after witness after witness in a particular area and develop that kind of a record. Courts can’t make the policy judgments about what type of legislation is necessary in light of the findings that are made. So the findings play an important role, and I think it is correct to say under the law in this area and others, they’re neither necessary nor necessarily sufficient. But I know as a judge that they’re extremely helpful when there are findings.And judges know when they look at those, that they’re the result of an exhaustive process of a sort that the Court cannot duplicate. We simply don’t have the institutional expertise or the resources or the authority to engage in that type of a process. So that is sort of the basis for the deference to the fact finding that is made. It’s institutional competence. The courts don’t have it. Congress does. It’s constitutional authority. It’s not our job. It is your job. So the defence to congressional findings in this area has a solid basis.Now, the particular area you’re talking about under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, the Garrett case, there are of course more recent cases that you know of, Tennessee v. Lane and the Hibbs casein Nevada v. Hibbs, where the Court did defer to the fact finding in those cases, and particularly in the Hibbs case focused on the legislative recognition based on its examination of the factual record developed at hearings about the statute that was at issue there, and the particular approach that they were taking to remedy discrimination under the 14th Amendment, which is the authority that Congress has.Now, the legal requirement that the Court has articulated there came of course from the City of Boerne case, that the remedial approach has to be congruent and proportional. Justice Scalia signed on to that approach in the City of Boerne case. In the Lane case he said he had changed his mind and he no longer agreed with that. Any area of the law where Justice Scalia is changing his mind, has got to be one that is particularly difficult, and one that I think is appropriately regarded as still evolving and emerging. And so I don’t know if the more recent cases in Lane and Hibbs represent a swinging of the pendulum away from cases like Garrett and Kimmel on the other side, or if it’s simply part of the process of the Court trying to come to rest with an approach in this area.But it is an area that the Court has found difficult, and just as a general matter, I think when you get to this point of reweighing congressional findings, that starts to look more like a legislative function, and the courts need to be very careful as they get into that area, to make sure that they’re interpreting the law and not making it.

Certainly. 

It was a divided decision. 

The argument was whether Congress had the authority under the Spending Clause as a condition of the receipt of Federal funds that WMATA—the Metro here in D.C.—receives, that they waive their sovereign immunity to suit under the disability provisions, and the argument was that Congress lacked that authority, that they could not impose a waiver of sovereign immunity as a condition for the receipt of Federal funds to allow an individual alleging discrimination on the basis of disability to sue. There was no issue about whether there was sovereign immunity in the absence of a waiver, and the WMATA governing body was opposing the suit on the ground that it had not waived immunity. And they were arguing that Congress lacked the authority to condition the receipt of funds on a waiver of immunity. It was a divided decision, a 2–1 vote. The dissenter argued that this was an inappropriate exercise of the Spending Clause power. The majority concluded that, no, this was within Congress’s authority. It could condition the receipt of Federal funds on a waiver of sovereign immunity that allowed an individual alleging he was discriminated against in employment because of his disability to proceed with the suit. The arguments we rejected were arguments of germaneness. The idea was the funds were for transportation, not for employment, and so that it wasn’t a germane condition. The majority rejected those arguments. The dissent would have ruled the other way. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I have always supported and support today equal rights for women, particularly in the workplace. I was very pleased when I saw, for example, the report of the National Association of Women Lawyers who went out and talked and interviewed with women lawyers who’ve worked with me, who’ve appeared before me, and the conclusion was that I not only always treated women lawyers with respect and equal dignity, but that I had made special accommodations for life-work issues to ensure that women could continue to progress, for example, at my law firm, and had already treated women who appeared before me in a perfectly professional way.

Well, let’s take the first one you mentioned. It is to me obvious in the memo that I wrote to Fred Fielding that it was about whether or not it’s good to have more lawyers. Whether they were from homemakers, from plumbers, from artists or truck drivers had nothing to do with it. The point was: Is it good to have more lawyers? That’s the way I intended it, and I’m sure that’s the way— 

I think there were probably—the point that Mr. Fielding and I had commented on, on many occasions, was that inmany areas there were too many lawyers, and that’s a common joke that goes back to Shakespeare. It has nothing to do with homemakers. The notion that that was my view is totally inconsistent and rebutted by my life. I married a lawyer. I was raised with three sisters who worked outside the home. I have a daughter for whom I will insist at every turn that she has equal citizenship rights with her brother.

Well, those comments were in the nature of the tone that was encouraged in our office. It was a small office. They expected we turn projects around very quickly. We were expected to be candid, and if making a joke about lawyers would make for a more enjoyable day on the part of the people in the office, that’s what we did.

Well, I don’t think in any way that is based on anything other than full equal citizenship rights on the basis of gender. I might tell a lawyer’s joke that there are too many lawyers today, but that’s all it was back then.On the memo you quoted with respect to the issue of comparable worth, the one thing the memorandum made clear is that the position of the administration was there must be equal pay for equal work. That wasn’t the issue in that case. The issue there was whether there should be equal pay for different work and whether judges should determine what type of work was equal.

My understanding there was that there was a question whether intervention in that case—the case was being pursued by private litigants already—a question whether intervention by the Federal Government in that case was consistent with the Attorney General’s approach to institutional litigation. That was an approach that he had laid out in several speeches, memoranda, and, as a staff member, it was my job to call to his attention areas where I thought there may be inconsistencies in areas where he wanted to set policy priorities.

Well, Senator, first of all, I don’t necessarily regard it as an implied right. It is the part of the liberty that is protected under the Due Process Clause. That liberty is enumerated—

Yes, and the exact scope of it with respect to the beginning of life and the end of life, those are issues that are coming before the Court in both respects. And I don’t think I should go further to elaborate upon whether or not it applies in those particular situations. Obviously, it has been articulated by the Court in both contexts, the Cruzan case with respect to the end of life, the Glucksberg case following Cruzan. But I don’t think it’s appropriate for me, given the fact that cases arise on both of those questions, to go further. 

Well, that is—that determination in Casey becomes one of the precedents of the Court entitled to respect, like any other precedent of the Court, under principles of stare decisis. I have tried to draw the line about not agreeing or disagreeing with particular rulings, but that is a precedent of the Court. It is a precedent on precedent; in other words, it has examined Roe— 

Well, it said that, and that is a precedent entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis, like any other precedent of the Court. But in terms of a separate determination on my part whether this decision is correct or that decision is correct, my review of what other nominees have done is that that is where they draw the line and that is where I have drawn the line. 

Certainly, or as it is often expressed in the Court’s opinions, settled expectations. People expect that the law is going to be what the Court has told them the law is going to be. And that’s an important consideration.

That’s what the Court—I think you’re reading from the plurality, the joint opinion in the case.

Yes. 

Well, again, I think that’s asking me whether I think the decision was correct or not on that point. It certainly was the analysis of the joint opinion in the Court, entitled to respect as precedent like any other decision of the Court under principles of stare decisis. And that would certainly be where I would begin if any of these issues come before the Court if I were to be confirmed. I would begin with the precedent that the Court has laid out in this area. 

That is what Casey held, yes, and that, as I said before, the precedent of the Court, like any other precedent of the Court, is entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. 

Well, I think Justice—then Judge Ginsburg felt at greater liberty to discuss that precisely for the reason you noted, that she’d given a lecture on the subject. Those are issues that come up again and again before the Court. Consistent with what I understand the approach to have been of other nominees, I don’t think I should express a view on that. 

Well, Senator, it was a position and an argument that the administration made that was accepted by the Supreme Court by a vote of six to three. The point, underlying point was that under the statute at issue in Bray, the Ku Klux Klan Act required under the Supreme Court’s precedents that people engaged in the challenged activity must be motivated by a discriminatory animus. Obviously, under the Ku Klux Klan Act, the classic case, racial hostility.And the issue was, are people opposed, in the Bray case, opposed to abortion opposed to women, and the determination of the Court was that, no, that there are people who are opposed to abortion and that does not constitute opposition or discriminatory animus against women and, therefore, that the Ku Klux Klan Act didn’t apply. Many other provisions obviously apply in the case of abortion protestor violence, including State law and other provisions of Federal law. But the Supreme Court concluded six to three that there is no discriminatory animus based on opposition to abortion.

Well, of course, I tried to avoid saying whether I agree or disagree with particular cases. But I would point out in this area, in particular, I think it’s very important to look at the most recent case, which is the Raich case, the medical marijuana case, because the argument there was that these two decisions that you’re talking about that were the first in the 60 years, Lopez and Morrison, the argument there was based on Lopez and Morrison, Congress lacks the power in this area.And what the Supreme Court said in the Raich case, which I think is very important, it said there are a lot more precedents on the Commerce Clause besides Lopez and Morrison, and the appropriate way to regard those is two decisions in the more than 200year sweep of decisions in which the Supreme Court has given extremely broad—it’s recognized extremely broad authority on Congress’s part, going all the way back to Gibbons v. Ogden and Chief Justice John Marshall, when those Commerce Clause decisions were important in binding the Nation together as a single commercial unit.So again, without commenting on whether particular decisions are correct or not, I do think it’s important to recognize that the Court itself in its most recent decision has said we need to focus on the broad sweep and not just on those two decisions.

Well, the opinion I wrote there noted that the panel decision that I thought should be reheard en banc looked at one ground for under the Commerce Clause and the concluding paragraph in my opinion said that we ought to rehear the case to look at other grounds that were also under the Commerce Clause, but they were not the particular prong of the Commerce Clause analysis that the panel opinion had relied on, and the reason was that, as I explained in the opinion, another circuit court has suggested pointedly that the approach in the panel opinion was inconsistent with the Supreme Court.And I thought if there was another basis for sustaining the Endangered Species Act that was not inconsistent in the view of another circuit court, that we ought to look at that and try to do it. It really reflects a restrained and minimalist approach. If there’s a ground that doesn’t cause another circuit court to say, you’re violating the Supreme Court precedents, we ought to look at that and see if we could rest the decision there.

Right, but the one point I would emphasize is my opinion did not conclude that there was no authority under the Commerce Clause in just that situation. There was another dissenting opinion that was filed by another judge who said this violates the Commerce Clause. I did not join that opinion. I wrote separately to say that we should hear this en banc with all the judges because there are other ways of sustaining this Act that don’t implicate the concern that has caused the other circuit to question our approach that had caused the dissenting judge to conclude there was no authority, and I thought we ought to look at those other grounds because if we could sustain it without implicating that objection, that would be better all around.I did not take the position that it was outside the scope of the Commerce Clause. It was a question of which ground under the Commerce Clause we ought to look at.

I have not had occasion to decide that. I did not decide it in the Rancho Viejo case. One of the other judges did andI did not join that opinion. What I said is we should consider these other grounds. Now, I didn’t have the opportunity, because there was a dissent from rehearing, to consider those other grounds.Those other grounds were what other courts, the Fifth Circuit in the GDF case, had used to sustain application of the Endangered Species Act in the cases that came before them. They didn’t get into the question of whether you look at the regulated activity, the building or the actual what was prohibited, the taking of the toad. They analyzed the protection of the endangered species as implicating a commercial activity, and that allowed them to sustain the Act without regard to whether it had an interstate effect itself.

Senator, I think the reason we have the two clauses in the Constitution in the First Amendment reflects the Framers’ experience. Many of them or their immediate ancestors were fleeing religious persecution. They were fleeing established churches. And it makes perfect sense to put those two provisions together, no establishment of religion and guaranteeing free exercise. That reflected the Framers’ experience. 

Well, I don’t know what you mean by absolute separation of church and state. For example, recently in the Ten Commandments case, the Court upheld a monument on the Texas capitol grounds that had the Ten Commandments in it. They struck down the posting of the Ten Commandments in a Kentucky courthouse. Is it correct to call the monument on the Texas capitol grounds with the Ten Commandments, is that an absolute separation, or is that an accommodation of a particular monument, along with others, that five of the Justices found was consistent with the First Amendment? So I don’t know what that means when you say absolute separation. I do know this, that my faith and my religious beliefs do not play a role in judging. When it comes to judging, I look to the law books and always have. I don’t look to the Bible or any other religious source. 

I agree with his expression that it’s a basic right to be left alone and I think that animating principle is a very important one. With regard to particular restrictions he was talking about, wiretapping, or I forget how the interception actually at issue there, I don’t think it’s appropriate to comment on. But as a general statement of the principle, and again, it reflects just the basic understanding that it’s a free country and the right to be left alone is one of our basic rights. I do agree with that. 

Well, that’s an issue that is before the Court in particular cases and I can’t comment on a case that’s coming before the Court. If I am confirmed, I would have to confront that case with an open mind in light of the arguments presented, in light of the precedents of the Court, and the litigants in those cases are entitled to have judges that haven’t expressed views on that particular case. 

Well, I went on to explain that the right—any time there’s an assertion of a right, there’s quite often an assertion of a contrary right. I think it was similar to a point Senator Kyl was making earlier, that, for example, if you’re asserting a right against government regulation, then the right of the people to regulate through their elected representatives that’s being struck down, that right is being restricted. So it’s usually not—it’s often not, we could view that as a right on one side and there’s nothing on the other side. But there’s often an assertion of a right on the other side. And what the courts have to do is make sure they provide a level playing field in which people disputing the impact of the Constitution, on whose right prevails, have judges who will decide that case according to the rule of law, and not according to whether they think one right should prevail or another. 

Well, Senator, that is exactly one of the questions that’s before the Court, and I can’t answer that in the abstract. I have to answer that on the basis of the parties’ arguments, on the basis of the record in the case, on the basis of the precedents. An abstract opinion that would prejudge that case would be inappropriate for a nominee to express.

I think courts have a limited role in general, and that is that they only interpret the law, they don’t make the law, they don’t shape the policy. Now, the application of that basic principle, which is very important to me, in a particular case is obviously something that hospitable to wait for the litigation of that case, the arguments in that case, the arguments of the lawyers about whether it’s consistent with the precedents or inconsistent with the precedents, but the basic principle, the courts should not be shaping public policy—that’s for the legislators—is a fundamental principle with which I agree.

Thank you, Senator. 

Yes, that was the court of appeals position. 

Yes. 

Well— 

No. I don’t— 

It was a renewal of a debate that was had between the administration and Senator Kennedy 20 plus years ago, and certainly the issue of whether the Supreme Court had interpreted Section 2 and what it had said and whether or not it was correct, was mooted. Senator Kennedy’s position eventually prevailed as a matter of legislation. Through the good offices of Senator Dole and others, the compromise was worked out, and the totality of the circumstances test enacted under Section 2. 

That was my understanding of, and certainly the administration’s understanding of Mobile and its interpretation of Section 2. And as I said, the debate was largely mooted by the legislative change that was enacted. 

That’s right, and it is in many areas—well, certainly every area involving interpretation of the statute—the final say is not with the Supreme Court. The final say on a statute is with Congress, and if they don’t like the Supreme Court’s interpretation of it, they can change it, and that’s what happened in this case. 

Absolutely. 

That’s right. Yeah, there is no question of equal pay for equal work. It’s the idea that someone should decide that different jobs are of comparable worth and that therefore they should be paid the same. And the district court adopted that approach, was reversed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in an opinion by then-Judge Anthony Kennedy. 

That’s what most people, most of us think of when we think of going to court. You’re there. You know, you bring in the witnesses. They testify, they’re cross-examined by the other side. There’s one judge supervising the trial. If it’s a jury case the jury is there. That’s where most of the fact finding takes place. People have different versions of events, you know, who was there, what did they do? And people tell different stories, and that is where you try to sort that out, either before the jury or the single judge.

That’s right. The big difference, when you get up to the court of appeals, is that the facts are not really in play any more. Somebody’s been determined—they think you’re guilty or they buy your version of events. The court of appeals usually just looks at the legal issues. Somebody says, ‘‘The judge made a mistake. He shouldn’t have let that witness testify, or he should have recognized that the police had no authority to conduct that search’’ in a criminal case. And that’s appealed to the court of appeals, where in the Federal system there are three judges, and they’re just looking at that legal question. And they just go back and look at the law, the precedents, and determine whether or not the law was correctly applied in the trial court of if mistake had been made and they need to do it over again.

As a court of appeals judge, that’s exactly the kind of brief you’re looking for, and every now and then you get one.[Laughter.] 

Not just sometimes, Senator, quite often that’s my reaction. That’s part of the adversary system, and you need to have lawyers doing a good job presenting the best arguments on either side so you can feel comfortable that you’re making as good a decision as you can. 

That’s what I was always looking for when I was a lawyer, Senator, yes. 

At Supreme Court level that’s very common, and in some cases there are quite literally hundreds of so-called ‘‘friends of the Court’’ or amicus briefs. Different organizations that are interested in a particular ruling and have a particular perspective, a few of them are even helpful. 

If the Supreme Court decides to—this is of course a very big part of their function. They get some 10,000 petitions every year, people saying, ‘‘I want you to hear my case.’’ You know, all lawyers say they’re going to take it all the way to the Supreme Court, 10,000 people try to do that every year. These days the Court hears about 80 of those, 80 of those 10,000. And the selection of which 80 to take is obviously a big part of the Court’s function. But once they have selected those 80 cases, then they go in and have new briefs on the merits, and all these amicus briefs are filed from different organizations presenting their arguments or their particular perspective, and then it’s set for argument. 

They usually get an hour for the whole case, so each side gets a half-hour, and that half-hour is taken up almost entirely by the Justices’ questions. I went back once and counted the questions during my half-hour, and there were over a hundred questions. Obviously some of them are rapid-fire questions, and ifyou follow the Court, you could probably guess who was asking those, and others were more elaborate questions, but more than a hundred in a half-hour.So the job of the lawyer there is to be totally prepared to answer all of those questions. And, of course, some of them are going to lead into traps, and you have to be careful about that. Others are going to be the very difficult questions that the Court is eventually going to base its decision on. But it’s a very both exhilarating and demanding process to go through an oral argument before the Supreme Court.

They do. The Justices, each of whom has prepared the case by not only reading all these briefs and attending the argument, talking it over with their law clerks, but also reading back over the cases, the precedents that the lawyers have been arguing about, they go back and look at those, and then just the Justices in the conference room—no clerks, no staff, just the nine Justices sit in the conference room and talk about it, thrash out the case, eventually get to a point where they take a vote on what they think the disposition should be, the decision should either be affirmed or reversed, or sometimes something else in between, half affirmed, half reversed, sent back, whatever. And then the opinion is assigned, and that’s still very much part of the process, the writing of the opinion, because quite often—or maybe not quite often, but often enough, the Justices find out that as they try to write a particular opinion, different problems come up. It doesn’t seem as— it’s not writing as they thought it would, and sometimes they have to go back and revisit the case because the Justice assigned the opinion decides that it’s not—it should come out the other way or there should be a different reason, a different basis for the decision.And then once the Justice who’s writing it is comfortable with the opinion, they send it around to all the other chambers, and the individual Justices, if they agree with it, they send a memo around to everybody else that says, ‘‘Please join me.’’ That’s just the jargon the Justices use. It means, ‘‘Please join my name to your opinion.’’ And sometimes they will have suggestions. You know, I’d be happy to join your opinion, but I disagree with this section, or I disagree with this footnote, or I disagree with this line of reasoning. If you could change that, I’d be able to join.Well, if you’re a Justice who’s getting—this is the first reaction you’ve gotten, the first vote back, you might be a little more willing to make a change to accommodate that suggestion. If you’ve got seven votes already in the bank and somebody says please change this or change that, maybe you’re a little less willing because maybe then some of the others say, well, now I’m not happy with that change. And it can obviously get to be a very complicated process as the memos fly back and forth and the Court tries to come to some consensus around an opinion.Often, maybe too often, there’s not total agreement, and somebody will write a dissent and send that around. And others will join that.Concurrence, you know, I can’t agree with your reason, but I agree with the result, and so I’m writing separately to give you my reasons.And the balance changes. Somebody can write a concurrence, and all of a sudden they’ve got five votes, and it’s the majority, and the other majority, the original majority becomes the concurrence. But it’s a—the analysis is done at—and this has been my experience on the court of appeals as well—a very high level, and I think it’s critically important that it’s just the Justices alone who go into the conference room, just as on my court now it’s just the judges who go into their conference room, because judges and Justices in that situation can be a lot more open with their views. And it’s been quite common in my experience over the past more than 2 years to have a judge say, ‘‘This is how I view the case,’’ and then another judge say, ‘‘Well, what about this?’’ And the judge can say, ‘‘Well, I hadn’t thought about that’’ or ‘‘The record says this.’’ And you get out the record, put it out there and look at it.

Right. 

I think that’s perfectly accurate, and if you’ve had the experience, as I know every judge and every Justice has, of having your original view changed when you read either the other side’s brief in a case, after reading the opening brief, or had your view changed as a result of the discussion at conference, or had your view changed when you tried to write the opinion one way and it came out the other way, then you appreciate the significance of that process. And it’s a total distortion and a perversion of that process to start out by saying, well, you know, I testified under oath that I thought this decision was correct, so I’m done, you know, no need to read the briefs, no need to listen to the arguments, no need to go into conference and talk with the other judges on the bench, I’ve already given my view under oath. Or even if you are going to be open to reconsideration, to start with that barrier, I testified under oath that this is the correct approach, that this is the right result, now maybe you can persuade me otherwise, well, that’s not the burden that the litigant should have to take. The litigant should be able to know that all of the judges, all of the Justices that that person is arguing before have an open mind and are fully open to the process. 

That’s what I understood my testimony to be, yes, Senator.

No. I feel that it would be very inappropriate for me as a nominee to tell how I would rule on a particular case that might come before the Court.

Absolutely, Senator. I would confront issues in this area as any other area, with an open mind, in light of the arguments, in light of the record, after careful consideration of the views of my colleagues on the bench. And I would confront these questions just as I would any others that come before the Court.

Yes. 

I’m ready to go. 

Absolutely. 

Senator, it’s not something that I have a settled view on and I do think it’s something that I would benefit from the views of my colleagues, and I know that some of them have particular views and some may not. I noticed the last time there was a formal response by the Court to a request to televise a particular argument, the Chief Justice referred the matter to the whole Court and then reported back on it. I’m also aware that there are—I’m not sure if the right word is experimental or trial efforts going on in some of the courts of appeals, the Federal courts of appeals, to televise arguments there, and I know I’ve watched them so I appreciate that opportunity. And I don’t know yet if there’s been an evaluation of how that experiment proceeded, whether the judges thought it went fine, the lawyers, or whatever. I just don’t know.At the Supreme Court level, I do know they experimented recently in a few cases with releasing the audio tapes immediately after the conclusion of the argument. Again, I listened to those on occasion, not every case, but selected cases of particular interest. I know that on our court, my court, I’m sorry, on the court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit, we broadcast at least within the courthouse simultaneously the oral arguments, so I know that the technology is there to do that and I certainly understand the interest and I understand how—I know it was very well received to have the audio tapes immediately available in some of those cases—

Well, I remember the day vividly, Senator. I think I was one of the last people in the country to find out about it. I had entered—gone into a hearing. It was actually in an original action in the Supreme Court. The Special Master was at G.W. Law School and we had a hearing. I think it was starting a little before nine that day. We went in there.I remember just as I was leaving getting a report that a plane had struck the World Trade Center, but it was—at the time, I thought it was, like, you know, one of those tour planes that was— I had no idea what they were reporting. I went into the proceeding and we conducted the hearing. It lasted several hours. Nobody notified us and we didn’t know about it.I remember leaving and trying to walk back to my office—I was at the law firm then—and the street was blocked off and I figured, well, there’s something going on at the White House. I remember walking down further and it was still blocked off and still blocked off. I finally went up to one of these guards and I said, ‘‘What’s going on?’’ and he looked at me like, ‘‘Where have you been?’’ Only then did I begin to appreciate it. I went back to my office, because there was no way to get out of town by then—

Well, it was when I went back to the office and saw the smoke rising from the Pentagon. As you can imagine, that was a chilling sight. The basic issue of how you address the question of civil liberties in wartime, in times of crisis, is a critically important one.The Bill of Rights doesn’t change during times of war. The Bill of Rights doesn’t change in times of crisis. There may be situations where demands are different and they have to be analyzed appropriately so that things that might have been acceptable in times of war are not acceptable in times of peace. I think everyone appreciates that. But the Bill of Rights is not suspended and the obligation of the courts to uphold the rule of law is not suspended.

I think—I don’t recall recognizing that in particular, but that is, of course, always the challenge in times of war and in times of stress, whatever the cause. I think it is the obligation of the courts to remember, just as really the model of the D.C. Circuit, from our earliest case, when the treason trial of Aaron Burr, to calmly poise the scales of justice. The emphasis is on calmly. It requires a certain dispassion, a certain separation from the passions of the moment.

It’s one of those cases that I don’t think it’s technically been overruled yet, but I think it’s widely recognized as not having precedential value. I do think the result in that case— Korematsu was actually the—considered the exclusion and not the actual detention, but the exclusion of individuals based on their ethnic/racial background from vast areas. It’s hard for me to comprehend the argument that that would be acceptable these days. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes.

Well, I’m sure there are some, Senator, and when you have the benefit of 50 or 60 years to look back as opposed to the particular demands of the moment and the perceived demands, I’m sure it’s a different perspective. I’d hesitate to mention any in particular because so many of these issues are coming before not only the Supreme Court, but the court on which I now sit, and I will have to confront those cases, I think, regardless of what happens here. So I’d hesitate to identify particular areas of concern.

Again, Senator, that is something that could come before the Court in one form or another and I think I have to refrain from commenting on it.

Well, yes, certainly, at a basic level of appreciating that this is a reaction in a particular way that raises serious questions. I’m very hesitant, though, again, to express a view on legality because those issues could come before the Court. They are coming before the Court, and they’re coming not only before the Supreme Court, but the court on which I now sit.

Well, Senator, that does get into the area of asking me to comment on which opinions I think are correct that I don’t feel it’s appropriate for me to go. I do know that the approachin this area is the approach set forth by Justice Jackson in his concurring opinion in the Youngstown case. That has set the framework for consideration of questions of Executive power in times of war and with respect to foreign affairs since it was decided.And as you know, the issue in those cases and in many of the cases in the Supreme Court is whether Congress has endorsed the Executive action, in which case the President has his powers and the powers of Congress; whether Congress has prohibited the Executive action, in which case all he has is whatever residual authority he has less the power of Congress; or what often happens, that vast middle area where it’s impossible to tell or there’s argument about whether Congress has approved the action or not.The Dames and Moore case that was decided in 1981 is an example of that, when to resolve the Iranian hostage crisis the President abrogated claims and relegated those with claims to the Iranian Claims Tribunal. The issue there, the Court looked back at a variety of congressional enactments going way back to the Civil War to try to determine if this type of exercise of authority is something Congress endorsed or opposed.

Well, again, I don’t remember which of those opinions follows the Youngstown analysis the most closely. My understanding of the appropriate approach in this area is that it is the Youngstown analysis, the one set forth in Justice Jackson’s concurring opinion, and I think that is the most appropriate way to flesh out the issues. You do need to understand, because this is an area in which judges need to understand, there is often conflict between the branches and you do need to at least set the table correctly to understand, is the President acting with congressional support, against it, or do we have to try to determine which of those areas it is? And I think you do need to lay that analysis out before deciding the case.

Well, Senator, you’ve touched upon an area in which I cannot comment under the—that case is still pending. It’s pending before the Supreme Court. Under the Judicial Canons of Ethics, Canon 3–A(6), I’m not supposed to comment publicly in any way about a case that’s still pending.

Well, the issue involves the same sort of issues that you began the discussion with, the question of civil liberties in wartime, and certainly I understand people having strong views on that particular question. But whether the decision on the merits was correctly resolved or not, or anything about it, I’m just absolutely prohibited from talking about it by those judicial canons. There’s even an advisory opinion that explains that that canon applies to a Senate confirmation hearing. So my ethical obligation not to comment publicly on a case that’s still pending prevents me from saying anything more.

Well, certainly— 

Well, I certainly don’t minimize the significance of a decision by a court of appeals or by the Supreme Court about the scope of Executive authority in this area, about its impact on individual liberties, about the issues of separation of powers and whether the relation between the Congress and the Executive— whether the Executive is acting with congressional endorsement and support or in the face of congressional opposition. Those, of course, are very sensitive issues and always have been throughout our history. I certainly appreciate that. Those are significant matters. It’s just that I’m prohibited from talking about the substance of the case. 

Senator, that, again, is a question I can’t answer for you. I can’t address that. There’s a motion pending in the Court seeking to file a petition to recuse, and that motion is pending. It’s a matter I can’t talk about outside of the judicial process.In addition, because the Hamdan case itself is still pending, I don’t think that’s appropriate for me to address that.

Senator— 

Senator, we’re talking about the canons of judicial ethics. They’re quite clear on the subject. They say I may not talk about a matter that’s pending before the Court. 

That matter is still—is pending before the Court. My hands are tied. It’s not something I can discuss under the canons of ethics. 

I think the gains under the Voting Rights Act have been very beneficial in promoting the right to vote, which is preservative of all other rights. The issue about how to extend the Voting Rights Act, again, my position was a member of the staff in the Justice Department. The administration position of extending the Voting Rights Act for the longest period in history, as is, without change, was in no sense reflective of any disagreement with the proposition that the Voting Rights Act was extremely valuable in securing not just the right to vote but all other rights—

Well, I think some of them would have. I don’t know if all of them would have. It’s obviously impossible to tell, to go back and determine whether a particular application of a different approach would have had the same results or different results. I think that’s very hard to tell.

Senator, my personal view of the Voting Rights Act was not something somebody was interested in. You have people who serve on your staff, and their job is to help you implement your views as a Senator. I am just—

Senator, I haven’t studied the Voting Rights Act to determine whether the intent test or the effects test would have different results in different cases under Section 2. I’m in no position to make a judgment on that.

Senator, you keep referring to what I supported and what I wanted to do. I was a 26-year-old staff lawyer. It was my first job as a lawyer after my clerkships. I was not shaping administration policy. The administration policy was shaped by the Attorney General on whose staff I served. It was the policy of President Reagan. It was to extend the Voting Rights Act without change for the longest period in history at that point, and it was my job to promote the Attorney General’s view and the President’s view on that issue. And that’s what I was doing.

Well, Senator, I haven’t followed the issue or the particular litigation. I had involvement in some litigation when I was in the Solicitor General’s office, in which we were effective in proving violations under the Voting Rights Act. Many of those cases arose under issues under Section 5, pre-clearance issues, and not under Section 2.I as a judge had a case, a three-judge district court case, again, arising under the pre-clearance provisions, but I’m certainly not an expert in the area and haven’t followed and have no way of evaluating the relative effectiveness of the law as amended or the last as it was prior to 1982.

Well, I’ll answer that question, but before I do so, the position I advanced in the Gonzaga case prevailed. The argument that we made on behalf of the university—I was obviously representing the university’s position, and they prevailed before the Supreme Court.In the Wilder case, the determination to participate as an amicus was made by the Solicitor General, and I don’t recall a particular role in that case. I worked on the brief. I presented the argument. We lost that case 5–4. It was a close issue. All of these issues go to the question of what Congress intended to do. If Congress had spelled out whether or not a right should be enforceable in Court, that is what the determination would be in Court. These issues arise only because of confusion over whether or not Congress has spelled out that a right should be enforceable in Federal court for damages or not. And in the Wilder case, the Court determined 5– 4 that the right should be enforceable in Federal court. We were as an amicus supporting one of the States. I don’t remember which one it was. And the State was making the argument that there is— the right is—the issue in all of these cases is whether the right should be enforceable administratively as opposed to—

Well, the Gonzaga decision, which resulted— there were various arguments made in the brief. The ruling of the Court was in favor of the university that I was representing. And the determination in the Gonzaga case about what should be shown and what has to be shown is one of the precedents of the Court that I would follow, as any other, consistent with rules of stare decisis. That’s not an area in which I have any particular view. I’ve argued both sides of that issue. On behalf of plaintiffs, I argued in favor of it, and on behalf of defendants, against it.Again, the issue is not the enforceability, as in Gonzaga. The issue was should individuals be allowed to bring suit as opposed to action by, in that case, the Department of Education.

That’s how I made my living, Senator. 

Sometimes it’s easier than others. 

And sometimes it’s hard to read the tea leaves. 

He is certainly someone from whom I learned a great deal, yes.

Well, you know, I think if you were able to ask him, he would talk about being a grandfather, being a father, being a husband.

But the important point is that those were important things in his life, and he appreciated the need to recognize that those are the most important things. With respect to the law, to which he devoted his professional life, I think a big part of the legacy that he leaves is a Supreme Court in which all of the members respected and admired him because of his fairness in administering the Court and conducting the important responsibilities like managing the Conference, and assigning opinions. You can go back in history and look at what other Chief Justices did. Some were, in terms of that administrative responsibility, some were disasters. You look at Harlan Stone. His idea of running the Conference, he said what he thought, then the next senior Justice said what he thought, then Justice Stone critiqued that. Then the next Justice, and then Justice Stone critiqued that. And the result was the conferences went on for days, and everybody ended up hating each other. 

I think he was a very effective advocate on the bench for a view of the Constitution that is one of limited and separated powers— 

I do. I think that the—now, I have to tell you that whether as a judge on the court of appeals, or if I am confirmed on the Supreme Court, I will certainly be my own man, and there are— 

Well, you know, I admire the late Chief Justice very much, but I will have to insist that I will be my own man,and I hesitate to be put in anybody’s mold, and I would certainly approach the cases according to the judicial philosophy that I have developed over the years. In many respects it’s similar to his, in its recognition I think of the limited role that judges should have, and of sufficient and appropriate modesty and humility, a recognition that—

Given my view of the role of a judge, which focuses on the appropriate modesty and humility, the notion of dramatic departures is not one that I would hold out much hope for.

Well, I’d hope what he meant by that is somebody who’s going to be faithful to the text of the Constitution, to the intent of those who drafted it, while appreciating that sometimes the phrases they used, they were drafting a Constitution for the ages to secure the blessings of liberty for their posterity, they were looking ahead, and so they often used phrases that they intended to have a—

No. 

Well, it means to me generally a change in attitude. President Reagan always presented an optimistic view. He always told us that the best days of our country were ahead of us, and he reasserted basic fundamental truths in areas like foreign relations. We were going to stand up to the Soviet Union. We’re proud of our system of Government. That’s the right approach, not the Soviet approach. And people who have come of age after the Berlin Wall has fallen sometimes don’t understand what it meant at that time. 

I think it means a belief that we should interpret the Constitution according to its terms, that judges don’t shape policy, that judges interpret the law, and that legislators shape policy. The executive branch executes the law. 

President Reagan’s policy was opposed to quotas, which were much more rigid at the time. People need to ap-preciate, 24 years ago the idea of a quota was a rigid set aside. We now have the recent Supreme Court decisions talking about consideration of particular factors as one factor in an affirmative action program. President Reagan was in favor of affirmative action, and he was opposed to quotas.

The proposal was to extend it for the longest period in history without change.

Section 2. 

There was a compromise in the test under Section 2, which is articulated in a paragraph describing what the criteria are and including a caution that this should not be read to promote proportional representation which was some of the concern that the Attorney General and President Reagan had. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I don’t know. I mean I wouldn’t— 

Well— [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. We had the Flag Protection Act after the Supreme Court concluded that it was protected speech. 

Well, it’s not, and— 

That’s something it’s probably inappropriate for me to comment on. 

His view was that voluntary school prayer was appropriate. 

Well, again, Senator, these are issues that are likely to come before the Court, and I cannot comment on those particulars because— 

Well, again, those are issues that come before the Court on a regular basis in particular cases, and whether on my current court or the future court, I need to be able to approach those cases with an open mind and not on the basis of statements I make during a confirmation hearing. 

I have seen some things, yes. 

Well, some of the mischaracterizations, you know, you get annoyed at them. I don’t like them. Some of the things you see, you get pretty upset about. 

They’re—I would say they get upset about some of the things, as well— 

It is and it’s an expression I’ve been using a lot lately. It is a free country and it’s a good thing that it is.

I think it is a very serious threat to the independence and integrity of the courts to politicize them. I think that is not a good development, to regard the courts as simply an extension of the political process. That’s not what they are.I’ve been fortunate for the past 2 years to serve on a court in which all of the judges, and they come—in the D.C. Circuit, they come from very active careers and public life, sometimes very identified politically, but it’s a court where those judges put aside those ties and those views and become judges all focused on the same mission of vindicating the rule of law.And if you look at the decisions on the D.C. Circuit, you’ll see that we are almost always unanimous. We almost always come out the same way. And to the extent there are disagreements, they don’t shape up along political lines. That is an ideal. But the more and more that the process becomes politicized, the less likely that that’s going to happen.

You know, it’s a tradition of the American Bar that goes back before the founding of the country that lawyers are not identified with the positions of their clients. The most famous example probably was John Adams, who represented the British soldiers charged in the Boston Massacre. He did that for a reason, because he wanted to show that the Revolution in which he was involved was not about overturning the rule of law, it was about vindicating the rule of law.Our Founders thought that they were not being given their rights under the British system to which they were entitled, and by representing the British soldiers, he helped show that what they were about was defending the rule of law, not undermining it, and that principle, that you don’t identify the lawyer with the particular views of the client, or the views that the lawyer advances on behalf of the client, is critical to the fair administration of justice.

I do think there is an unfortunate tendency to attack lawyers because of the positions they press on behalf of clients and I think that’s unfortunate.

Certainly. 

I don’t know that I could comment on that, but it’s—they have a consistent position of promoting civil liberties and a particular view on that. 

It might make it a little harder. [Laughter.] 

Well, you know, the rule of law is always vulnerable because the Supreme Court, as has been pointed out often in history, has only the persuasive power of its opinions to command respect. There have been famous episodes in the past, you know, President Jackson, Chief Justice Marshall has given his opinion, let’s see him enforce it, other episodes of that sort. But over time, the legitimacy of the Supreme Court has been established and it’s generally recognized across the political spectrum that it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is and that the other branches have the obligation to obey what the Supreme Court says the law is.The one threat, I think, to the rule of law is a tendency on behalf of some judges to take that legitimacy and that authority and extend it into areas where they’re going beyond the interpretation of the Constitution, where they’re making the law. And because it’s the Supreme Court, people are going to follow it even though they’re making the law. The judges have to recognize that their role is a limited one. That is the basis of their legitimacy.I have said it before and I will just repeat myself. The Framers were not the sort of people, having fought a revolution to get the right of self-government, to sit down and say, let’s take all the difficult issues before us and let’s have the judges decide them. That would have been the farthest thing from their mind. The judges had the obligation to decide cases and the authority to interpret the Constitution because they had to decide cases and they were going to decide those cases according to the law, not according to their personal preferences.Judges have to have the courage to make the unpopular decisions when they have to. That sometimes involves striking down Acts of Congress. That sometimes involves ruling that acts of the Executive are unconstitutional. That is a requirement of the judicial oath. You have to have that courage. But you also have to have the self-restraint to recognize that your role is limited to interpreting the law and doesn’t include making the law.

I’d like them to start by saying he was confirmed.[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. Whether they say that or not, I would like it— the answer is the same. I would like them to say I was a good judge.

I do disagree with that conclusion, Senator. I think it’s perfectly appropriate for people to criticize decisions of judges. That comes with the territory. It’s a healthy thing. That type of criticism and analysis, saying the judge got it wrong, the court got it wrong, is healthy and good. And the only thing I would say is I’m not sure whether that criticism is along that line or— but personal attacks on judges for doing their best to live up to the judicial oath, that is something that I don’t think is appropriate. 

Oh, it’s not an analysis— 

I don’t agree with that, and all I’m saying is that I think people have a right to be critical of judges, but attacks on judicial independence are not appropriate because judges—and certainly even judges with whom I disagree on the results or particular merits, they should not be attacked for their decisions. Thedecisions can be criticized, but attacking the judges I think is not appropriate.

Senator, I said yesterday that, if confirmed, I would be vigilant to protect the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court and the judicial branch, and that is true. An independent judiciary is one of the keys to safeguarding the rule of law. Again, I said that yesterday, and I believe that. And to the extent the judiciary is attacked, I will be vigilant to respond and defend it.

You know, again, I don’t agree with them, but it’s a free country. They’re free to say what they wish. But the issue of impeachment was resolved in the Salmon Chase hearings. The basic principle was established. You don’t impeach judges if you disagree with their decisions. That’s not what the impeachment provision is.

Well, I would do what I can, Senator, to make it clear to people—and I do think it’s an important educating function that what judges do promotes the rule of law and that the rule of law preserves liberties for all Americans. I’m obviously not going to infringe anybody’s First Amendment rights. People are free to say what they—

Senator, people from all across the political spectrum have attacked judges. They do it now. I’ve seen some very virulent attacks from all over the political spectrum, and certainly throughout history. Again, judges can stand the criticism of their opinions, but personal attacks I think are beyond the pale.

Yes. 

Yes. 

Well, the Court, for example, I think most recently in the Glucksberg case, talked about the necessity of considering our Nation’s history, traditions, and practices. As Justice Harlan always explained in his opinions, you need to do that with an appropriate sensitivity to the limitations on the judicial role. Again, you need to recognize that it is not your job to make policy, either under the Constitution or under the statutes. You are interpreting the Constitution. And the appropriate judicial role focuses on those considerations, tradition and history and practice, as developed in the Court’s precedents. And that’s where I would start. In any case where the issue came up as to whether or not a particular issue was presented under the Due Process Clause, you begin with the precedents. You analyze them under principles of stare decisis, the precedents in this area, just like precedents in any other area, and analyze them in light of those different factors. All the Justices recognize that in this area they are—you need to be especially careful about the source of the content that you’re giving to the right at issue, because it is an area in which the dan-ger of judges going beyond their appropriately limited authority is presented because of the nature of the sources of authority. You’re not construing the text narrowly. You’re not looking at a particular statute with legislative history.All of the Justices recognize that it presents particular challenges.

Well, Senator, in that particular memo, for example, it was a play on the standard practice of many politicians, including President Reagan, when he was talking to a Hispanic audience, he would throw in some language in Spanish. Again, the memos were from me to Fred Fielding. I think Mr. Fielding always found the tone— 

It was meant to convey the notion—again, as I’ve described—that when politicians speak to a particular audience in that language, is that offensive to the audience? It was meant to convey that. It was an issue concerning a particular radio interview. You know, the tone was, I think, generally appropriate for a memo from me to Mr. Fielding, and I know that he never suggested that it was anything other than appropriate. 

Well, Senator, I think some 80,000 pages have been released of memoranda that I wrote—

Well, I don’t—you know, I have not gone back and re-evaluated all those policies, no. I do know, though, for example, in the area of civil rights, people have talked about memos I wrote about the administration’s policy against busing or the administration’s policy against quotas. Being against busing and being against quotas is not the same as being against civil rights. President Reagan was against busing. President Reagan was against quotas. But he was in favor of civil rights, and that was the administration position that I was advancing in those memoranda. 

Yes. 

Well, that’s obviously the Court’s holding in Wickard v. Filburn, and reaffirmed recently to a large extent in the Raich case. But I would say that because it has come up again so recently in the Raich case that it’s an area where I think it’s inappropriate for me to comment on my personal view about whether it’s correct or not. That’s unlike an issue under Marbury v. Madison or Brown v. Board of Education, which I don’t think is likely to come up again before the Court. This was just before the Court last year, and so I should, I think, avoid commenting on whether I think it’s correct or not. 

No, not on Wickard. 

Well, Senator— 

Well, Senator, all you have to do is look at the arguments, the briefs in the Raich case where that was the issue that was argued, whether or not Wickard v. Filburn was still good law, whether or not Wickard v. Filburn should be applied in that situation. Nobody in recent years has been arguing whether Marbury v. Madison is good law. Nobody has been arguing whether Brown v.Board of Education was good law. They have been arguing whether Wickard v. Filburn is good law. Now, it was reaffirmed in the Raich case and that is a precedent of the Court, just like Wickard, that I would apply like any other precedent. I have no agenda to overturn it. I have no agenda to revisit it. It’s a precedent of the Court.But I do think it’s a bit much to say it’s on the same plane as a precedent as Marbury v. Madison and Brown v. Board of Education—

Or Griswold. The fact that it was just reconsidered and reargued last year in the Raich case suggests that it’s not that same type of case, and that’s why I’m uncomfortable commenting on it. I have gone farther than many other nominees in talking about cases like Marbury, like Brown, like Griswold, because I thought it was appropriate given the fact that those issues are not, in my view, likely to come before the Court again. Here’s an issue that was just before the Court last year, so I can’t say that it’s unlikely to come before the Court again and, therefore, I think it falls in the category of cases in which I should tell you I recognize it as a precedent of the Court. I have no agenda to overturn it or revisit it. But beyond that, I think it’s inappropriate to comment. 

And I’m not expressing— 

I’m not expressing any hostility to the proposition at all. All I’m telling you is that this is a case that was challenged, the application, in the Raich case last year. And to say that it’s in the same category as Marbury or Brown, I think is inaccurate. 

And so perhaps I should have taken the approach Justice Scalia took. He wouldn’t tell this Committee whether Marbury was correctly decided. 

Well, and then the reward for not doing that is to have additional cases that are very current in terms of the litigation before the Court, and the idea, as well, you said what you thought about Marbury. What do you think about the Raich case, which just reaffirmed Wickard v. Filburn? There are two very different parameters. My approach has been a practical one, not an ideological one, but a practical one, but saying—

Well, Wickard was litigated directly in the Raich case. I don’t think the issue in Griswold is likely to come before the Court. It was unlikely—

Well, that’s one of the issues, but the difference between the issue that was presented in Griswold and its ramifications of the analysis, those are two very different issues.

I think that sounds a lot like the Raich case, where the Court determined the medical marijuana issue even though the regulation of marijuana as an illicit drug—it had interstate impact even if the medical provision of it did not, and so they were willing to look beyond and apply the Wickard case, which they reaffirmed the suitability, and conclude that that had a significant effect on commerce, the regulation in general. You didn’t have to look at the specific regulation.It would seem to me that that— 

Well, in Viejo, you’re dealing with particular species, and the difficulty—and again, it was what another court had looked at, not the activity that was regulated, the interference with the species, but the activity that was taking place and having that impact, the building of a housing development. Other courts, the Fifth Circuit in the GDF case, had argued that the approach of looking at the housing development rather than the particular activity was inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions, and what I said is that if there’s another basis on which to evaluate it, and there was, and the panel opinion noted, we don’t have to reach these other grounds because of our conclusion, that we should focus on those other alternative grounds and see if we could base and uphold the Act on those. 

Well, I think I agree with your point about the danger of analogies in some situations. It’s not the last, because they are balls and strikes regardless, and if I call them one and they are the other, that doesn’t change what they are. It just means that I got it wrong. I guess I like the one in the middle because I do think there are right answers. I know that it’s fashionable in some places to suggest that there are no right answers and that the judges are motivated by a constellation of different considerations, and because of that it should affect how we approach certain other issues. That’s not the view of the law that I subscribe to.I think when you folks legislate, you do have something in mind in particular, and you put it into words, and you expect judges not to put in their own preference, not to substitute their judgment for you, but to implement your view of what you are accomplishing in that statute.I think when the Framers framed the Constitution it was the same thing, and the judges are not to put in their own personal views about what the Constitution should say, but they are supposed to interpret it and apply the meaning that is in the Constitution, and I think there is meaning there, and I think there is meaning in your legislation, and the job of a good judge is to do as good a job as possible to get the right answer.Again, I know there are those theorists who think that is futile, or because it is hard in particular cases, we should just throw up our hands and not try in any case, and I do not subscribe to that. I believe that there are right answers, and judges, if they work hard enough, are likely to come up with them.

My understanding, based on reading the transcript, not just of Justice Ginsburg’s hearing but of the hearings for every one of the Justices on the Court, is that that was her approach, that she would generally decline to comment on whether she viewed particular cases as correctly decided or not. She at one point said that that was the Court’s precedent, she had no agenda to reconsider it, and that was all she was going to say. And in areas where she had written, she thought it was appropriate to discuss more fully because it was an area that she had already publicly commented on, and I understand that to be the distinction as to why she commented on particular areas but not others.

It is, Senator, with an exception, and the exception is that I have tried to be—to share more of my views with respect to particular cases. I know other nominees have declined, for example, to comment on even a case like Marbury v. Madison because they thought as a theoretical matter it could come before the Court. I tend to take a more practical and pragmatic approach to things, rather than a theoretical or ideological approach. I think as a practical matter, an issue about Marbury v. Madison is not likely to come before the Court, the same with Brown v. Board of Education, so I have gone farther than many nominees and have been willing to talk about my views on those particular cases.But I do think when it gets into an area where the correctness or incorrectness or my agreement or disagreement with a particular precedent is an area that is likely to come before the Court or could well come before the Court, I do have to draw the line there, and it is not out of any interest to dodge questions or anything. My views on cases that I think are not likely to come before the Court, I’m perfectly willing to discuss. It’s based on the concern that the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court depends upon Justices who go there and will decide the issues there with an open mind based on the judicial decisional process, not based on prior commitments they made during the nomination hearing.All of the Justices have adhered to that approach for that reason, and if I am to join their number, I need to be able to look them in the eye in the conference room and say, ‘‘I kept the same faith with the independence and integrity of this Court.’’

No, Senator. It’s saying a judge is result oriented, that type of judge. That’s about the worst thing you can say about a judge.

It’s about the worst thing you can say because what you’re saying is, you don’t apply the law to tell you what the results should be. You don’t go through the judicial decisional process. You don’t look to the principles that are established in the Constitution or the law. You look to what you think the result should be, and then you go back and try to rationalize it, and that’s not the way the system is supposed to work.

What the Supreme Court has said, in the Casey decision, for example, is that it is not an inexorable command. In other words, it’s not an absolute rule, and that’s why they have these various cases that explain the circumstances under which you should revisit a prior precedent that you think may be flawed and when you shouldn’t, and—

I was just going to say there are significant cases in the Court’s history, in the Nation’s history, where the Court has revisited precedents like Brown v. Board of Education, like the cases that overruled the decisions of the Lochner era.

That’s right. It is a neutral principle. The factors that the Court looks at in deciding whether to overrule prior precedent or not do not depend upon what the decision is or what area it’s in, other than some areas, things we’ve talked about, for example, a statutory decision is much more likely to be overturned thana constitutional decision just because Congress can address those issues themselves.But the principles of stare decisis are neutral and should be applied in a neutral way to cases without regard to the substance of the decisions being considered.

No, Senator, and I’ve tried as scrupulously as possible today to avoid making any commitments about cases that might come before the Court.

Yes, Senator, and I do think that a proper consideration of Lopez and Morrison has to take into account the more recent Supreme Court decision in Raich, where the Court made the point that, yes, we have these decisions in Lopez and Morrison, but they are part of a 218-year history of decisions applying the Commerce Clause, and they need to be taken into account in the broad scope. It’s an appreciation, again, the first one in 65, 70 years that recognized a limitation on what was within the Congress’s power.But they’re not sort of—they didn’t junk all the cases that came before. They didn’t set a new standard. That’s what the Court said in Raich. It said, yes, we have those two cases, don’t over-read them. Put them in the context and, you know, move on from there. And as the Court in Raich concluded, they upheld the exercise of Congress’s authority.

Yes, Senator, I did. 

Well, I think it’s important, first of all, to appreciate that the issue in the Herrera case I think was misportrayed as an issue of actual innocence. The issue in the Herrera case is at what point should new claims—in this case, the claim after his brother died, well, guess what, I didn’t do it, my brother did it, and he’s dead now. That is to some extent a claim of innocence, but it’s the sort of claim that did not have, as the courts determined there, sufficient factual support to be taken seriously. That’s quite different from a claim, for example, of DNA evidence. Now, that’s an issue that’s working its way up, and I don’t want to comment on it, other than to say that it seems to me that that type of claim— that somebody who just died was the actual murderer is different from the scientific issue. They’re just different cases. So I don’t think that one should be taken as suggesting a view on the other.Obviously, any case involving the death penalty is different. The Court has recognized that. The irrevocability calls for the most careful scrutiny. It is not an area in which I’ve had to consider cases as a judge up to this point, and I certainly know the magnitude of the concern and the scrutiny that all the Justices bring to that question. It’s just different than other cases. There’s no doubt about that. And DNA evidence obviously I think is a very important and critical issue. No one wants an innocent person executed, period. And the availability of that type of evidence, that opportunity in some cases, I think is something that’s a very significant development in the law.Now, as I said, there are cases coming up in there, so I don’t want to say anything further.

There certainly were internal disagreements and internal disputes about which approach to take, and in many cases, I’d be on one side; in other cases, I’d be on the other side, certainly.Now, again, those are internal deliberations, but there was debate and disagreement on a regular basis. That’s part of the nature of the job.

Senator, I was ethically barred from taking a position on that case. I was just coming off of my clerkship on the Supreme Court, which ended in the summer of 1981. Supreme Court rules said that you could not participate in any way in a matter before the Supreme Court for a certain period of time—I think it was 2 years, or whatever it was—and it was within that period. This involved an issue before the Supreme Court. So I was ethically barred from participating in that in any way.

No, Senator. 

I was not involved in the policy because of the bar on the participation. 

Sure. 

Yes. 

Right. 

No, Senator. In retrospect, I think it’s clear. The people who were involved in it, as you say, themselves think that it was the incorrect position. I certainly don’t disagree with that. 

The answer is, no, I don’t think it was the correct position to take. 

Well, the Lemon test is a survivor. There’s no other way to put it. When we wrote the brief in Lee v. Weisman, we had a long footnote explaining that, I think it was six different members of the current Court had expressed their criticisms of the Lemon test. They never got together at the same time and the test has endured.The approach that we were advocating in Lee v. Weisman did focus on the question of coercion and argued that in certain circumstances, a recognition of ceremonial religious practices—an invocation at a graduation was the one at issue there—were permissible, and again, that, I think, lost five-to-four.And the Lemon test to this day is the test that the Court applies. I think one of the Justices recently explained, you know, it’s not so much how good the Lemon test is, it’s that nobody can agree on an alternative to take its place, and there may be something to that. There are cases where the Court doesn’t apply the Lemon test. It seems to follow a different approach.The great benefit of the Lemon test, the three-part test that everybody’s familiar with, of course, is that it’s very sensitive to factual nuances. The disadvantage of the Lemon test, I think, is that it’s very sensitive to factual nuances and you get a situation like with the Ten Commandments case, and again, I’m not commenting on the correctness or not, but those are two decisions and there is exactly one Justice that thinks they’re both right.Nobody would suggest that this is an area of the law where the Court’s precedents are crystal clear, and I think there may be some inevitability to that. There is a tension of sorts between the Establishment Clause, on the one hand, and the Free Exercise Clause on the other, and the Court’s cases in recent years have tried to consider when is an accommodation for religious belief—when does that go too far and become an establishment of religion? The Court has a case on its docket coming up.I think the animating principle of the Framers that’s reflected in both of the religion clauses is that no one should be denied rights of full citizenship because of their religious belief or their lack of religious belief. That is the underlying principle. That is, I think, what the Framers were trying to accomplish.The jurisprudence, again, it’s an area where the Court has adhered through thick and thin to the Lemon test, probably because they can’t come up with anything better, but the results sometimes, I think, are a little difficult to comprehend.

Well, I don’t think I’ve had an Establishment Clause case. The cases where I have argued, I obviously was representing the position of the administration, which was that the Lemon test was regarded by the administration as too manipulable, not determinative, and in some senses inconsistent. So those—with the understanding of the Framers. So that was the position that we were advocating there. I haven’t expressed my personal views on the Establishment Clause in any context.

I don’t think I’ve said that. Seenator DURBIN. Well, that’s correct. Strike that from the record. Let me just say you were a staff attorney reflecting the views of the administration you worked for. Is that a correct characterization? Judge ROBERTS. It’s a correct view. The views of the administration were quite clear with respect to the moment of silence, which was the issue in Wallace v. Jaffree. It was the President’s view that it was constitutional, through the Attorney General, that it was constitutional to observe a moment of silence. Now, what the Court held in Wallace, of course, was that you couldn’t look at just the moment of silence. There was a history there about school-led prayer, and to substitute it and suddenly say, well, now it is a moment of silence, they didn’t look at it in those terms but looked at it in the long history and the issue of whether a real moment of silence without that kind of background and history, whether that would prevail or not was one that the Court didn’t address in Wallace. 

Yes. The Court’s decisions in that area are quite clear, and I think the Framers’ intent was, as well, that it was not their intent to just have a protection for denominational discrimination. It was their intent to leave this as an area of privacy apart—a conscience from which the Government would not intrude. 

Well, Senator, I would just say that my demonstrated commitment to the rule of law, you can see that, I think, in my opinions over the past 2 years, you can see it in how I approach my job as a lawyer, arguing, and what types of arguments I make and how I make those arguments and how faithful they are to the precedents, and you can see it in my history of public service.The idea that the rule of law—that’s the only client I have as a judge. The Constitution is the only interest I have as a judge. The notion that I would compromise my commitment to that principle that has been the lodestar of my professional life since I became a lawyer because of views toward a particular administration is onethat I reject entirely. That would be inconsistent with the judicial oath, and Justice Jackson is a perfect example of that. He is someone who was a strong advocate for Executive power when he was FDR’s Attorney General, one of the strongest, and yet he could issue a decision like the Youngstown decision not only concluding that President Truman lacked the authority, even in times of war, to seize the steel mills, but also setting forth the framework with the language of the sort that you just quoted, setting forth the framework about how to analyze these decisions in a way that is particularly sensitive to the role of Congress, as well. That is the key feature of his framework, the examination of where Congress is on the spectrum in determining whether the Executive has that authority.

No, Senator, not simply because of the conflict, and I have to say I don’t know—that’s one of the 80,000 memos I don’t know about, so I’d have to understand what the point was, what the issue was, and the language you read in context before I could respond to that.But, no, the President has an obligation. He takes an oath, as we all do, to uphold the Constitution and to make a determination, and his determination that certain things are either constitutional or unconstitutional can, of course, in an appropriate case be tested in court. And the ultimate arbiter of that under our system is the Federal judiciary.

Yes, I do. It simply reflects the basic principle that no man is above the law, not the President and not the Congress. And that’s why courts have the obligation and have had since Marbury v. Madison to say what the law is. And if that means that Congress has acted unconstitutionally, they strike down the law. And if it means that the Executive has acted unconstitutionally, they have the obligation to block the Executive action.

Well, I can tell you what the Court has done. There are Justices who aren’t comfortable with the different tiers. They say there’s one Equal Protection Clause. But the different tiers are fairly well establish as an approach to the different areas in discrimination. And the rationale for it is that there are areas in which you think it is almost never the case that distinctions that are drawn can be legitimate, distinctions based on race or ethnicity. And so they’re subject to the most heightened scrutiny.The rational relation test which applies across the board to any type of law, there it’s quite often the case that distinctions drawn on whatever basis Congress wants are likely to reflect the different sorts of policy judgments.Gender issues are in the middle tier because the Court thinks that there are situations where distinctions can be justified, and there are other situations—but it’s more than just the rational relation, but not as suspect as the most heightened level because there may be other justifications. Cases throughout the Court’s history where they have upheld distinctions under that analysis, like the all-male draft, for example, that was upheld.Now, if you had applied strict scrutiny to that type of classification, perhaps the result would have been different and the all-male draft would have been struck down. It reflects the Court’s determination that these are not sort of almost always inherently irrational and discrimination rather than legitimate governmental distinctions, but that it’s entitled to a heightened degree of scrutiny beyond the rational relation test. Justice Ginsburg, I think, in her opinion in the VMI case said that the intermediate scrutiny had to be applied with—I forget the exact phrase—‘‘exacting rigor’’ or282 something along those lines, to indicate that it is well beyond the rational relation test, but it’s not as inherently suspect as racial classifications.

Thank you, Senator. 

Good morning. 

Well, under the Kelo decision, which, as you explained, was interpreting the public use requirement in the Constitution, the majority—and, of course, as you mentioned, it was a closely divided case. The majority explained its reasoning by noting the difficulty in drawing the line. Everybody would agree, as you suggest, to build a road or to build a railroad, to situate a military base, if that is the only suitable place, that the power of eminent domain is appropriate in those instances. And I think people agree further that when you’re talking about a hospital or something like that, that satisfies public use. And I think the reason the Court gave, really, in the majority opinion was that it’s kind of hard to draw the line.The dissent, Justice O’Connor’s dissent, didn’t think it was that hard. She focused on the question of whether it was going to be a use open to the public as, you know, a road, a hospital, use for the public like in a military base, or private. And she would have drawn the line there and said even public benefits that derive from different private uses don’t justify that aspect of it.There was a caveat in the Kelo majority. They said they were only deciding this in the context of an urban redevelopment plan. They reserved the question—if it’s just taking one parcel and giving it to everybody else, not part of a broader plan, that question was still open. And as you say, there’s been a lot of reaction to it. I understand some States have even legislated restricting their power.

And I think that’s a very appropriate approach to consider. In other words, the Court was not saying you have to have this power, you have to exercise this power. What the Court was saying is there is this power, and then it’s up to the legislatureto determine whether it wants that to be available, whether it wants it to be available in limited circumstances, or whether it wants to go back to an understanding as reflected in the dissent, that this is not an appropriate public use.That leaves the ball in the court of the legislature, and I think it’s reflective of what is often the case and people sometimes lose sight of, that this body and legislative bodies in the States are protectors of the people’s rights as well. It’s not simply a question of legislating to address particular needs, but you obviously have to also be cognizant of the people’s rights and you can protect them in situations where the Court has determined, as it did 5–4 in Kelo, that they are not going to draw that line. You still have the authority to draw—

Well, you know, the first year in law school we all read the decision in Calder v. Bull, which has the famous statement that the Government may not take the property of A and give it to B. And that certainly was quoted in the dissent, in Justice O’Connor’s dissent. The Kelo majority, though, said if a legislature wants to exercise that power, basically that the Court’s not going to second-guess the judgment that this is a public use. And I do think that imposes a heavy responsibility on the legislature to determine what they’re doing and whether it is a public use or if it’s simply transferring from one private party to the next. But—

Well, the Kelo decision obviously was just decided last year, and I don’t think I should comment whether it was correct or not. It stands as a precedent of the Court. It did leave open the question of whether it applied in the situation that was not a broader redevelopment plan. And if the issue does come back before the Court, I need to be able to address it without having previously commented on it.

Well, you know, Senator, that that writing was done at the request of the Attorney General, and he asked me specifically to present the arguments in favor of that power. He was receiving from elsewhere in the Department a memorandum saying that this was unconstitutional, the exercise of that authority. He wanted to see the other view before making up his mind for the Department, so I was tasked to present the arguments in favor of constitutionality. And as you say, they focus and start with the language in the Constitution, the Exceptions Clause, which is as you read it, and I went on to explain that it had been interpreted in the famous case of Ex parte McCardle around the time of the Civil War, which seemed to suggest that the Framers meant what that language says on its face. Also though, a later case, United States v. Klein suggested that there were limits on the power of Congress in this area.It is a central debate among legal scholars, the scope of that authority. The argument on the other side, the one that the Attorney General adopted, rather than the argument he asked me to present, is that it is the essential function of the Supreme Courtto provide uniformity and consistency in Federal law, and that if you carve out exceptions in its constitutional area, that you deprive it of that ability and that that itself violates the constitutional scheme. It’s an area in which most distinguished scholars line up on either side because it does call into question basic relationships between the Congress and the Courts.

The argument on the other side says that it’s intended to apply to—well, for example, we have clear situations in the lower Federal Courts like the amount-in-controversy, those cases are excluded. You can have rules about timing. The question is whether it was intended to address for constitutional areas or simply more administrative matters.The argument on the other side says if you get into the core constitutional areas, that undermines the Supreme Court’s authority that the Framers didn’t intend that.

Well, I think the primary check is the same one that Alexander Hamilton talked about in the Federalist Papers, because the exact argument was raising in the debates about the Constitution. People were concerned about a new judiciary, what was it going to do? They were concerned that it might deprive them of their rights. And of course, Hamilton’s famous answer was that judiciary was going to be the least dangerous branch because it had no power. It didn’t have the sword. It didn’t have the purse. And the judges were not going to be able to deprive people of their liberty because they were going to be bound down by rules and precedents. They were going to just interpret the law. And if judges just interpreted the law, there was no threat to liberty from the judicial branch.So I would say the primary check on the courts has always been judicial self-restraint, and a recognition on the part of judges that they have a limited task, that they are insulated from the people. They’re given life tenure, as you mentioned, precisely because they’re not shaping policy. They’re not supposed to be responsive. They’re supposed to just interpret the law.

Well, Senator, because cases are going to come up in this area, and that could be the focus of legal argument in those cases, I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to comment on that one way or another.I will confront issues in this area as I would confront issues in any area that come before the Court, and that would be to fully and fairly consider the arguments presented and decide them according to the rule of law. And I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to express views in an area that could come before the Court.

Well, Senator, I appreciate your thoughts on the subject very much. I do think, though, since those precise questions could come before the Court that that is in the area that I have to refrain from answering. 

Well, it makes the opportunity a very special one, as I’ve said before. The Chief was a mentor to many people, and like many great mentors, of course, he led by example, not by precept. His example of how he dealt with other people, not just other Justices but everybody in the courthouse, including the law clerks, in an open, friendly, balanced way was an example for everybody there.Substantively, his approach to the role of a judge and the appropriate role of the Court is, I think, a very important example. He was somebody who appreciated the limits, the appropriate limits on the judicial role and the judicial power, and he was always careful and conscious of that. He was always asking whether or not this was something that it was appropriate for the courts to do.I do think it’s important for judges at every level to always ask that question, because as we had talked earlier, judicial self-restraint is the key check on the authority of the court, and if you’re not asking yourself that question at every stage, is this an appropriate thing for me to do as a judge, then there’s a great danger that you’ll lose sight of that important judicial self-restraint.

Good morning. 

Well, I—for the reasons I stated yesterday, I don’t think it’s a good approach. I wouldn’t accuse judges or Justices who disagree with that, though, of violating their oath. I’d accuse them of getting it wrong on that point, and I’d hope to sit down with them and debate it and reason about it.I think that Justices who reach a contrary result on those questions are operating in good faith and trying, as I do on the court I am on now, to live up to that oath that you read. I wouldn’t want to suggest that they’re not doing that. Again, I would think they’re not getting it right in that particular case and with that particular approach and would hope to be able to sit down and argue with it, as I suspect they’d like to sit down and debate with me. But I wouldn’t suggest they’re not operating in good faith to comply with—

You know, I will follow the Supreme Court’s precedents consistent with the principles of stare decisis, and there are cases in this area, of course. That’s why we’re having the debate. The Court has looked at those. I think it’s fair to say, in the prior opinions, those are not determinative in the sense that the precedent turned entirely on foreign law, so it’s not a question of whether or not you’d be departing from these cases if you decided not to use foreign law. For the reasons I gave yesterday, I’m going to be looking—

Well, sitting where I am, I am not terribly inclined to be critical of the Congress—[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS.—and wouldn’t be in any event. But a lot of what judges spend their time doing, not always in the momentous constitutional cases that we’ve been talking about, but sometimes in very mundane cases, is the effort to discern congressional intent, trying to figure out what Congress meant when it used specific words that were passed by both Houses and signed by the President into law. Now, some of that is entirely unavoidable. The complexity of human endeavor is such that situations are going to arise that are not clearly answered by even the most specific language, and that’s to be expected and judges have to address those situations. But as you suggest yourself in your question, there are situations where sometimes Congress punts the issue to the courts. They can’t come to an agreement about how a particular provision should be applied, and so folks who wanted to go one way and folks who wanted to go the other way just sort of leave it ambiguous or leave it out and take their chances in court. Obviously, that’s a different situation. I think all judges would tell you that to the extent Congress can address the issues and resolve the issues that are the policy questions entrusted to them, it makes it a lot easier for the courts to decide the cases that do come up because then it’s just a question of looking at the facts and the law is clear and you apply the facts to the law. If the law is unclear, that makes it that much more difficult. As I said, obviously, a lot of these situations are unavoidable, but there are certainly—and the Supreme Court has addressed many of these, the issue of implied rights of action in the past, and they were doing case after case after case and they finally adopted an approach in the early 1980s that said, look, we’re not going to imply rights of action anymore. Congress, if you want somebody to have a right of action, just say so. But this is not a good thing for the courts to be doing, deciding whether a particular right of action should be implied or not. And after the Court developed that jurisprudence in the early 1980s, the hope was, and I think it has been realized to a large extent, that there will be more addressing of that question in Congress, which is where it should be addressed. 

Well, I’m sure everyone is doing as good a job as they can—

I don’t know the medical terms or definitions, but no. I mean, if that’s the law in the States—that’s not to say that it has any particular legal significance in cases— 

Yes. Again— [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I don’t mean to be overly cautious in answering— 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I joined Judge Randolph’s opinion. 

No. 

Well, I agree with Madison’s view in general that the Constitution does contain limitations on the Federal authority. The General Welfare Clause, and in particular the necessary and proper clause, of course, would have been interpreted in many of Chief Justice John Marshall’s early opinions to recognize though that the scope of authority given to Congress is broad, and broad enough to confront the problems that in Chief Justice John Marshall’s case were confronted by a young Nation and helped to bind it together as a Nation and broad enough today to confront the problems that Congress addresses. But the notion that the Constitution was one of limited powers, albeit broad, under the Necessary and Proper Clause and even the General Welfare Clause is interpreted by Chief Justice John Marshall in these early opinions, that recognition doesn’t undermine the Framers’ essential vision that we are dealing with a Federal system in which vast powers reside with the States, and that the Federal Government is one of limited powers, broad in obviously particular areas and broad under the Necessary and Proper Clause, but limited powers nonetheless.

I think the Framers, when they used broad language like ‘‘liberty,’’ like ‘‘due process,’’ like ‘‘unreasonable’’ with respect to searches and seizures, they were crafting a document that they intended to apply in a meaningful way down the ages. As they said in the preamble, it was designed to secure the blessings of liberty for their posterity, they intended it to apply to changing conditions, and I think that in that sense it is a concept that is alive in the sense that it applies and they intended it to apply in a particular way, but they intended it to apply down through the ages.

Well, the general approach of recognizing the values that inform the interpretation of the Constitution, it applies to modern times. But just to take the example that you gave of the Equal Protection Clause. The Framers choose broad terms of broad applicability, and they state a broad principle, and the fact that it may have been inconsistent with their practice may have meant that they were adopting a broad principle that was inconsistent with their practice, and their practices would have to change, as they did, with respect to segregation in the Senate galleries, with respect to segregation in other areas.But when they adopt broad terms and broad principles, we should hold them to their word, and imply them consistent with those terms and those principles. And that means when they have adopted principles like liberty, that doesn’t get a crabbed or narrowconstruction. It is a broad principle that should be applied consistent with their intent, which was to adopt a broad principle.I depart from some views of original intent in the sense that those folks, some people view it as meaning just the conditions at that time, just the particular problem. I think you need to look at the words they used, and if the words adopt a broader principle, it applies more broadly.

Well, that does get into an area where cases are coming up. The Chief in that position was referencing of course the holding in Roe v. Wade, and that was what the issue was in Casey. But I don’t think I should opine on the correctness or incorrectness of particular views in areas that are likely to come before the Court.

I don’t think it’s appropriate— 

No, no. [Laughter.] 

Well, I don’t think the Court should be the task master of Congress. I think the Constitution is the Court’s task master, and it’s Congress’s task master as well. And we each haveresponsibilities under the Constitution. And I appreciate very much the differences in institutional competence between the judiciary and the Congress when it comes to basic questions of fact finding, development of a record, and also the authority to make the policy decisions about how to act on the basis of a particular record. It’s not just disagreement over a record. It’s a question of whose job it is to make a determination based on the record. Now—

Well, Mr. Chairman, I don’t want to comment on the correctness of incorrectness of a particular decision. What I will say—

Well, Mr. Chairman, I must respectfully disagree. I have been willing to comment on cases that I think are not likely to come before the Court again. I think the particular question you ask about the adequacy of findings, make a determination of the impact on interstate commerce, is likely to come before the Court again. And expressing an opinion on whether the Morrison case was correct or incorrect would be prejudging those cases that are likely to come before the Court again. And that is the line— it’s not just a line that I’m drawing. It’s a line that, as I’ve read the transcripts, every nominee who’s sitting on the Court today drew. Some of them drew the line far more aggressively and wouldn’t even comment on cases like Marbury v. Madison.What I can tell you is that with respect to review of congressional findings, that my view of the appropriate role of a judge is a limited role and that you do not make the law, and that it seems to me that one of the warning flags that should suggest to you as a judge that you may be beginning to transgress into the area of making a law is when you are in a position of re-evaluating legislative findings, because that doesn’t look like a judicial function. It’s not an application of analysis under the Constitution. It’s just another look at findings.Now, again, I don’t feel it’s appropriate to comment on Morrison. I do feel it’s appropriate to tell you that I appreciate the differences between Congress and the courts with respect to findings, bothwith respect to the issue of the capability and competence to undertake that enterprise, and also with respect to the issue of authority to make a decision based on the findings.

Well, these questions arise, of course, under, as you know, section 5 of the 14th Amendment, where the issue is Congress’s power to address violations of the 14th Amendment. And it’s an extraordinary grant of power, and the Court has always recognized it as such. And their decisions in recent years—it’s not just, as you point out, the Garrett case on the one hand and the Lane case on the other. You have the Hibbs case recently, which upheld Congress’s exercise of authority. The most recent cases— Lane and Hibbs—uphold Congress’s exercise of authority to abrogate—

Well, and that was Justice Scalia’s position in dissent. He had originally—

Well, again, the congruent and proportional test—

I don’t think it’s appropriate in an area—and there are cases coming up, as you know, Mr. Chairman. There’s a case on the docket right now that considers the congruence and proportionality test. 

Well, and if I am confirmed and I do have to sit on that case, I would approach that with an open mind and consider the arguments. I can’t give you a commitment here today about how I will approach an issue that is going to be on the docket within a matter of months. 

Well, I don’t want to be presumptuous about if I am confirmed, what I would do. I do think, though, it’s a responsibility of all of the Justices, not just the Chief Justice, to try to work toward an opinion of the Court. The Supreme Court speaks only as a Court. Individually, the Justices have no authority. And I do think it should be a priority to have an opinion of the Court. You don’t obviously compromise strongly held views, but you do have to be open to the considered views of your colleagues, particularly when it gets to a concurring opinion. I do think you do need to ask yourself, what benefit is this serving? Why is it necessary for me to state this separate reason? Can I go take another look at what the four of them think or the three of them think to see if I can subscribe to that or get them to modify it in a way that would allow me to subscribe to that, because an important function of the Supreme Court is to provide guidance. As a lower court judge, I appreciate clear guidance from the Supreme Court. I know the last thing Chief Justice Rehnquist said in Court, on the last day of the term he was reading the disposition in a case and said, you know, A reaches this conclusion, is joined by B, and then C has a separate concurrence joined by D and E, and he ended up by saying, ‘‘I didn’t know we had that many Judges on the Court.’’ That undermines the importance of providing guidance. I do think the Chief Justice has a particular obligation to try to achieve consensus consistent with everyone’s individual oath to uphold the Constitution, and that would certainly be a priority for me if I were confirmed. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Senator, I haven’t dealt with a lot of First Amendment access cases. I know I studied one about media access to prisons, for example, the issue about whether the media had a right of access to prisons if they wanted to report on it. So I am not terribly familiar with the precise levels of scrutiny that apply.There is, obviously, a balancing of sorts between particular interests when you are dealing with governmental operations and there are some perfectly valid reasons for excluding media. On the other hand, simply disagreement about whether it’s an appropriate issue for the public to see would not strike me as a very compelling governmental interest, and I think the courts regularly balance these sorts of things when they get an issue about a challenge by the media saying their First Amendment rights are being violated because of a particular exclusion.Again, I’m not terribly familiar with the precise legal standards or how they’ve developed since the prison access case that I’m familiar with, but it does require a consideration and weighing, and the values of the First Amendment obviously are something that have to be given careful weight by the court for the very reasons that you have discussed, because the First Amendment is—it serves a purpose. It’s not there just because the Framers thought this was in general a good idea. It serves a purpose with respect to the government. It provides access to information and allowspeople in a free society to make a judgment about what their government is up to.

Well, I think as a general— 

Well, you know, I do start with a general principle in this area, and I think it was Justice Brandeis who talked about sunlight being the best disinfectant— 

Well, Senator, and this is the basis of the disagreement in Herrera. Herrera was not a case about actual inno-cence. It’s a question of whether you’re entitled to bring a new claim—

Well, prove his innocence. The issue arrives before you get to the question of proof and the question is, do you allow someone who has raised several claims over the years to suddenly say at the last minute, somebody who just died was the person who committed the murder, and does that mean you start the trial all over again simply on the basis of that last-minute claim, or do you require more of a showing at that stage? That’s what Herrera was about.Now, I don’t think, of course, that anybody who is innocent should be—suffer as a result of a false conviction. If they’ve been falsely convicted and they’re innocent, they shouldn’t be—

I would think not, but the question is never do you allow the execution of an innocent person. The question is, do you allow particular claimants to raise different claims a fourth or fifth or sixth time, to say at the last minute, somebody who just died was actually the person who committed the murder. Let’s have a new trial. Or do you take into account the proceedings that have already gone on. 

Well, that’s what the Court held in Herrera— 

Well, I’m not in a position to comment on the correctness or incorrectness of particular Court decisions. That’s the Court’s precedent in Herrera. It agreed with the administration position, which was not that innocent people should be subject to imprisonment or execution— 

No, because the position was stated in a brief filed on behalf of the administration and we talked yesterday about the established principle that lawyers do not subscribe as a personal matter to the views they present on behalf of clients. 

Well, I was the Deputy Solicitor General on the brief. I didn’t argue the case. The Solicitor General was the counselof record in the case. But the position presented in the brief as an advocate is not necessarily the position of every lawyer on the brief.

He who acts for another acts for himself? Well, it’s the client acting through the lawyer. And it’s the client who’s acting for themselves.

No, Senator, I disagree with that. 

The Solicitor General represents the interests of the United States, and those positions represent that client’s position. In the Herrera case, again, it was the Solicitor General who was responsible for the position that was advanced. I’m not suggesting in any way that I disagree with it or agree with it. I’m just saying that it is a basic principle in our system that lawyers represent clients, and you do not ascribe the position of the client to the lawyer. It’s a position that goes back to John Adams and the Revolution. 

It’s an issue that I’m familiar with. I do know it arose. And I thought the common practice, the current practice was that if there are four votes to grant cert that the Court would grant the stay, even though that does require the fifth vote, so that you don’t have a situation— 

Right. 

I think that practice makes a lot of sense. I don’t want to commit to pursue a particular practice in an area that I’llobviously have to look at in the future, but it obviously makes great sense that if you have four to grant and that’s the rule that you will consider an issue if there are four to grant. You don’t want to moot the case by not staying the sentence.

No, Senator. 

Well, in 1983, of course, they were hearing about 150 cases a year. They hear about half that now. Again, I don’t want to prejudge questions or even be presumptuous to look down the road, but it seems to me that there’s the capability there to hear more cases today, not fewer. And I’m sure there are reasons for the reduction in the caseload that I’m not familiar with that I might become more familiar with, but they handled twice as many cases 20 years ago than they do today. And I think the capability to address more issues is there in the Court. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Yes, Senator, I will. I certainly am not qualified to comment on the best approaches in the war on terror or the most effective approaches. That is the responsibility, obviously, of the other branches. The responsibility of the judicial branch is to decide particular cases that are presented to them in this area according to the rule of law, and that is what I have tried to do, and that is what I will continue to do, either on the court of appeals or another court.

Well, I can give the commitment that I appreciate that my role as a judge is different than my role as a staff lawyer for an administration. As a judge, I have no agenda. I have a guide in the Constitution and the laws and the precedents of theCourt, and those are what I would apply with an open mind, after fully and fairly considering the arguments and assessing the considered views of my colleagues on the bench. That’s the way I would approach cases in that area, as in any other area.The approach of someone who is obviously a staff lawyer in an administration is very different. The approach of someone who is an advocate for a client before the Court is obviously very different. Those are positions that I have held in the past. I am now a judge, and I have had the experience and I think my record will establish that that is how I approach cases across the spectrum of issues that are raised before the courts.

Oh, certainly. 

The administration’s position prevailed before the Court. 

Yes, which, of course, is always the prerogative of Congress when you’re dealing with a question of statutory interpretation, and that’s part of a regular interchange between the Court and the Congress. Sometimes if the Court gets something wrong, Congress can fix it. Even if the Court gets it right but Congress thinks the approach ought to be changed, Congress is free to legislate for a different result. 

That’s correct, Senator. 

Yes, Senator. 

Well, yes, Senator. The debate as you remember was over whether or not Section 2 should be extended without change as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Mobile v. Bolden, or whether it should be changed to incorporate the effects test and later the totality of the circumstances test. The administration position at the time was to extend the Voting Rights Act for the longest period in history without change, and that was the position that I was working on at the time, and Congress eventually decided, with—Senator Dole and some of the other Senators developed a compromise position on Section 2, and that was enacted with the support of the administration. The one thing that was clear to me throughout those extended debates was that the people on both sides of the issue, in good faith, supported extension of the Voting Rights Act, and recognized the importance of the Voting Rights Act in securing civil liberties for all Americans. It wasn’t a dispute about the goal. It wasn’t a dispute about the objective. It wasn’t a dispute about the importance. It was a dispute about whether to extend the Act without change or whether to make changes in the Act, and that was what the debate was about. 

Good morning, Senator. 

I am remembering it from when we addressed this debate 23 years ago, yes. 

That was the administration position. 

I certainly remember the provision in the House bill at the time.

Well, I was still working for the administration, Senator. President Reagan’s position was to extend the Act without change. As you mentioned, that was the Attorney General’s position. I was a Special Assistant to the Attorney General, and I was doing my best to implement their views and support their views.

Well, with respect, Senator, my understanding— and I looked at that memorandum recently—is that the issue was whether or not to circulate something explaining the administration position, and I didn’t think Mr. Reynolds’s view was, you shouldn’t do that because you didn’t support the position. It was a question whether or not to circulate something at that time.And my view was whether or not—I thought if the administration was advocating its position, it ought to get the position out.

Well, Senator, I don’t know what the analysis— you read a clause of a sentence and I would have to look at the whole memorandum to see exactly what the suggestion or the issue was in that case.

Certainly. 

What we’re referring to—what I’m referring to in this paragraph is the Court’s determination, if I’m looking at this correctly, under Section 5, its determination—the language you read notes the Supreme Court’s conclusion under Section 5, which is the pre-clearance provision that applies to jurisdictions with a history of discrimination, and what the Court had said in that case was that requirement of pre-clearance was acceptable given the record that the Congress had established in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 of the practices in those jurisdictions. And the concern was that if you extend the effects test nationwide, that the record which had been established only with respect to particular jurisdictions in the South wouldn’t apply nationwide, and that would be the basis for a constitutional challenge. The application of the test under Section 2, which is, as you know, if we use the shorthand effects test, it’s actually the totality of the circumstances test and it lays forth a number of considerations. I think there is some argument about how it closely attracts the effects test under Section 5 or if it’s a different totality of the circumstances approach. I’m not aware of any case that has questioned the constitutionality of the application of the totality of the circumstances case under Section 2 and if an issue on that were to be presented to me on the Supreme Court, which it may be, given the pending extension of the Voting Rights Act, I would, of course, confront that issue as a judge and not as a staff attorney for an administration with a position, and as a judge, I would come to the issue with an open mind and I would fully and fairly consider any arguments that might be presented. I don’t know if an argument is going to be presented about the application of the totality of the circumstances test nationwide. Again, I’m not aware of any challenges that have been presented to it since it was enacted. I don’t know if any will be if or when the Voting Rights Act is extended again, but if it is, I would confront that as a judge and not as a staff attorney for an administration with a particular position on that issue. 

I have no basis. I am not aware of any constitutional challenge that has been brought to Section 2 since it was enacted. I’ve not—I have no basis for viewing it as constitutionally suspect and I don’t. If an issue were to arise before the Supreme Court or before the Court of Appeals, if I head back there, I would consider that issue with an open mind in light of the arguments. I’ve got no basis for viewing it as constitutionally suspect today and I’m not aware that it’s been challenged in that respect since it was enacted. It may have been, but as I say, I’m not aware of it.

Yes. 

Certainly. 

Well, the weight it was given was to help satisfy the test, because the Court, as you know, in Grutter applied strict scrutiny because it was dealing with considerations on the basis of race and that required a showing of a compelling governmental interest to support that legislative action. The testimony of the military officers, as the Court explained, helped substantiate the compelling nature of the interest in having a diverse United student body. That was the weight that the Court gave it. There was, of course, the other case. There were two Michigan cases, the law school case and the university case, the Gratz case, where the Court did say that it looked too much like a quota inthat case because it was given determinative consideration as opposed to being one of a variety of factors that is considered.The two cases together kind of show where the Court is coming out, at least in the area of higher education. The Court permits consideration of race or ethnic background so long as it is not sort of a make-or-break test.

Well, Senator, I think I can answer the specific questions you asked because as you phrased the question, do you agree with her that it’s important to look at the real-world significance and impact, and I can certainly say that I do think that that is the appropriate approach without commenting on the outcome or the judgment in a particular case, that you do need to look at the real-world impact in this area, and I think in other areas, as well.

Well, I certainly agree that every citizen who meets the qualifications not only has the right to vote but should vote. I think it’s a problem that we don’t have more people voting. And any issues that come before me under the Voting Rights Act, I will confront those with an open mind and decide them after full and fair consideration of the arguments, in light of the precedents of the Court, and in light of a recognition of the critical role that the right to vote plays as preservative of all other rights. 

Sure. Well, if I leave one out, you can remind me at the end. But obviously when you are dealing with interpreting a statute, the most important part is the text. You begin with the text, and as the Supreme Court has said, in many cases, perhaps most cases, that’s also where you end. The answer is clear.I have, though, as a judge, relied on legislative history to help clarify ambiguity in the text. The Supreme Court stated once—and I think it’s a very important principle—you look to legislative history to clarify ambiguity. You don’t look to legislative history to create ambiguity. In other words, if the text is clear, that is what you follow, and that’s binding. And you don’t look beyond it to say, well, if you look here, though, maybe this clear word should be interpreted a different way.On the other hand, we confront situations where the text is not clear, and the legislative history can be helpful in resolving that ambiguity. It requires a certain sensitivity to what you’re dealing with. All legislative history is not created equal. There’s a difference between the weight that you give a conference report and the weight you give a statement of one legislator on the floor. You have to, I think, have some degree of sensitivity in understanding exactly what you’re looking at, appreciate where those comments were made in the legislative process, be careful to make sure that they’re dealing with the same language that was eventually adopted. You have to, for example, be very skeptical about statements by opponents of the bill. It’s quite a common thing saying, well, this bill would do this, this, and this, and so we shouldn’t pass it. That’s not always the best guide as to what the sponsors really intended in the language. So it does require a certain sensitivity to what you’re dealing with.But I have quoted and looked to legislative history in the past to help determine the meaning of ambiguous terms, and I would expect to follow that same approach on the Supreme Court. I don’t think there’s a difference there in terms of what things you think it is appropriate to look to, to help you do your job, which is to figure out what Congress intended.

In some instances, I think if you look at it carefully, you can make an assessment that this is a reliable guide. And one area I didn’t touch on in my arguments, I’ve certainly relied on legislative history in presenting arguments because, of course, in the Supreme Court you need five votes and not just the one. So you tend to cast your net as widely as possible. And at argument sometimes, Justice Scalia would not be as receptive to an argument based on legislative history as some of the others, but, again, the name of the game is counting to five when you’re arguing up there. And so I’ve certainly made arguments based on legislative history.

Well, Senator, the answer to your question is it’s certainly possible that the majority in that case didn’t get it right and that the dissent that was a very strong dissent did get it right.I think the majority got it right. There we focused on particular language. The issue in the case involved, as you know, a subcontractor claim. You have the United States giving money to—in this case, it was Amtrak, and then Amtrak using that money to hire a subcontractor—I think it was Bombardier—to do a particular part of the job. Everybody agreed that under the precedents that are applied, Amtrak is not the Government, can’t be considered part of the Government. And the statute, as you noted, required—it was triggered by the presentment of a false claim to an officer or employee of the United States. And the majority’s reasoning was that when—the false claim was one made by Bombardier to Amtrak, and the claim was submitted to Amtrak. And since Amtrak was not the Government, what Judge Rogers and I concluded was that that wasn’t presentment of a false claim to an officer or employee of the United States.There was an extensive discussion between the majority and the dissent. The view that you have articulated was certainly presented in a compelling way by Judge Garland, my colleague on the court of appeals, and we spent a great deal of time on the case, and I think it’s reflected in the opinions. And that view was laid out. Judge Rogers and I thought that the statutory language that said the claim had to be presented to an officer or employee presented too high a hurdle for us to get over in looking at the legislative history.But I’m happy to concede that it was among the more difficult cases I’ve had over the past 2 years. Anytime Judge Garland disagrees, you know you’re in a difficult area. And the function of his dissent to make us focus on what we were deciding and to make sure that we felt we were doing the right thing I think was well served. But Judge Garland disagreed, and so it’s obviously to me a case on which reasonable judges can disagree. And I just have to rest on the analysis in the majority opinion.

Well, not on that one. I do know the Bush administration filed an amicus brief in our case as well. I guess this would be one of those cases I would cite in response to the question of whether I’m capable of ruling against the administration. We did in that case. Again, the arguments, I think, were well presented on both sides, and Judge Rogers and I gave it our best shot, and the opinion will stand or fall on its own.

Well, you’ve touched on a case that’s very close to my heart, Senator. It was the first case I argued before the Supreme Court. I was appointed by the Court to argue it on behalf of Mr. Halper.It was an unusual case. It arose—the conspiracy at issue was a slight inflation of—I believe it was Medicare or Medicaid claims that this individual was submitting. I think he added $1 or $2 to every claim. And yet under the law at that time, there was a minimum penalty for each false claim. These numbers won’t be right, but he had something like 300 false claims for a grand total of maybe $700, but under the statute, he was assessed a civil penalty of several million dollars because each of the false claims was a separate penalty.And the issue was, after having been sentenced criminally, would a civil penalty of several—and, again, I’m not sure of the numbers, but several million dollars for $700 or so of fraud, was that remedial and civil or was it punishment? And the Court agreed with my submission at the time that that was punishment. It led to some difficulty, I think, in administering civil and criminal laws down the line, and as you said, 8 years later they reversed course and overruled the Halper precedent.But the provision that you specifically mentioned, treble damages, that is a little different. There it’s a much closer connection, obviously just 3 times whatever the damages are. In the Halper case, it was a much more disproportionate impact, and that’s what led the Court, I think, to conclude that that looks like punishment. Treble damages is something that’s familiar in the law in a number of areas and is not regarded as impermissible punishment in this context.

I think, if my memory serves, that the Article III objections, and just so we’re on the same page, the qui tam statutes, of course, are when a private individual brings suit on behalf of the government for fraud on the government and in return gets a percentage of the recovery. And as you noted, it’s been under the False Claims Act very successful in securing recovery of funds on behalf of the government.The Vermont case—and I’m not remembering it any more than that, it was a case from Vermont—I think addressed most of the Article III issues. The objection was that individual has no standing, I think, because he doesn’t necessarily have an interest, and what the Court said was that the individual has standing as a result of the bounty, if you will, the percentage he gets. That satisfies the standing requirement, so those objections are out of the way.I do know that some have raised additional objections under Article II, which goes to the fact that this might interfere with the Executive’s authority to execute the law. In other words, you have private individuals bringing suit. I’m not sure that those issues have been finally resolved, and obviously, if those cases do come up, I’ll want to keep an open mind.The fact that you mentioned, obviously, about historic practice, that is something that the Court does look to in assessing constitutionality. If it’s something that the Founders were familiar with or a practice that they engaged in and showed no disagreement with, that, while not determinative, that is a factor that the Court would look at. I don’t know if any of those cases are going to come before the Court, but if they do, it’s one of the considerations that’ll have to be taken into account.

I don’t remember any, no, Senator. 

I don’t recall any role, Senator. Our office—the Counsel’s office would routinely review testimony that was about to be given. We were just looking out for particular constitutional concerns or issues. We generally did not get into the substance. The substance of that would have been shaped over in the Justice Department and we would have really been looking out for anything that we thought infringed on the constitutional authorities of the President or presented other consistency issues. But the substance of the testimony is not something I was involved in. 

No, Senator. I have had some whistleblower cases, different aspects I do recall coming up in the Court of Ap-peals and I think in some cases, we ruled in favor and in some cases, we ruled against. So I have seen those cases and had no difficulty fairly and objectively deciding them.

Well, you know, my new best friend, Senator Thompson, assures me that television cameras are nothing to be afraid of—[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS.—but I don’t have a set view on that. I do think it’s something that I would have to—I would want to listen to the views of, if I were confirmed, to my colleagues— 

Good morning, Senator. Fine, thanks. 

I am used to being interrupted before the court, that is for sure, Senator. [Laughter.] 

I’ll try, Senator. 

Yes. 

Well, Senator, first of all— 

Well, I can say that it is my view that all of the Justices—I think if a case like the Glucksberg case in which a majority subscribe to the view, there is an appropriate mode of analysis to determine the content of the Liberty Clause and it does include protection beyond physical restraint and that that protection applies in a substantive manner. Now, there are legal theorists, there are judges and jurists who do not agree with that, who do not agree that there is a right of privacy protected under the Due Process Clause, who do not agree that the liberty protected extends beyond freedom from physical restraint. Their view is that it means you cannot be basically imprisoned or arrested without due process and that means only that you get some type of procedural protection.That is not my understanding of where the Justices on the Supreme Court are and it’s not my understanding. I believe that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause is not limited to freedom from physical restraint, that it includes certain other protections, including the right to privacy. As you know, the Court has tried to map out in a series of cases that go back to Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce and all that and in various instances as the claims have arisen, and that it’s protected not simply from procedural depravation. That is—

Well, and— 

Well, Senator, that does get into an area that is coming before the Court. There is a case pending on the docket right now that raises the question of whether or not State legislatures have a prerogative to lay down rules on certain end-of-life issues— 

Well, in that case, it’s the application of the Federal Controlled Substance law. 

The issue of illness in those cases do come before the Court. The Glucksberg case raised a similar question. The Cruzan case that you mentioned, presented it in a very difficult context of an incompetent individual, no longer able to make a decision, and the question of how the State law should apply in that situation. Those cases do come before the Court. 

No, I’m not going to consider issues like that in the context as a father or a husband or anything else.

I think— 

I think, obviously, putting aside any of those considerations, these issues are the most difficult we face as people, and they are profoundly affected by views of individuality and moral views, and deeply personal views. That’s obviously true as a general matter. But at the same time, the position of a judge is not to incorporate his or her personal views in deciding issues of this sort. If you’re interpreting a particular statute that governs in this area, your job as a judge is to interpret and apply that according to the rule of law. If you’re addressing claims of a fundamental right under the liberty, protected by the Due Process Clause, again, the view of a judge on a personal matter or a personal level is not the guide to the decision, and— 

Well, Senator, I can’t answer that question in the abstract because— 

Well, Senator, as a legal matter it is abstract because the question would be in any particular case, is there a law that applies that governs that decision? What does the law apply— 

Well, no. 

Well, Senator, what I’m telling you is, as you know, there are cases that come up in exactly that context so that it is in play, and the sense is that there are cases involving disputes between people asserting their rights to terminate life, to remove feeding tubes either on their own behalf or on behalf of others. There is legislation that States have passed in this area that governs that, and there are claims that are raised that the legislation is unconstitutional. Those are issues that come before the Court, and as a result, I will confront those issues in light of the Court’s precedents, with an open mind. I will not take to the Court whatever personal views I have on the issues, and I appreciate the sensitivity involved. They won’t be based on my personal views. They’ll be based on my understanding of the law. 

Senator, that’s asking me for a opinion in the abstract on a question that will come before the Court. And when that question does come before the Court, the litigants before me are entitled to have a Justice deciding their case with an open mind, based on the arguments presented, based on the precedents presented. I have told you with respect how I would go about deciding that case. It begins with the recognition that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause does extend to matters of privacy, that it is not limited to restraints on physical freedom, and that that protection is protected—it extends in a substantive way, and not simply procedurally.I have also explained the sources that judges look to in determining the content of that privacy protected by the Liberty Clause. They’re the ones that have been spelled out in the Court’s opinion, the Nation’s history, traditions and practices.And I have explained how judges apply that history, tradition and practices in light of the limited role of a judge to interpret the law and not make the law. The limited role of the judge in light of the prerogatives of the legislature.

Senator, could I— 

I mean, I think you’re quite right that that is quite often the critical question in these cases, the degree of generality at which you define what the tradition, the history, and the practice you’re looking at. The example, I think, that I’ve always found it easiest to grasp was Loving v. Virginia. Do you look at the history of miscegenation statutes, or do you look at the history of marriage? 

Well, I get extra time, you said. 

Thank you. The point is that, again, the Court has precedents on precisely that question, about how you should phrase the level of generality. And you look at— 

Well, you do not look at the level of generality that is the issue that’s being challenged. So, for example, in Loving v. Virginia, if the challenge is, it seems to me—and this is what the Court’s precedents say. If the challenge is to miscegenation statutes, that’s not the level of generality because you’re going to answer it’s completely circular. 

Well, that’s what I’m saying. The dispute is do you look at it at that level of specificity or broader. And I’m saying you do not look at the narrowest level of generality, which is the statute that’s being challenged, because obviously that’s completely circular. You are saying there is obviously that statute that’s part of the history. So you look at it at a broader level of generality. Now, the only point I was going to make earlier—because I do think it is an important one. You make the point that we stand for election and we wouldn’t be elected if we didn’t tell people what we stand for. Judges don’t stand for election. I’m not standing for election, and it is contrary to the role of judges in our society to say that this judge should go on the bench because these are his or her positions and those are the positions they’re going to apply. Judges go on the bench and they apply and decide cases according to the judicial process, not on the basis of promises made earlier to get elected or promises made earlier to get confirmed. That’s inconsistent with the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court. 

Thank you, Senator. 

I think that’s a concern that other nominees have raised in the past, particularly given the expression of views as part of the confirmation process. It’s not supposed to be a bargaining process, and if you start stating views with respect to particular issues of concern to one Senator, then obviously everyone is going to have their list. And when that individual nominee, if con-firmed, if the bargain is successful from his or her point of view and he gets confirmed, he will have to begin each case not with the parties’ briefs and arguments but with the transcript of the confirmation hearing to see what he or she swore to under oath was their view in a particular area of the law or a particular case. And I think that would undermine the independence of the Supreme Court. It would undermine the integrity of the judicial process. Every one of the Justices on the Court today, every one of them refused to engage in that type of process. And if I am to sit with them, if I am confirmed, I feel I have to follow the same approach.Now, I do think I have been more expansive than most nominees. I have gone back and read the transcripts, and some of them would not talk about particular cases even if it were unlikely that the case was going to come before the Court. And the reason they gave was, look, it is hard to draw the line. If I think this case is not going to come before the Court, what about this one? And maybe that will. And rather than trying to draw the line, I am just not going to do it. And those Justices were confirmed.I have taken what I think is a more pragmatic approach. If I think an issue is not likely to come before the Court, I have told the Committee what my views on that case were, what my views on that case are. You know, perhaps that means I am in— it is sometimes difficult to draw the line. Perhaps that’s right. But, again, if I make the judgment—and other nominees may draw the line differently, may have drawn it differently in the past or differently in the future, the nominee I think has to be comfortable with the proposition that they’re not doing anything that’s going to undermine the integrity of the Court. 

That’s right. There wasn’t—I don’t know if they had as much access to that type of evidence back then when it was argued, but it was certainly not that type of evidence. It was a new claim that somebody else did it, somebody who had just died. That was the new claim that they sought to raise at the last stage there. And I do think any issue arising with respect to DNA evidence— and those issues are working their way up through the Court. Those cases would have to be addressed on their own terms.

Senator. 

I appreciate the question, Senator. It is an area where I will happily concede that the Justices are not acting just like umpires in deciding which cases they’re going to hear as opposed to how they’re going to decide them. My perspective has changed a little bit in this area. Certainly when I was practicing law, a lot of what I spent my time trying to do was get the Supreme Court to take a case. As you know, you file these things called petitions for certiorari, which are really quite extensive arguments about why the Court should hear your case, having really not that much to do with the merits, whether it was right or wrong, but just why the Court needs to issue an opinion in this area. And I thought they weren’t taking enough cases. When I became a court of appeals judge, I thought you didn’t need to have more cases taken up for review.But the considerations, some are pretty well established. The job of the Supreme Court is to ensure the uniformity and consistency of Federal law, in particular, interpretations of the Constitution. So the clearest case that the Court should hear, they should grant certiorari on, as they say, is when two different courts of appeals are interpreting a law differently. Obviously, the law should mean the same thing in every part of the country, and if two different courts take a different view of the law, that’s the kind of case the Court ought to be taking.I think the Court should, as a general matter—and, again, other Justices have expressed this view as well—grant review in cases in which a lower court strikes down an Act of Congress. I don’t think that’s an absolute rule, but certainly as a general matter, if an Act of Congress is going to be declared unconstitutional, I think the Supreme Court ought to be the one determining that as a final matter, and generally not leave it to a court of appeals.So those are two categories: when there is a conflict, when an Act is found to be unconstitutional.Beyond that—and this is where I agree with you the umpire analogy does not hold up—there is a lot of discretion in deciding whether it is the right time to grant review in a case. The people who practice before the Court talk about the Court letting an issue percolate a little bit, in other words, get more than just one or twodecisions from the courts of appeals, wait until others have had a chance to weigh in. The theory is that makes it more likely the Supreme Court will get it right if they have the benefit of several decisions from the lower courts rather than just one. Other cases the Justices determine that that’s not appropriate. It’s not appropriate to wait until the issue develops a little more; they want to look at it expeditiously. And it’s hard to lay down categorical rules in that area.I have expressed the view—and it may be a view that I’ll have to be educated on further if I am confirmed, and I am not stating it as a solid view. I do think there is room for the Court to take more cases. They hear about half the number of cases they did 25 years ago. There may be good reasons for that that I will learn if I am confirmed, but just looking at it from the outside, I think they could contribute more to the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking more cases.I have heard others say they could contribute to the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking fewer cases, but I don’t subscribe to that view. I think there is room for additional cases on the docket.

That’s right. The decision of the court of appeals stands in that case. Now, it is true that I think the Justices generally look at their duty and obligation to ensure consistency in a fairly dispassionate and objective way. In other words, it doesn’t matter how a particular case came out. If it’s different in one part of the country than another, most of the Justices in my experience readily agree that that’s the kind of case they need to address.

You mentioned first the Youngstown case, and it is a category—and I think perhaps the Bush v. Gore case, that perhaps the Justices concluded it fell into that category. There are certain cases—they don’t come along all that often—that are, by their importance, significant enough for the Court to take. In other words, they don’t fit the description of a conflict among the Courts of Appeals or an Act of Congress held unconstitutional, but they are otherwise sufficiently important that the Court will grant review and take those cases.Certainly, the Youngstown case was of that sort. It started out actually in the D.C. Court, the hearing was first there, and then the Court granted that. But the decision by a President to seize the steel mills based on—constitutionally, that’s an important enough issue you want the Supreme Court to issue a final ruling on that.On the decision in Bush v. Gore and the determination of whether to grant review in that case, again, that’s not something that— you don’t know on what basis the Justices make a decision to grant review. You just get an order that says ‘‘review is granted.’’ In that case you had a decision of a State court that apparently the Justices thought should be reviewed, and obviously, expeditious treatment was needed, as I think it was in the Youngstown case as well. They’re capable of moving expeditiously when an important matter requires them to do so.

Well, that’s an area where I have not been—I have not felt free to comment, whether or not I agree with particular decisions or—

I do think that the issue about the propriety of Supreme Court review in matters of disputed electoral contests is a matter that could come up again. Obviously, the particular parameters in that case won’t, but it is a very recent precedent, and that type of decision is one where I thought it inappropriate to comment on whether I think they were correct or not. 

Senator, I don’t think it’s appropriate for me as a nominee to comment on the Senate’s treatment of other nominees, and I would respectfully decline to do that. 

Well, I did tell you that was my initial reaction. I remember hearing about the decision driving actually back from a Judicial Conference with another judge, and we all learn in law school, one of the first cases you study is called Calder v. Bull, has a basic proposition the Government cannot take property from A and give it to B. When I read the decision, I understood what the majority’s position was, the difficulty of drawing a line between things that are obviously public use like a railroad, a road, things that are traditionally the subject of the exercise of eminent domain, and other activities that are not as clearly within that range of course.Justice O’Connor, in her dissent, thought that a line could be drawn between whether it was available to the public or not, and that certainly was available. The majority did say that it was not ruling on the starkest example, in other words, just determining to take the property from A to B because you think B could make better use of it. The issue arose, as you noted in your question, in the context of an urban renewal redevelopment project, and that may be limited to that context or may not.I do know there’s been extensive legislative reaction to the decision. I know a number of States have passed laws already, saying, ‘‘We do not authorize the use of the power of eminent domain to take—for a use that’s going to be from one private owner to another,’’ and that’s certainly an appropriate reaction to the Court’s decision in this area.What the Court is saying, what the majority is saying is because of the difficulty of drawing a line, this issue is really left up to the legislature, and if the legislature wants to draw the line in a particular place, it has that authority. But it certainly is a decision that was closely divided, 5–4, and it has gotten a lot of legislative reaction.The point I would only make is that it’s perhaps a good example of the fact that legislatures, legislators have a responsibility to protect the rights of the people just as much as courts, and one way they can protect the rights of the people in this area, if they think it appropriate, is to restrict themselves in saying, ‘‘We will not use the eminent domain power to the broadest extent that the Supreme Court has said we are authorized to do.’’

No. Again, that’s—particularly since it’s an area they do specifically leave open the question about whether it applies outside of a redevelopment project. That’s an issue that could come before the Court. It’s not one I feel appropriate to comment on.

It’s certainly one of those areas that could come before the Court again, even in its present form. I know the author of the majority opinion has said it was an area where he, as a personal policy matter, wouldn’t have exercised that authority, but, ofcourse, the issue there was the legal issue, not policy preferences. It could come before the Court again, yes.

That would be one of the decisions that in the exercise of the cert process, as they call it, short for the certiorari decision, and that would certainly be an issue that could come before the Court, and they already have, of course, four dissenters who may be anxious to revisit it or not. I don’t know. I don’t want to presume how they would view it on an ongoing basis.

Yes, I do, Senator. In fact, when I was in private practice, one of the cases I handled was the Microsoft antitrust case on behalf of government officials, the States in particular. A number of States retained me to argue that case before the D.C. Circuit en banc. So I certainly appreciate the role of governments, both State and Federal, in enforcing the protections of the antitrust laws, because as you know, there is concurrent authority in that area, the Sherman Act, of course, on the Federal level and then what people call the ‘‘Baby Sherman Acts’’ on the State level.

Well, I think it depends on what area you’re talking about. I do think that the system established under the Sherman Act of private antitrust enforcement, and, of course, the opportunity to recover additional damages and attorneys’ fees and other aspects, has been an effective tool in enforcing the law. There are areas, as you mentioned. If the issue is mostly consumer rights as opposed to business rivals, government action may be more necessary in those areas as opposed to the others.And I know that government antitrust regulators make those determinations every day, that their resources are best directed to areas where consumers or attorneys bringing class actions on consumers’ behalf, whatever the reasons were, the incentive system for private litigation may not be as effective, and that’s often the areawhere State Attorneys General, the Justice Department, decide to get involved to supplement the private enforcement activity.

Well, I am familiar with how the Judicial Conference operates for at least part of its role. I’ve been on the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules. I was there as a lawyer and I kept on as a judge. In fact, I was slated to be the Chairman of that Committee starting in October.So I understand the role in promoting the forum of rules that apply in the Federal courts, both the appellate rules, the civil rules, criminal rules, and bankruptcy rules, and evidence rules, different committees there, and I’m familiar with the process. They go through the Advisory Committee, a broader Committee about rules in general. Then they’re submitted to the Judicial Conference for consideration, and it’s a very exhaustive process, but I think also a very responsive one. Particular problems are identified in practice by practitioners, by judges. They’re submitted to the committees. They review them. They come up with proposals. It’s a very important part of the functioning of the Federal system and it affects all the levels, not just the Supreme Court, of course, but courts of appeals and the trial courts.Other issues of concern, obviously pressing issues, concerns with respect to security in light of different developments. Those are addressed at the Judicial Conference. Any need for legislative action that the courts feel is appropriate.I have to tell you that if I were to be confirmed, as an initial matter, I think my primary posture is going to be one of listening because there’s obviously much I have to learn about matters of concern to different judges, different courts around the country, and that’s the good thing about the Judicial Conference, of course. They bring in judges from around the country to make sure that you get a national perspective on what needs to be done and you’re not just focused on issues here in Washington or anywhere else.But it’s an area where I think I will have to listen a lot at the outset before being presumptuous enough to have a particular agenda.

Thank you, Senator. 

Good afternoon.

Well, Senator, your question really brings—ties together a few things we’ve already touched on.I don’t remember if it was you or someone else who referenced Justice White’s description of his obligation, what it was, and his answer was, ‘‘To decide cases.’’—

And the basis for the institution of judicial review, as explained by Chief Justice John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison is similarly grounded on the obligation to decide cases and controversies, because if you look at the Constitution it doesn’t say in Article III that the judicial branch is established in order to tell us all what the Constitution means. It says that the judicial branch is established to decide cases and controversies arising under this Constitution and the laws. And that is the basis for the authority to interpret the Constitution. As Marshall explained, we have to decide a case. If the argument is that it’s inconsistent with the Constitution, we have to decide that. Therefore, we have that authority, and I believe that’s consistent with the intent of the Framers. But it does mean—and this is the point I was trying to make in that small little Law Review comment—that judges should be very careful to make sure they’ve got a real case or controversy before them, because that is the sole basis for the legitimacy of them acting in the manner they do in a democratic republic. They’re not accountable to the people. As judges they have the obligation to decide cases according to the rule of law. So first make sure you’ve got a real case, and a real case is not simply, you know, I’m interested in this area, I don’t like what the Government’s doing or I don’t like this law, and so I’m going to go to court. What the standing doctrine requires is that you actuallybe injured by what the Government is doing, injured by Congress’s action. Now, the injury doesn’t have to be economic. The Supreme Court has explained in cases like Sierra Club v. Morton, it can be aesthetic, it can be environmental, it can cover a wide range of injuries, but you do have to show some injury that separates you from the general public, so you’re just not voicing a gripe, you’re trying to get a case decided. That’s the importance of the standing doctrine.

Well— 

Well, I think I had the biggest surprise on the first day that I heard cases. Obviously, it’s opening day and the first day of my career, so I prepared as well as I could. And the arguments were great. And went into the conference room, and I had my notes and all the books. It’s just the judges, you know, just the three judges. We bring the record in. We’re surrounded by the U.S. reports, by our Court of Appeals reports, by the United States Code that you folks have written. And I was ready. I’m sitting there, and I remember the Chief Judge, who by tradition sits on a new judge’s first day, and he was there and another judge. And I waited a while, and I looked and they were still waiting. I waited a while longer, and they were still waiting. And finally, the Chief Judge advised me that the tradition was that the junior judge goes first at these discussions, and so I was kind of put on the spot right off the bat. And part of what that conference was like and throughout, really has—I don’t know if I’d say a surprise, but it’s been illuminating to me. The judges really do roll up their sleeves and try to find the right answer. It’s just the judges. But as we say, ‘‘Well, we think this case is controlled by the Smith case,’’ we get out the Smith case. We open it up and look at it, reading over each other’s shoulders and seeing exactly what it says. If somebody says, ‘‘Well, but in this case under the record there was no evidence about this or there was no objection raised about that,’’ well, you get out the record and you look, and there at page 223, you point to it and say, ‘‘Well, here’s where the objection was raised.’’ And the judges are very open. It’s a very encouraging part of the process from my point of view. Nobody goes in there with set views. They want the benefit of the collegial process, the benefit of each other’s views, and you have to be able to substantiate your position. There’s no place for rhetoric. People are pointing to the law, and I found that a very encouraging part of the process, what goes on in the conference room, which was of course a part of the process that I hadn’t participated in before. 

Right. 

Right. And the positive part of that process to me was that nobody was invested in anything other than getting the right result, and they are prepared to be convinced, contrary to initial impressions, and I was as well. It’s, I found, a very encouraging part of the process.

Well, you know, we all of course begin in high school civics with the notion of three branches of Government, the executive, the legislative and the judicial, and we study that. And then only occasionally do people look at the real world and say, ‘‘Well, what is this agency? What is that? Is that legislative or is that judicial or is that executive?’’ Of course, the answer is, well, it’s a little bit of each. It’s exercising power delegated by Congress. It’s executing it in a particular way. It’s issuing regulations that have the force and effect of law, and quite often it’s adjudicating particular disputes.The activities of the administrative agencies are of course the bulk of what judges on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit do, and the principles of administrative law that have recognized the legitimacy of these agencies, and sought to ensure that their exercise of authority is consistent with constitutional provisions by basically—I mean I know the issue can seem arcane to many people, but the fundamentals of administrative law really go back to the basic principles of justice, is someone being given an opportunity to be heard? Is someone being treated fairly? Is someone who’s making a decision doing it for a rational reason or an arbitrary reason?These are the same basic principles that have animated the common law system since the time of Lord Cook, and they are being applied here as well. The objection is often, ‘‘This agency made a decision without adequately hearing our concerns,’’ or ‘‘This agency made an adjudicatory decision without hearing the record evidence,’’ or ‘‘They did not explain.’’ That’s the basic requirement of administrative law, explain your decision. That’s the limitation on arbitrariness, and the agency didn’t explain why it’s doing this.The notion that even in these arcane areas our legal system insists upon the observance of these basic requirements of—I don’t want to say due process as a technical term, but that’s the principle that is being applied. That goes a long way to explaining howthese agencies have been accepted into the constitutional system, because they have been required under principles of administrative law to comply with these basic precepts of procedural regularity.

Well, that was really the basic issue that I faced in the Microsoft case before the D.C. Circuit en banc. There was a lot of argument, academic commentary back and forth, the idea this is a whole new area. You can’t apply the old principles. They don’t work in this context. You need to do something different, the so-called new paradigm and all that.At least the argument that I tried to make on behalf of the States was that the basic principles are the same. The Sherman Act was, as many have said, a charter of economic freedom and that those basic principles do have to be applied regardless of changes in the economics of the underlying businesses or the structure of the markets. Obviously, it requires a great deal of sensitivity on the part of the judges and it’s a really challenge for the lawyers sometimes to be able to understand the economics, to be able to explain them to the judges, and judges appreciate that.But my basic instinct, and it’s nothing more than that, is that the principles are there and the issue is simply application in a new context.

Thank you, Senator. 

No, Senator. No. 

No. 

Well, Senator, in that situation, obviously you want to talk and take into account the views and the heartfelt concerns of the loved one that you are trying to help in that situation because you know how they are viewing this. You know what they mean when they are saying things like what their wishes are and their concerns are. And, of course, consulting with their physician.But it seems to me that in that situation, you do want to understand and make sure that you appreciate the views of the loved one, and only you can do it because—

I’m sorry. 

Well, I wasn’t trying to give a legal view. My point was that, obviously, you look to the views of the person involved, and if it’s a loved one, you are the one who is in a position to make sure that you understand their views and can help them communicate those— 

An end-of-life situation? You know, I do think it’s one of those things that it’s hard to conceptualize until you’re there. I really would be hesitant to say, this is what I would definitely want done or that is what I would definitely want done. You do need to confront that and appreciate all of the different concerns and impulses and considerations— 

Yes. It’s one of those things, I think it’s difficult to put yourself in that position and say, well, with any degree of confidence, if I were suffering and confronting the end of life, this is what I would want to do, or that is what I would want to do. I just—you can theorize it and try to come up with your views or how you would— 

Well, I’m happy to say that as a general matter—

Well, that’s getting into a legal question and you don’t want— 

I think it does, and one of the things that’s important to understand about the Lopez decision as the Court analyzed it, and again, I’m not taking a position on whether it was correctly decided or not— 

My point is that the fix in Lopez, all that the Court was saying was missing in there, or what was different about Lopez than many of the other cases was that lack of a jurisdictional requirement. And if the Act had been, as I understand the Court’s analysis, if the Act had required that, which I think, again, it’s fairly easy to show in almost every case—as you say, these guns are transported in interstate commerce—then that would have been within the Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause. I think it was an unusual feature of the legislation that it didn’t have that requirement as so many laws do. As you know, it often says, you know, in interstate commerce, and that’s, at least as I understand the Lopez decision, what made it unusual. 

Right. 

As a general matter, the answer is no. The treaty power—as long as it’s ratified according to the requirements in the Constitution, by two-thirds of the Senate, you’re perfectly correct. It is, under the Supremacy Clause, the supreme law of the land. Now, I don’t know if there are particular arguments about Executive authority in that area with which I’m not familiar, and I don’t mean to state categorically, but my general understanding is that treaties that are ratified—and, of course, we have treaties that aren’t ratified and Executive agreements that aren’t submitted for ratification and so on, but a treaty that’s ratified by the Senate under the Supremacy Clause is part of the supreme law of the land. Now— 

Yes. Now, there are questions, of course, that arise under those and have arisen under those about interpreting the Conventions and how they apply in particular cases to non-parties to the Convention and so on, and as you know, those cases have been coming up and are being litigated. But that’s an issue of what the Convention means in a particular case, not whether, as a general matter, a treaty is binding. 

Well, the Court has been somewhat inconsistent on some other factors. They, for example, talk about in some cases the length of a precedent, the idea that the longer it’s been on the books, the more people have conformed their conduct to it. In other cases, they’ve suggested that’s not such an important consideration. In Payne v. Tennessee, the case that it noted how closely divided the Court was in the prior case as a factor, but in other cases the Court has said that’s not a major consideration. So I put those factors on the table simply because in some cases, the Court looks to them. In others, it doesn’t. But I think the ones I mentioned yesterday are ones that apply in every case, including the settled expectations, the workability, whether the doctrinal basis of a decision had been eroded. 

Yes. 

Well, I do think you do have to look at those criteria, and the ones that I pull from those various cases are, first of all, the basic principle that it’s not enough that you think the decision was wrongly decided. That’s not enough to justify revisiting it. Otherwise, there’d be no role for precedent, no role for stare decisis. Second of all, one basis for reconsidering it is the issue of workability. If a precedent has turned out not to provide workable rules, if courts get different results in similar cases because they— 

Well, again, that’s a different—that is a precedent of its own— 

The courts held that in the Eisenstadt case, which came shortly after Griswold, largely under principles of equal protection, and I don’t have any quarrel with that conclusion in Eisenstadt. 

Well, that’s where it actually got started 80 years ago, in the earliest cases. Meyer and Pierce involved questions about how to raise children, whether you could teach them a foreign language, whether you could send them to a private school. And those decisions are really what started that body of law. 

Well, Senator, as I’ve explained, that is an area— 

Oh, no, Senator. Whether the question is close or not, I don’t think there’s any situation where a court concludes that the Executive deserves total deference, and that was not the basis of my decision. The judges were unanimous that the veterans were not entitled to relief. The panel was chosen from what happened to be appointees of three different Presidents. The view was unanimous that they were not entitled to relief. The other two judges concluded there was no cause of action available to them. I concluded that there was no jurisdiction and wrote separately. The recognition that it was a close question is also reflected in the view of the other two judges in addressing my concern. They acknowledged that it was a close question, and I agreed with that. But you did have legislation that said that the President can determine that these laws do not apply if he makes a determination under the criteria set forth in the statute, and he had done that, and my conclusion that that extended to the provision that otherwise would have allowed suit. The other two judges disagreed. They thought there was jurisdiction, but then concluded there was no right of action. So the endresult of both of our positions was the same. But it was not a question of deference. It was a question of interpreting the legal authority and consequences of an Act that this body had passed and the President’s finding under that. When it comes to interpreting questions of law, I go back to Marbury v. Madison. That is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial branch. We don’t defer to the Executive. We don’t defer to the legislature in making that final decision about what the law is.

Just to clarify, we certainly defer in the standards of review to make sure that we’re not—but the final decision about what’s constitutional or not rests with the judicial branch. The policy judgments, we certainly defer to the legislature. 

Well, it’s part of what I mean when I say a certain humility should characterize the judicial function. Judges need to appreciate that the legitimacy of their action is confined to interpreting the law and not making it. And if they exceed that function and start making the law, I do think that raises legitimate concerns about legitimacy of their authority to do that. 

Well, I do know that there are sophisticated academic theorists, people who spend a lot more time theorizing in this area than I do, and a lot smarter than I am addressing these issues who—some of whom conclude that in particular cases it’s difficult to do, it’s difficult to avoid making the law while you’re interpreting it, and they kind of throw up their hands and suggest that we shouldn’t even try, therefore.I don’t agree with that. I think as a practical matter, as a pragmatic matter, judges every day know the difference between interpreting the law and making the law. Every day judges put aside their personal views and beliefs and apply the law. Whether the result is one they would agree with as a legislator or not agree with, the question is what the law is, not what they think it should be.I’ve seen that on the court of appeals. I’ve seen that as a practicing lawyer before the court. That is the ideal. I’m sure judges, I’m sure Justices don’t always achieve it in every case because it’s a human endeavor and error is going to infect any human endeavor. But that is the ideal, and I think good judges working hard can not only achieve it but also achieve it together in a collegial way and benefit from the insight and views of each other.

Well, again, barring special circumstances of the sort you were talking about, that’s generally something addressed by State authorities.

That’s my understanding of what the Court held in the Morrison case, yes.

I’m not sure I know the answer to that, Senator. 

I remember tax opinions talking about it, the power to tax being the power to destroy, but— 

Well, the interesting thing, the Court’s most recent decision is the medical marijuana decision in the Raich case. And the Court there looked at the Lopez and Morrison decisions and tried to put them in context and said—because the argument there was based on Lopez and Morrison, saying this is beyond Congress’s power, and the Court said those are only two of our cases and they need to be put in the broad sweep of Commerce Clause precedents for over 200 years. Yes, they are two cases and it had been, I think, 65, 70 years since the Court had focused on limitation under the Commerce Clause and concluded that it was beyond Congress’s power. But the Raich case concluded this was within Congress’s power. They said don’t—it’s not as if Lopez and Morrison are junking all that came before. They just need to be considered in a broad context.And of course there’s decision after decision, going back to Gibbons v. Ogden, one of Chief Justice John Marshall’s early opinions, about the scope of Congress’s power and the recognition under the constitutional scheme that it is a broad grant of power, and the recognition that this body has the authority to determine when issues affecting interstate commerce merit legislative response at the Federal level. I think that’s—

In a vague way, yes. 

Yes. 

Not next week, no. [Laughter.] 

Well, if I am confirmed, Senator, the answer is yes. I am aware that there is, for example, the Administrative Office, and they provide valuable services to judges around the country. As a consumer of their services for the past 2 years, I have, certainly, particular views about where I think they’re effective and helpful to judges and other areas where, like any bureaucracy, where I think they can do better. It is an area where my first priority is going to be to listen, because I’m sure there are many considerations of which I’m not aware that are very important for the Chief Justice to take into account. And after listening, I’ll try to make the best decisions I can about administering that system.

Yes, Senator. The oath we take is to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. That’s true. And the way judges go about that is within a system of precedent and, consistent with rules of stare decisis, no judge starts the day by opening a blank slate and saying what should the Constitution mean today? We operate within those systems of precedence. That’s the best way that judges have determined to interpret the Constitution and laws, consistent with principles of stare decisis.

Well, we talked about this in the Committee hearings on a couple of occasions, and I think everyone would agree that the religion jurisprudence under the First Amendment, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause could be clearer. The Ten Commandments cases are the example right at hand. You have two decisions of the Supreme Court. Only one Justice thinks both are right. That is an area in which I think the Court can redouble its efforts to try to come to some consistency in its approach.Now, it obviously is an area that cases depend in a very significant way on the particular facts, and any time that’s the case the differences may be explained by the facts. You do have the two provisions, as your question recognized, the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. And as I’ve said before, I think that both of those are animated by the principle that the Framers intended, the rights of full citizenship to be available to all citizens without regard to their religious belief or lack of religious belief. That I think is the underlying principle, and hopefully, the Court’s precedents over the years will continue to give life to that ideal.

Senator, thank you. 

I’m sorry. As early as when? 

Well, for the reason I gave in the memorandum. This was a statement by the President, and I just wanted to— didn’t want the President giving out medical advice if it was the subject of some uncertainty. I obviously was not a medical expert, and you said the CDC had issued a report a month before. Well, earlier in your commentary—I don’t know what the 1982 issue was—but I just thought it was—it’s purely a matter of caution and prudence to have the President make a pronouncement on a—you have to remember this was at the very beginning of the AIDS coming into public consciousness, and I was just concerned that the President not be giving out medical statements if people weren’t absolutely sure that it was correct. 

I mean I—the flip side of that, Senator, of course, is if it turned out to be wrong, it could have been disastrous to have the President announcing—because the President wasn’t a medical expert either—and I’m sure my suggestion would have caused the people drafting the President’s speech to go back, and if they thought they were convinced and they were sure, then that’s what would have gone in there. It was just a question of concern. I wanted to make sure that they were 100 percent confident that what the President was going to be saying about a medical issue was they had complete confidence in it. I don’t know actually whether they took it out or left it in, but at least it caused them to focus— 

Well, my judgment—just so I could—it wasn’t my medical judgment. The impact of my suggestion was, obviously to cause to people who wanted that in there to go back and make sure they were sure that they wanted the President of the United States issuing a medical statement. 

I don’t know if that’s an issue that’s going to come before the courts. I don’t know if Congress has taken that step yet, and until it does, I think that’s an issue that I have to maintain some silence on. I think personally I believe that everybody should be treated with dignity in this area, and respect. The legal question of Congress’s authority to address that though is one that could come before the courts, and so I should be—

Well, I don’t know what arguments people would make. I just know that I shouldn’t be expressing an opinion on an issue that could come before the Court.

Well, I mean you’re quite right that there is a dispute among the circuit courts. It’s really a conflict among the circuits. The Fifth Circuit—I think it was in the Emerson case if I’m remembering it correctly—agreed that—with what I understand to be your view, that this protects an individual right. But they went on to say that the right was not infringed in that case. They upheld the regulation there.The Ninth Circuit has taken a different view. I don’t remember the name of the case now, but a very recent case from the Ninth Circuit has taken the opposite view that it protects only a collective right, as they said. In other words, it’s only the right of a militia to possess and not an individual right.Particularly since you have this conflict, cert was denied in the Emerson case, I’m not sure it’s been sought in the other one or willbe, that’s the sort of issue that’s likely to come before the Supreme Court when you have conflicting views. I know the Miller case sidestepped that issue. An argument was made back in 1939 that this provides only a collective right, and the Court didn’t address that. They said instead that the firearm at issue there—I think it was a sawed-off shotgun—is not the type of weapon protected under the militia aspect of the Second Amendment.So people try to read into the tea leaves about Miller and what would come out on this issue, but that’s still very much an open issue.

Anytime you have two different courts of appeals taking opposite positions, I think you have to regard that as a serious question. That’s not expressing a view one way or the other. It’s just saying, I know the Ninth Circuit thinks it’s only a collective right; I know the Fifth Circuit thinks it’s an individual right; and I know the job of the Supreme Court is to resolve circuit conflicts, so I do think that issue is one that’s likely to come before the Court.

Well, because each of the other 8 Justices came to their views in those cases through the judicial process. They confronted that issue with an open mind. They read the briefs presented by the arguments—by the parties, and the arguments the parties presented. They researched the precedents as a judge. They heard the argument in the case. They sat in the conference room, just the 9 of them on the Court, and debated the issues and came to their conclusions as part of the judicial process.You’re now asking me for my opinion outside of that process, not after hearing the arguments, not after reading the briefs, not after the participating with the other judges as part of the collegial process, not after sitting in the conference room and discussing with them their views, being open to their considered views of the case, not after going through the process of writing an opinion, which I have found from personal experience and from observation, often leads to a change in views, the process of the opinion writing. You can’t—the opinion turns out it doesn’t write. You have to change the result. The discipline of writing helps lead you to the right result.You’re asking me for my views, you know, right here without going through any of that process.

Well, the harm would be affecting the appearance of impartiality in the administration of justice. The people who would be arguing in that future case should not look at me and say, ‘‘Well, there’s somebody who under oath testified that I should lose this case because this is his view that he testified to.’’ They’re entitled to have someone consider their case through the whole process I’ve just described, not testifying under oath in response to a question at a confirmation hearing.I think that is the difference between the views expressed in the prior precedent by other Justices in the judicial process and why— as has been the view of all of those Justices—every one of those Justices who participated in that case took the same view with respect to questions concerning cases that might come before them, as I am taking here.

Yes. The specifics of the details I’ve discussed in the response to the Committee’s questionnaire.

I don’t remember the exact date of it. I know it was shortly before that, yeah.

The decision was June 15th. 

May 3rd, yes. But whatever was—I don’t remember the exact dates, but whatever was— 

I’m relying on the—if that’s what I said in the questionnaire, yes. I don’t have an independent recollection. 

I did not, no. 

I don’t want to discuss anything about what’s at issue in the case. The case is still pending, and pending before the Supreme Court. 

Yes. In his official capacity. 

No. I didn’t—that was not my testimony. The opinions in the D.C. Circuit— 

Opinions in the D.C. Circuit are complete and circulated to the panel a week before they’re released. That was my—the conclusion of when work was complete, and again, I wasn’t the author of the opinion—it would have been a week before it was released.

I don’t recall, Senator, and— 

I saw, was made aware of an article—I think it was an article—I don’t remember when that took place, whenever the article was published. And then I understand there was legal opinions on the other side were requested by I believe the Chairman, and I know that those were published— 

I don’t remember the date of the— 

I think it was sometime in July or— 

Well, that was the administration position at the time. It was one that the Supreme Court agreed with; 6–3 I think was the ruling. I know Justice O’Connor was in the majority.The issue—and, again, there was obviously argument a the time about what the issue really was in Herrera. And I thought it was quite inaccurate to view it as a case involving the question of whether actual innocence could be presented, because there was— it was a claim of newly discovered evidence, and it was a claim that somebody who had just died was actually the murderer. At the end of exhaustive appeals through the State system, exhaustive collateral review through the State system, exhaustive collateral review through the Federal system, is there an obligation to decide at that point that a new claim that somebody else committed the crime—

Well, that was the administration position. 

Senator, I think there is always a risk in any enterprise that is a human enterprise like the legal system. Obviously, the objective of the provision of the rights to a criminal defendant and trial, the provision of collateral review at the State level, the provision of collateral review at the Federal level, the availability of, as you suggested, clemency—all of that is designed to ensure that the risk is as low as possible. There are issues that are going to be presented about the availability of DNA evidence which may or may not help reduce the risk even further. There is always a risk. And, obviously, when you’re dealing with something like capital punishment, the risk is something that has to be taken extremely seriously at every stage of the process. As we talked about more than 2 years ago at the prior hearing, I think the most effective way of minimizing that risk is to ensure that people facing that sanction have the best counsel available at every stage. As you know from looking at this problem, the issue that comes up are questions that weren’t raised that should have been raised if the person had a more capable lawyer, avenues that weren’t pursued that should have been pursued if that lawyer had the resources. And that’s where I think the risk of wrongful convic-tion is going to be most effectively addressed, ensuring the availability of competent counsel at every stage of the proceeding.

Thank you, Senator Feingold. Senator Graham? 

Yes. 

I think that would be the logical conclusion of some— 

Very much, Senator, yes. 

No, Senator, I was not. 

The concern that the Attorney General had, and the President, was that changing section 2 to the so-called effects test would cause courts to adopt a proportionality requirement, that if elected representatives were not elected in proportion to the racial composition in a particular jurisdiction, that there would be a violation shown that would have to be redressed. 

No, Senator, and I would resist the suggestion that I am racially insensitive. I know why the phrase ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law’’ is carved in marble above the Supreme Court entrance. It is because of the fundamental commitment of the rule of law to ensure equal justice for all people without regard to race or ethnic background or gender. The courts are a place where people need to be able to go to secure a determination of their rights under the law in a totally unbiased way. That’s a commitment all judges make when they take a judicial oath.

That was its determination in Mobile v. Bolden. 

Yes, Senator. 

Yes, Senator. 

I do, yes. 

Well, my understanding in general is it’s an effort to bring civilized standards to conduct of war, a generally uncivilized enterprise throughout history; an effort to bring some protection and regularity to prisoners of war in particular. And I think that’s a very important international effort. 

Yes, Senator, I am. 

Well, I really have to— 

Those cases are both pending, the ones that I have decided are pending before the Supreme Court, and those issues are likely to come before it. 

I think that’s a fair description, yes. 

Yes, he divided up the area basically into three parts, and considering the executive’s authority, and said when it has the support of Congress, it’s at its greatest. And obviously when it’s in opposition to Congress, it’s at its lowest ebb, as he put it. And he described a middle area in which it was sometimes difficult to tell whether Congress was supporting the action or not. 

I think that’s correct, Senator, yes. 

I don’t know, Senator, and I hesitate to opine on that without knowing. 

My observation during our meeting, Senator, was not an expression of legal determination, and it doesn’t necessarily mean a view that Congress’s action or involvement would be determinative or would even be within the scope of legal authority, depending on what the issue and the arguments were.I do know that when you are in the middle area where it’s difficult to determine whether Congress is supporting the President’s action or is opposed to the President’s action, that the Court often has to try to read the tea leaves of related legislation. If you look at the Dames and Moore decision coming out of the Iranian hostage crisis, what the Court did in that case, applying the middle tier, was look at a vast array of legislation. And it was a very difficult enterprise to try to figure out what Congress’s view was. My point was simply that if we’d know what Congress’s view was, it might make it easier to apply it in a particular case, and you wouldn’t have to go through that process of trying to determine what position Congress was in, if that turned out to be pertinent under the particular legal challenge.

That was read from the Jackson—I do. I agree with the basic proposition that the President’s authority is at its greatest when he has the support of Congress. 

Well, if I am confirmed, I think one of the things that the Chief Justice should have as a top priority is to try to bring about a greater degree of coherence and consensus in the opinions of the Court. I know that has been—it was a priority of the last Chief Justice. I actually believe that is something that should be a matter of concern for all of the Justices. But as the Chief, with responsibility for assigning opinions, I think he has greater scope for authority to exercise in that area, and perhaps over time can develop greater persuasive authority to make the point. Again, coming from the Chief, it may be a point that other Justices would receive—be more receptive to than they might coming from one of their colleagues, that we are not benefited by having six different opinions in a case, that we do need to take a step and think whether or not we really do feel strongly about a point on which a Justice is writing a separate concurrence which only he or she is joining, or whether the majority opinion could be revised in a way that wouldn’t affect anyone’s commitment to the judicial oath to decide the cases as they see fit, but would allow more Justices to join the majority so the Court speaks as a Court. That is something that the priority should be, to speak as a Court.

I think the Court should be as united behind an opinion of the Court as it possibly can. Now, obviously, in many cases it is not going to be possible.

Well, I think that question depends obviously on the modifier and what you mean by ‘‘general.’’ I noted in going over the nomination hearings of Justice Breyer, he also said that the privacy interest is within the—is protected as part of the liberty— protected by the Due Process Clause. I think that is the general approach. Now the—

Well, I wouldn’t use the phrase ‘‘general’’ because I don’t know what that means. I don’t know if by saying ‘‘general’’ they are trying to describe the particular scope to the right to privacy or not. I think there is a right to privacy protected as part of the liberty guarantee in the Due Process Clause.

Protected substantively, yes. 

No. I think his statement obviously focuses on general, and his conclusion in that case was that the right to privacy protected under the Due Process Clause that you noted he acknowledged at his hearings did not extend to include the activity at issue in Lawrence. 

I’m not willing to state a particular view on the Lawrence decision, and that’s consistent with the approach that I’ve taken.

Well, Senator, I’m not going to comment on whether I think particular cases were correctly decided or not in areas—

Well, I don’t know which cases you’re talking about. 

Well, that would be commenting on whether that decision was correctly decided or not. If I’m agreeing or disagreeing with one of the Justices’ views in that case, that would be commenting on whether that view was correct or not. If it was in a dissent, it would be disagreeing; if it was in the majority, it would be agreeing. And because those are in areas that could come before the Court, like every other nominee to come before this Committee who is on the Court today, I think it’s inappropriate to comment on the correctness or incorrectness of those decisions in areas that could come before the Court. 

Well, again, my view on privacy is as I’ve expressed, that there is a right to privacy, protected as part of the liberty under the Due Process Clause. 

I don’t know what ‘‘general’’ means. 

Well, substantive, yes, I have said that, that the protection extends to substantive protection. But when you say general, I don’t know what that means. I don’t know if that means— 

His conclusion was that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause did not extend to that right, yes. 

No, Senator, you’re asking me whether the right to privacy protected under the Liberty Clause extends to a particular right, the right at issue in Lawrence. 

I have said there is a substantive right to privacy.

No. As I understand it—and, again, his testimony as a nominee was that there was. What he said is—the quote you read in Lawrence said there’s no general right to privacy. Now, I don’t know—

No, I think, Senator, that his conclusion in Lawrence was that whatever right there was, it did not extend to the activity that was at issue in Lawrence.

Well, it’s consistent with the approach I’ve taken, that I don’t think it’s appropriate to protect—as necessary to protect the independence and integrity of the Court to comment on whether that decision was correctly decided or not. And that is consistent with the approach that every member of the Court has taken—

It’s rare on our court, I’m happy to— 

Well, actually, at one point the statistics always showed that more cases were unanimous than anything else. 

There are a lot.

Yes. 

I agree with that, yes. 

Yes. 

No. 

Yes. 

On occasion, yes. 

Yes. 

Senator, I’ll explain why she expressed her views on that particular issue. It was an explanation that she gave at the time, that she had written extensively on that subject and she thought that her writings were fair game for discussion. She took a different view—

I think, because the Justices have followed the approach that I am following, and as I said, I’ve gone back and read every one of the transcripts for the Justices, they have avoided commenting on whether they think decisions were correctly decided or not. If you look at what Justice Ginsburg said when she was asked whether she thought the Mayer and Harris cases were correctly decided, you will see she said, I’m not going to comment on that. She said, I know what the precedents are, I have no agenda to overrule them, and that’s all I’m going to say.

My understanding— 

My understanding of the cases she felt it appropriate to comment on, as I’ve said, were the ones where she had already written on it. And she said, I think my writings are appropriate. 

I thought she adhered to her view. Her view was no hints, no forecasts, no previews. That’s exactly what she said. That’s an exact quote from her hearing transcript. 

Well, Senator, I’ll give the same answer I gave yesterday to Senator Graham when he asked if I would be in the mold of the Chief Justice. And the answer is I will be my own man on the Supreme Court. Period.

I’m not going to criticize them with respect to any general description of that sort. I’m sure there are cases where I would agree with them, there are cases where I would disagree with them, as with all of the Justices. 

Well, that was a—it was a reflection of the views of the Attorney General at the time, and that was part of the administration’s position. 

I don’t think it was official policy. It was an expression that the Attorney General had made on various occasions. 

Mr. Chairman, could I address some of the—

Well, there were several along the way. I will be very succinct.

Oh, well, then. [Laughter.] 

First, ‘‘Dr. Zhivago’’ and ‘‘North by Northwest.’’ [Laughter.] 

On the more important subject, I— 

The only— 

The only point I would like to make, because you raised the question how is this different than Justices who dissent and criticize and how is this different than professors. And I think there are significant differences. The Justice who files a dissent is issuing an opinion based upon his participation in the judicial process. He confronted the case with an open mind, he heard the arguments, he fully and fairly considered the briefs, he consulted with his colleagues, he went through the process of issuing an opinion. And in my experience, every one of those stages can cause you to change your view. The view you ask, then, of me, well, what do you think, is it correct or not, or how would you come out, that’s not a result of that process. And that is why I shouldn’t respond to those types of questions. Now, the professor, how is that different? That professor is not sitting here as a nominee before the Committee. And the great danger of courts that I believe every one of the Justices has been vigilant to safeguard against is turning this into a bargaining process. It is not a process under which Senators get to say I want you to rule this way, this way, and this way. And if you tell me you’ll rule this way, this way, and this way, I’ll vote for you. That is not a bargaining process. Judges are not politicians. They cannot promise to do certain things in exchange for votes. And if you go back and look at the transcripts, Senator, I would just respectfully disagree. I think I have been more forthcoming than any of the other nominees. Other nominees have not been willing to tell you whether they thought Marbury v. Madison was correctly decided. They took a very strict approach. I have taken what I think is a more pragmatic approach and said if I don’t think that’s likely to come before the Court, I will comment on it. And, you know, again, perhaps that’s subject to criticism, because it is difficult to draw the line sometimes. But I wanted to be able to share as much as I can with the Committee in response to the concerns you and others have expressed, and so I have adopted that approach. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sorry—thank you for the accommodation.[Recess 4:13 to 5:10 p.m.] 

Glad we’re back. 

Thank you. [Laughter.] 

Yes, Senator. 

I hope my answer would be the same, Senator. 

Well, that actually goes back very far in our history, as you know, to the early States when John Jay, I believe, as the first Chief Justice, was asked for his opinion on a matter, and he made the determination that it would be inappropriate to give that kind of advice. It was really one of the leading historical episodes that contributed to implementing the separation of powers. I think he appreciated that if he started just giving advice on legal questions that were of concern to the President, that he would be acting more like an Attorney General and it wouldn’t be separated from the Executive. And then he would be in a position of giving the President advice, while at the same time ruling on the legality of his conduct. I think the reason John Jay decided that was not appropriate for these new judges on the new Supreme Court to give advisory opinions is because he appreciated that they were in theJudicial Department, as the Constitution put it, not in the Executive Department, or if the advice, request for advice had come from the Legislature. It’s an important part of the separation of powers that our courts don’t give advisory opinions.Now, some State courts do have a different system of separation of powers, and in some State courts the Supreme Court will give an advisory opinion, but the Federal rule has always been that you have to have a constitutional case or controversy.

It’s in Article III, yes. 

No. The requirement of an actual case or controversy is derived from the Constitution. There are some aspects of standing doctrine that are, they say, prudential, in other words, that it’s up to the Court whether to apply them or not, but the core requirement, that the litigants have a stake in the issue, a case or controversy, is a constitutional requirement. 

Well, it’s hard to know whether it trumps something until you know what the other something is, and that includes what the legislation might be. I’ve had many questions before this Committee about the importance of deferring to the legislature in areas in which Congress is given authority under the Constitution. Well, as a judge, before I would propound the idea of right, that it does not matter what the issue is on the other side, I would like to know if a legislature had addressed that issue. Now, sometimes, as you know, legislatures can exceed their constitutional bounds and there are rights under the Constitution that individuals have that trump efforts by the legislature to address those or infringe upon them, but you need to know what the issue is in terms of the conflict between an asserted right and an asserted power of the legislature. I do not think members of a legislative body would accept the principle that you would decide a case like that without even knowing what the legislature had enacted or what the issue was or why they had decided that this was an appropriate area of legislation. That is not deciding the controversy. It is just saying we need to have the issue narrowed in a way that courts are familiar with addressing.

Well, judges, when they sit down to decide a case, when the cases come into the chambers, judges don’t sit and decide, well, what do I think about issues under the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment or the Seventh Amendment. They want to know what the case is about, and that begins with knowing what the factual dispute is about and what the record is. Then they want to know what law applies in resolving that question. And they want to know what the arguments are. That’s why we have briefs on one side, then briefs on the other. And I’m sure you’ve had the same experience that I’ve had, which is that you find the opening brief can be very persuasive; then you move on to the second one, and you see it in an entirely different light. And maybe your view of the case will change again as you consult with your colleagues on the bench or as you hear the oral argument.I know I spent a lot of time doing those briefs and arguments, and I certainly hope they had some impact on a case from time to time. And then when you sit down with the judges, all of these things, your view of the case is going to change in some way at every stage. And to say that it’s the same thing when you sit down and ask an abstract question as when you have been through the judicial process and reached a decision, including having to reduce it to writing, the requirement that judges write opinions is an important discipline on the decisional process, because—and those opinions are going to be submitted to the public, and everyone is going to be able to see your reasoning. And so it has to be coherent and reasonable and something that can stand the glare of publicity and the scrutiny of scholars and other judges.That’s a very important discipline. It means—it’s quite a bit different than saying, well, what do you think about this and whatever opinion you might give.

Hamdan was the one that— 

Hamdi was the one in the— 

It is a common source of confusion. 

No, I’m not, Senator. 

Well, Senator, I hope we haven’t gotten to the point where the Supreme Court’s opinions are so abstruse that the educated lay person can’t pick them up and read them and understand them. You shouldn’t have to be a lawyer to understand what the Supreme Court opinions mean. One of the reasons I’ve given previously for admiring Justice Jackson is he was one of the best writers the Court has ever had, and I think you didn’t have to be a lawyer to pick up one of his opinions and understand exactly what his reasoning is and why he is saying that, and if he is citing and relying on precedents, he cites them and explains them. They are not written in jargon or legalese, but an educated person whose life, after all, is being affected by these decisions can pick them up and read them, and you don’t have to hire a lawyer to tell you what it means. I hope we haven’t gotten to a point where that is an unattainable ideal. Now, I’m not suggesting that I’ve always lived up to that, and I’d hate to have somebody go back and look at my opinions and critique them under that exacting standard. But I do think that’s something that it’s worth shooting for, at least in most cases, that opinions should be accessible to educated people without regard to whether they’re lawyers or not. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, Senator, I think there are many things that people could look to. You said I had a comfortable life. I think that’s a fair characterization. I had a middle-class upbringing in Indiana. As part of that, I worked in the steel mills outside of Gary during the summers, as soon as I was old enough to do that, and throughout my life have been exposed to and mixed with at school, learned and played with people of a wide variety of backgrounds. Comfortable, yes, but isolated, in no sense.I was, I would say, a typical middle-class kid growing up in Indiana and had, I think, a great upbringing. I was privileged in the sense of having my parents and sisters contributing to my upbringing and education. And I think people looking at my life would see someone in that experience, and obviously with limitations. I wasn’t raised in other places in the country. I might have a different perspective if I were. I wasn’t raised in different circumstances and would have different experiences if I were. If you look at the Supreme Court, the people there come from widely different backgrounds and experiences, and I think that’s a healthy thing.But as far as someone going into Court and looking to see why they would expect to get a fair hearing from me, I think—and I can answer this with respect to the court I am on now. It’s hard for me to imagine what their case is about that I haven’t been on their side at some point in my career. If it’s somebody who’s representing welfare recipients who have had their benefits cut off, I’ve done that. If it’s somebody who’s representing a criminal defendant who’s facing a long sentence in prison, I’ve done that. If it’s a prosecutor who’s doing his job to defend society’s interest against crimi-nals, I have been on the side of the prosecution. If it’s somebody who’s representing environmental interests, environmentalists in the Supreme Court, I’ve done that. If it’s somebody who’s representing the plaintiffs in an antitrust case, I’ve been in that person’s shoes; I’ve done that. If it’s somebody representing a defendant in an antitrust case, I’ve done that as well.It’s one of the, I think, great benefits of the opportunity I’ve had to practice law as I have, is that it has not been a specialized practice. I have not just represented one side or the other. I’ve represented all of those interests. And I think those people will know that have had their perspective. I’ve been on the other side of the podium with a case just like theirs, and that should, I hope—and I hope it does now—encourage them that I will be fair and that I will decide the case according to the law, but I will have seen it from their perspective.

No, Senator, I did not. The result in the case, I did lose. I lost 5–4, if I’m remembering correctly. In other words, four of the Justices on the Supreme Court thought the argument we were—I was making on behalf of my client was correct. It has always been my position that I do not sit in judgment other than once I’ve satisfied myself that the legal arguments are reasonable ones, within the mainstream, if you will, that I don’t decide whether that’s the way I would rule as a judge or whether I would rule the other way.My practice has been to take the cases that come to me, and if the other side in that case had come to me first, I would have taken their side.

That’s a judgment for the legal system to make. They’re asserting legal rights. Lawyers aren’t judges when they’re representing clients. They don’t sit there and say—or maybe some do. I don’t. I think it’s a basic fundamental principle of the legal system and the bar that you take clients who have reasonable arguments—now, I’m not talking about frivolous arguments. I don’t take cases in which those are raised. But the lawyers aren’t the judges. The judges are.Now, the case you mentioned, you’ve explained the arguments on one side. There were legal arguments on the other side, and four Justices agreed with those. This isn’t an extreme case when it’s decided 5–4. And that’s one of the very points I was making earlier, that I take cases on all sides of the issue. You can go through and find cases. For example, when I was asked to assist an inmate on Florida’s death row, I didn’t step back and say, Well, is this really a good thing for me to assist this individual guilty of—convicted of particular murders? I took the case. When the various pro bono activities in which my firm was involved, I didn’t sit in judgment and say, Is that something I agree with? Is it not something I agree with?I was a lawyer involved in that area of the law, and I thought it my obligation to take the cases that come in.

Well—

Well, I think, Senator, if I’m remembering the memo—and it was 23 years ago, and the case that was decided was, I believe, again, a divided decision by the Supreme Court. If I’m remembering the memo correctly, it was making the point that the position was inconsistent with the Attorney General’s litigation policy approach, if that’s the right memorandum.

Well, in that case, again, as a staff lawyer, I thought it was my obligation to call to the Attorney General’s attention activities in the Department that I thought were inconsistent with what he had articulated as his approach. And that is what I would have been doing in that case. And, again, it would have been apparently supporting the State of Texas in its legislative determination in that area. 

I don’t—I haven’t looked at the decision in Plyler v. Doe in 23 years, Senator, and there is nothing gratuitous about the memorandum. It obviously came out because the decision came out. That would have been why I was advising the Attorney General with respect to it. Obviously, the importance of the availability of education for all is vital. That’s a different question than the legal issues involved and whether a State law should be struck down. 

Senator, as I said, I have not looked at the decision in Plyler v. Doe in 23 years. It’s not an area that I’ve focused on. And the issue is not my policy view about what is a good idea for educational policy or national policy or whether what the Texas legislators determined was a good idea for Texas policy. The question was a particular legal issue, and, again, the Supreme Court was divided on that, so it is not as if we are talking about a position outside the mainstream. And what I was explaining, this was viewed, as the memo states, if it were looked at in full, it was something that I thought was inconsistent with what I understood the Attorney General’s approach to be, and it was my job to call that to his attention, which is what I did. 

Of course. Well, of course, Senator. 

And then the decision in Plyler is a precedent of the Court. I don’t think it—I’m not aware that it’s been called into question in the intervening 23 years that have passed since the time I wrote those two paragraphs in the memo. And that is a precedent that is entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. And it’s something that is where I would begin if an issue arose in this area. I’m not aware that any is arising in this area, but if an issue were to arise, that’s where I would begin, with the precedent that— 

Well, Senator, if I could just make the point that the issue is not whether or not I thought it was a good idea. That’s not the job of a lawyer presenting legal advice and legal—the legal implications of an issue to his boss, the Attorney General. He wasn’t interested in whether I thought it was a good idea or not. He was interested in the legal question of whether or not this was consistent with his policy and his approach. That’s not taking refuge. That’s explaining the circumstances of a memorandum. And it’s not avoiding an expression about whether it’s a good idea or not. It’s explaining that what we’re dealing with— 

Senator, do you—I don’t think you want judges who will decide cases before them under the law on what they think is good, simply good policy for America. There are legal questions there. And I’m sure there are clients that I have represented in court that you would agree with. You would say that’s the right side of the cause to be on, whether it’s the environmental interests I represented in the Tahoe case, whether it’s the welfare recipients I represented pro bono in the Bivens case, whether it’s the cause of the inmate on death row that I assisted in in Florida, whether it’s the environmental interests in Glacier Bay that I represented or in the Grand Canyon on a pro bono basis. I’m sure I could go down my list of clients and find clients that you would say that’s the right side, that’s the cause of justice, and there are others with whom you disagree.My point is simply this, that in representing clients, in serving as a lawyer, it’s not my job to decide whether that’s a good idea or a bad idea. The job of the lawyer is to articulate the legal arguments on behalf of the client.

Well, I think it’s important, and again, to women on both sides of the issue and also, I think, to men as well, but obviously it’s an issue that directly affects women. It’s a fundamental question, as the Court has addressed in Roe and in Casey, that obviously affects the lives directly of millions of Americans, and the availability of rights under that decision affects women. But I know there are people of strongly held views on both sides of the issue. And I know that the responsibility of a judge confronting this issue is to decide the case according to the rule of law consistent with the precedents, not to take sides in a dispute as a matter of policy, but to decide it according to the law.And to the extent that your questions earlier about, you know, causes we agree with, causes we don’t agree with, I do want to emphasize that there is a unifying theme in my approach, both as a lawyer and as a judge. And that is the cause that I believe in passionately, the one to which I have devoted my professional career, is the vindication of the rule of law. And I tried to explain in my opening statement on Monday why that’s important. Because without it, any other rights that you may agree with as a matter of policy are meaningless. You need to have courts that will enforce the rule of law if you’re going to have rights that mean anything.

It is my handwriting. It’s a list. It’s apparently a meeting to discuss a number of civil rights issues, six of them, I see. I did not participate in any way in the Bob Jones case. It was apparently discussed, according to this memo, at the meeting. The recusal rule that was at issue says that I shouldn’t participate by way of consultation or advice, and I did not.

Senator, I’m not sure that I can put the two together side by side and talk about it other than to say that I think the Court tends to address each case on its own terms, and in the case of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, I do know that we’re dealing there with an extraordinarily extensive record in that case. The judicial opinions addressing the issue before three-judge District Court I know went on for several hundred pages, just dealing with records and the issues involved, the record that had been developed, including before Congress.My reading of the Court’s opinion in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act case is that that was a case where the Court’s decision was driven in large part by the record that had been compiled by Congress. I think the determination there was based—just reading the opinion, there’s no great insight—that the extensive record carried a lot of weight with the Justices.Now, with respect to the other areas, again, I think the Court would tend to look at those, sort of put the one case aside and then move on to the next case, and they’re dealing there with developments in that area, and again I—

Only in the sense, Senator, that obviously they come out different ways, and your point that the political speech is generally regarded as at the core of what the First Amendment was designed to protect, and some of the other speeches is not. I certainly appreciate that concern, but whether—again, whether the particular cases were correctly decided or not is not something I feel is appropriate for me to discuss.

Yes. The Framers regarded that as the basis legislative power, the power of the purse.

Yes. Alexander Hamilton, in making his point— I think it was Hamilton—that this was the least dangerous branch, emphasized that the courts have neither the power of the sword nor the power of the purse.

Well, Congress historically has done that. The Spending Clause power, for example, South Dakota v. Dole said that if you accept Federal Highway funds, you have to raise the drinking age to 21, and that was upheld by the Supreme Court. So certainly as a general proposition the Congress has that authority. I consider it a case involving a waiver of sovereign immunity. The condition on the receipt of Federal funds was that Washington’s Metro system waive its sovereign immunity with respect to disability claims, and by a 2–1 vote we upheld that exercise of authority under the Spending Clause.

I think that’s an accurate conclusion of the holding in that case. Again, without expressing views on correctness or not, since that’s where the line has been drawn in terms of what nominees can say, my understanding is that that court rejected the conclusion. It went through the analysis of what liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause included, and it concluded that there wasn’t a right under the Liberty Clause that trumped the regulation that was at issue in that case.

Once the Court concluded that there wasn’t a fundamental right that was in conflict with the State regulation, then the Court applied the rational relation test to uphold the State law.

It would be subject to the same analysis as any other precedent of the Court, yes.

Some of the Court’s cases talk about how long an opinion has been standing. Some of the Court’s cases say that is less of a factor, but it is a decision of the Court, a precedent on that issue. Any question of revisiting it would have to be consistent with the principles of stare decisis, and we have talked about those principles and how they apply.

Yes. 

Yes, Senator. 

Yes. 

I know that Congress did just that with respect to the old Fifth Circuit, which used to run from Florida out through Texas, and they split it into the new Fifth Circuit and the 11th Circuit. I don’t think any questions have been raised about Congress’s authority to do that. 

Well, I wouldn’t want to— 

Thank you, Senator. 

No, I am fine. 

Yes. 

Well, before the Revolution, of course, we were under the British legal system.

Go back under the legal system in Britain to the Magna Carta and the dispute between the King and the lords there as they tried to establish their rights against the King or the central government, was a key part of the development of English law since that time. 

Thank you, Senator. 

That is something that I thought about, Senator, at greater length before I came onto the court of appeals as little more than 2 years ago. I think it’s a common concern, that judges are isolated. There’s some natural tendency to that. You find that lawyers that you used to socialize with don’t feel they can talk to you anymore, and other people, again, a certain distance develops. And it is something that my wife and I talked about at the time. And I concluded, and she made the point, that it was a great blessing to me to have our children. They will obviously keep us in touch with things outside of the isolation of the law. There are a lot of soccer games and swim meets and things of that sort in my future for the next 15 years and I’ll be seeing people not just involved with the law, not just involved with the Court, but other parents and other children in those activities. And I think that willbe a very healthy part of an effort to keep in touch with things outside the isolated marble palaces.

Well, sure, Senator, but there have always been areas in which I’ve continued to be active that keep me involved with other people. I mentioned, I think yesterday, the Street Law Program that I’ve been a part of for more than 15 years, which—

I certainly will. I continued that when I became a judge and plan on continuing it as well. It’s jointly sponsored by the Supreme Court Historical Society, and that brings high school teachers. And I’ve always found that extremely rewarding because they have a very different perspective. They’re obviously dealing with children a little further along at that stage, but they’re not lawyers. And they’re here to try to understand the law. And I have always enjoyed very much their questions and sharing with them why the Supreme Court is so important to the rule of law, and allowing them the opportunity. They go in and they see the Court in action, as it were, and then they go back. And it helps them talk to their students about something that I think is critically important for those students to know. 

Well, it’s hard to look ahead and see how that would work. I have as—I know, for example, when I was a lawyer and handling a case about native village rights in Alaska, I went to the native villages. I’ve always thought that was an important part about understanding the real-world consequences of any case—to get on the ground. When I handled a case involving people on the assembly line, I went to the assembly line and saw what it was like. I went to these villages that you could only reach by boat or by plane, where they make do with so little because of the remoteness. And I’ve always viewed that as an important part of understanding any case that I’ve been involved in. 

Oh. 

Senator, I’d have to just say I don’t know who wrote it. It obviously was submitted by both of us. I don’t remember. 

Well, Senator, I don’t know if it was from both of us. I don’t know who wrote it. If my name is on it, it’s on it. But I agree, of course, that children should be educated. The example I just gave of my activities with the Street Law Program focuses on the importance of education for children. The legal issues presented in that case and the question of whether or not it was consistent with the Attorney General’s litigation approach and program, those are different questions from the basic issue of whether children should be educated.

Certainly. 

Not at all. Happy to. 

A measured effort that can withstand strict scrutiny is, I think, a—affirmative action of that sort, I think, is a very position approach. And I think people will disagree about exactly what the details should be, but the general notion— 

In Michigan. In the Michigan case, obviously, you have—I always get the—whether it’s the law school—I think the law school program was upheld and the university program was struck down because of the differences in the program. But efforts to ensure the full participation in all aspects of our society by people without regard to their race, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs—all of those are efforts that I think are appropriate. At the time of the Reagan administration, President Reagan was at painsto make clear, and I know the Attorney General was as well, that in opposing quotas—and at the time, it was a much stricter quota approach that was being proposed, set-asides—they were not in any way opposed to what they regarded as beneficial affirmative action to bring minorities, women into all aspects of society. That’s important, and as the Court has explained, we all benefit from that.

Senator, first of all— 

I can, Senator. But I do need to clarify. At the beginning you said something that, what I did in the Rancho Viejo case, and that was not what I did. The only thing that I did in my opinion—and again, there was another opinion that analyzed it and made a determination of whether it was constitutional. I did not join that opinion determining that it was unconstitutional. I simply said that we need to look at these other grounds on which to sustain the Endangered Species Act. We should consider it en banc. There was another court suggesting that our approach was inconsistent with the Supreme Court opinions. When I was confirmed for the court of appeals, everybody wanted to know will you follow the Supreme Court opinions? And I told you I would. And here we have a court of appeals suggesting you’re not following them, and I said, well, let’s take the case en banc. I did not state an opinion on whether the Commerce Clause requirement was satisfied or not. I said let’s take it en banc and consider these other grounds. The other grounds went to precisely the issue and the question that you asked. If we had looked at it under the other grounds, which was the commercial activity surrounding the endangered species, in other words, the issue that one other court of appeals had said, for example, there is commercial activity surrounding endangered species that takes place nationwide, not limited to where the particular species is, and that would satisfy the commercial activity require-ment and allow the Court to apply Wickard under the Supreme Court’s precedents—

That was the problem that was presented—as my opinion tried to set forth, that’s the problem that was presented with the approach that the panel took, and I thought we ought to re-hear it and look at these other grounds where you don’t have to ask whether there is impact on interstate commerce from the particular species, the very point you—

Well, in those areas, again, the commercial impact of pollution, those are things that I think are not going to present as difficult an issue remotely as if you look at each individual species. The whole point of my argument in the dissent was there was another way to look at this that would allow you to not have to look at the interstate impact of the one particular species. They were grounds that the Court in a panel opinion said they did not have to reach because they had taken this other approach that the Fifth Circuit was suggesting was inconsistent with our approach. And all I said—and, again, it is important to recognize, I did not say that even in this case the decision was wrong, that it was unconstitutional. Another judge dissenting did say that. I did not join that opinion. I simply said let’s look at these other grounds for decision because that doesn’t present this problem.

Thank you, Senator. 

Thirteen. 

Well, Senator, I think that’s a very hard question to answer for a number of reasons. One, as you know, almost all of our opinions are unanimous. We don’t parse ourselves out according to an ideological spectrum. 

I don’t know where I fall. I do know that I saw recently a study that was done that indicated I agree more with some judges appointed by Democratic Presidents than I do with judges appointed by other Republicans Presidents, and it’s not simply lined up according to the President who appointed you. There are judges there that I’ve joined in opinions where I’ve found myself—where we have had dissents. There are some—I know one case we were talking about earlier, the Bombardier case, Judge Rogers and I were in one position, Judge Rogers appointed by President Clinton, and Judge Garland was in a different position. I know in another case that was decided that we have talked about, Barber, Judge Garland and I were on one side and Judge Sentelle dissented.So to the extent there have been divisions, I think you could go and see and they would be completely non—

Well, I don’t. 

And the judges, I think, on the D.C. Circuit generally don’t either. 

No, I think that would be— 

Sure. I guess I would think the clearest juxtaposition would be the cases from the Lochner era. If you take Lochner on the one hand and, say, West Coast Hotel, which kind of overruled and buried the Lochner approach on the other, and the immodesty that I see in the Lochner opinion is in its re-weighing of the legislative determination. You read that opinion, it’s about limits on how long bakers can work. And they’re saying we don’t think there’s any problem with bakers working more than 13 hours. 

Well, the legislature thought there was, and they passed a law about it, and the issue should not have been, Judges, do you think this was a good law or do you think bakers should work longer or not? It should be: Is there anything in the Constitution that prohibits the legislature from doing that? 

Well— 

You know, people talk about Brown v. Board of Education, and let me explain why I think that is an example. It’s obviously a dramatic departure in American history, and in many respects very bold. Yet I think it’s more appropriately understood as a restrained decision compared to the decision that came before in Plessy v. Ferguson. And you can see this if you look at the arguments of the lawyers, because what John W. Davis was arguing on the side of the Board was to the Court, ‘‘You need to be worried about the social consequences of upsetting this decision. People have lived their lives this way. If you overturn this, it is going to be disruptive, the consequences are going to be bad.’’Thurgood Marshall, on the other side, was making a legal argument addressed to the obligation of the Court to apply the rule of law, and he said, focused on the discrimination involved in the separation. He made an argument, and it was a very clever approach to the case because he based his decision on precedent as well, saying ‘‘You have had this recent case in Sweatt v. Painter. Don’t talk to me about Plessy v. Ferguson. You are beginning the process of departing from that. Your recent decision here, if you are going to be consistent, you have to come out this way.’’So again it seems odd I know to talk about things like modesty in such a bold decision, but it is in my view a more appropriate judicial restrained decision.

Well, I think if you take— 

Well, sometimes the appropriate restrained approach—now, with Brown my point was the notion of precedent was one that Thurgood Marshall appreciated in arguing to the Court that it shouldn’t be simply a debate. He didn’t want to debate it on John W. Davis’s terms about Plessy, should it be overruled or not? He said, ‘‘Here’s another precedent of the Court.’’ So he was arguing from precedent as well. 

Well, I think a modest approach requires beginning with the body of precedent. That is what judges do, and that’s a recognition just as Professor Ford said, that we’re not necessarily, we’re not smarter than our fathers who laid down this precedent. 

Professor Ford, yes. My point with respect to Brown was that Thurgood Marshall appreciated that and then he was making an argument from precedent, just as the way Davis was, and they kind of I think gave the Court some comfort in de-parting from Plessy, that they had already taken the initial step in Sweatt v. Painter.

No, no. 

If it’s 20 years ago it would have been— 

It would have been in the White House Counsel’s Office. 

And the memo that you are referring to is, obviously, it’s speculation about what happened in the case. 

It’s not a question about me being a judge. It’s a question about my describing what I was obviously speculating was going on in that particular case. 

Saying that the effort was not misguided referred to what I had been speculating was the Chief Justice’s effort to reformulate the approach in that case, and it’s the Lemon test, and we’ve talked about the Lemon test before, and the pluses and minuses. I’ve described it I think it was today, maybe yesterday. It is a survivor. I noted when we argued the Lee v. Weisman case,that every—six of the Justices I think had taken the position critical of the Lemon test, six of the sitting Justices. They never took it at the same time. It is still the test that applies, and it would be, the precedent that I would begin with—

Well, I’ll try, Senator. It is a neutral principle. Your suggestion that I apply it in cases where I want to but don’t— is of course a grievous insult to any judge, the notion that they’re result-oriented, that they would apply a particular approach one way in one sort of cases and a different way in another case. That’s not how I approach judging and not how I would approach judging whether I’m back on the court of appeals or somewhere else.It is a neutral principle. It reflects the—and it’s obviously not an original concept with me.

There are judges, you go back throughout our history, that have articulated and recognized the principle of judicial restraint, that there are limits on what the judge can do. And those judges have always explained that this applies whether or not I’m in favor of a particular result or not. It’s a reflection of their institutional authority in their role, that their job is to interpret the law, not to make the law. And that applies without regard to what law you would like to have made or not. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Good morning, Mr. Chairman. 

Well, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience, Senator. 

Well, as a judge looking at it, obviously when you lose a case, as you point out, 9–0, it’s a pretty clear signal that the legal position you were advocating was the wrong one. The position the administration took in that case was the same position that the court of appeals had taken. In other words, what the Supreme Court did was reverse the lower court, so—

I’m just explaining why the position we took prior to the decision may have looked different than it did after the decision. 

Well, I certainly accept the decision of the Court, the 9–0 decision, as you say, as a binding precedent of the Court and, again, have no cause or agenda to revisit it or any quarrel with it. The issue, of course, was the one of what remedies are available for an implied cause of action. The reason I think that the lower courts came out the other way and the Supreme Court came out one way is that you’re dealing with an implied cause of action. In other words, it hasn’t been spelled out and— 

I have no quarrel with the Court’s decision, Senator. 

Well, two points, Senator. The issue in the Spending Clause cases that you refer to—Wilder, the later one, the Suter case, and the Gonzaga case that I argued when I was in private practice—the issue is one of congressional intent. The question is: Did Congress intend there to be a private right of action? That’s what the courts are trying to figure out. And if Congress did intend there to be a private right of action, if Congress intended this to be actionable whether through 1983 or under—Section 1983 or under the law itself, then there would be a private right of action. In some cases, Congress doesn’t intend that, and in those cases, there wouldn’t be. I would say—

I was just going to make the point that in those cases, of course, I was advocating a position for a client. I did have occasion as a judge to address a Spending Clause case. It was a case called Barber v. Washington Metropolitan Area— 

Well, it was a 2–1 decision, divided decision on a court that doesn’t often issue 2–1 decisions. There was a lengthy dissent saying that Congress did not have the authority to require the Metro— 

Judge Sentelle dissented. 

Well, the issue is not whether they should be able to sue or not. The issue is whether Congress intended them to be able to sue or not. The issue doesn’t even come up if Congress would simply spell out in the legislation we intended these individuals to have the right to sue in Federal court. That would prevent the issue from even coming up.All of those cases we have been talking about arose because Congress did not address the question, and, therefore, the courts—

Well, if Congress wants them to sue, all Congress has to do is write one sentence saying, ‘‘Individuals harmed by a violation of this statute may bring a right of action in Federal court.’’ There are laws where Congress says that, and that question never comes up.The issue in the various cases that we have been talking about, including in the Barber case, where I ruled that the individual did have the right to sue when I was judge, the issue is, What did Congress intend? And all too often that issue is not even addressed. I don’t know whether it’s because of inadvertence or it’s because of an inability of Congress to agree, and they both sort of—both sides sort of say, well, let’s let the courts figure it out.

Well— 

Yes, I think so. I have often said that a lot of these difficulties, particularly in the area of legal errors being raised and collateral review, a lot of those difficult questions could be avoided if people had competent counsel from the very beginning.

Well, I think the basic instinct and genius behind the Gideon decision was that without counsel to protect people’s rights, they were going to forfeit them. They were going to waive them due to ignorance or inability to appreciate the proceedings, and that is why you need counsel at that stage. It is not simply because you have a right to counsel in the abstract. It was the recognition that having counsel is a way to ensure the protection of your other rights that you may not even be aware of.

Well, I think— 

Senator, that is a very abstract hypothetical. There are situations that arise when an Executive may determine that that type of action is necessary. That may be challenged. I don’t think abstract questions like that should be answered. There have been situations in our past where that authority has been claimed, both abstractly and concretely. Certainly Congress has the power to declare war, but as you know, of course, there have been several incidents in our history, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, others where there has been authorization of the use of force, but not a declaration of war.You know the history, when Madison’s original proposal gave Congress the authority to make war, and he thought that should be changed so that the Executive would have the authority to respond to an invasion, and I appreciate that part of your question.

Well, that’s of course a difficult question. Now, Congress has always exercised the power of the purse with respect to activities of that sort, and regulated the funding for that type of activity, and that has of course always been the core of Congress’s authority. But the question to actually terminate hostilities that the Executive has determined to initiate, either with the authorization of Congress on in the situation of congressional silence or acquiescence, to go back to the Youngstown decision. The issue of what Congress’s authorities are to terminate short of exercising its power with respect to the purse, those are unsettled and I think have to be addressed in the context of a particular case.The memo to which you refer, again, I was a lawyer for the Executive, and any cautious lawyer for the Executive, without regard to the administration, would be alert for any type of suggestion that there are limits on that power, just as—

Well, you know, you take the history anyway, if you have a situation like the Korean War taking place without a declaration of war, the war in Vietnam taking place without a declaration of war, I think it’s difficult to articulate in the abstract where the line would be other than the fact that throughout our history there have been those significant types of engagements that I suspect all of the people involved in them thought were a war that did not have a congressional declaration of war. So again, where the line is drawn or how it would be drawn in a particular case, or even what the role of the courts would be. As you know in these areas there’s often an initial dispute, is this a judiciable question that the Court should entertain in the case of litigation and a conflict between the executive and the legislative concerning something like whether a declaration of war was required. That would be a question the Court would have to address before reaching the merits.

Senator, you said you think this is something most Americans aren’t aware of. I’d suggest probably most judges aren’t aware of it. It is a specialized court. I will tell you when I became aware of it, it’s a surprising institution. It’s an unusual setup.

That was exactly my reaction. On the other hand, Congress, in setting up the court, obviously concluded there were reasons to do it that way. I was asked a question about appointing the judges to it, and my response was that given the unusual nature of it, very unusual nature, given the usual traditions of judicial processes, that the people appointed to it have to be people of the highest quality, undoubted commitment to all the basic principles, both of the need for the court and the need to protect civil liberties. That, I think, is very important.Beyond that I would just tell you I don’t know enough about the operations of the court at this point and how it functions to be able to make any representations about what I would do other than that I certainly appreciate that it’s an unusual establishment and in many respects doesn’t have the sorts of protections that the normal judicial process has, and that I would be sensitive to those concerns.

Certainly, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Good morning, Senator.

Yes. 

Yes, Senator, I do. I’m familiar with the various legislative enactments in the area that protect the right to work and so forth, free from discrimination. 

I do, Senator. Now, there are issues that come up, as you know, in several of the cases before the Supreme Court on the particular applications of that, cases concerning the question of do you have the authority under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to abrogate State sovereign immunity if the claim of disability discrimination concerns a State as a defendant. And as you know, in the Garrett case there was the conclusion that the authority was not there. Later in the Lane case under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the conclusion was that the sufficient record had been established that there was the authority. So while as a general matter, there is the authority in a particular case that may come up against other provisions in the Constitution, or—in that case the recognition of State sovereign immunity, and that presents an issue that the courts have to address. 

Well, it’s certainly the precedent of the Court in that area and I have no quarrel with it. The issue of course is whether or not Congress has the authority under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to abrogate the State’s sovereign immunity. It’s not a policy judgment by the Court about leaving things to the States or the Federal Government, but a legal determination of whether the State’s sovereign immunity has been abrogated. And the Court determined in that case that Congress did have that authority and that it could authorize the suit against the State institution.

I do, I agree with that statement Senator, yes. 

Well, Senator, I think there’s a great deal in my background that you could look to in that respect. For example, you could look to the cases in which I argued in favor of affirmative action. I’ve argued on both sides of that issue. In the Rice v. Cayetano case, for example, before the Supreme Court, I argued in favor of affirmative action for Native Hawaiians. I lost that case but I was arguing on the side of affirmative action.There are other episodes in my background that people could look to. For example, I regularly participate in, when I was at my law firm, a program sponsored by the firm, a legal reasoning program for minority and disadvantaged students going on to law school, to help them prepare for the rigors of law school, so not simply that they would be chosen, selected and admitted into law school, but be in a better position to be able to succeed once they got there.With respect to the FCC case that you mentioned in the Metro Broadcasting case, I think a fuller understanding of the situation there is necessary. The United States had already taken a position before the FCC opposed to the FCC program. That put the Solicitor General’s Office in the position where they had—the position of the United States, which was opposed to it, and the FCC position which had prevailed before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. I authorized the FCC to defend its position in court. That was a discretionary decision. I didn’t have to do that, but I thought the Supreme Court, in a situation where the FCC, part of the United States and the formal position of the United States, before I had ever gotten involved in the case, were at loggerheads, that the Court should have both views and decide the case. They did decide it in favor of the FCC 5–4, and as you noted in the other case that I participated in later, the Supreme Court overturned that decision.The long and short of it is, that if you look at my record on the question of affirmative action, yes, I was in an administration that was opposed to quotas. Opposition to quotas is not the same thing as opposition to affirmative action. That was something that President Reagan emphasized repeatedly. I argued against quotas in theFCC case. I argued in favor of affirmative action in the Hawaiian case. In terms of my own personal involvement, I’ve been active in programs that promote the interests of minorities and disadvantaged to participate fully in our society.

Sure. 

Well, Senator, you have to read the memo I think in its entirety to put it in context. That was not my language. That was the language—the ‘‘un-American’’ reference was the language that was employed by an individual who had a case before the EEOC. He actually won his case before the EEOC, but he didn’t like the difficulty and the time involved. He wrote to the President, and he said two things, one, that his treatment at the hands of the EEOC was un-American, and two, that the President has promised in the campaign to abolish the EEOC, and he wanted to hold the President to that promise. It was my responsibility to figure out how to respond to this complaint that had been received. And how we responded was by protecting that EEOC from interference by the President in any political way, by protecting the EEOC from this sort of complaint. We did not go to the President and say, ‘‘You’ve got to do something about the EEOC.’’ We didn’t pass on the objection at all. And the point of the letter, when you read the whole memorandum, you see two points. The first is that I was unable to determine, in the short time I had to respond, whether or not the President had made such a pledge to abolish to EEOC. I simply didn’t know, and I said that in the paragraph if you read it. And that’s what ‘‘the truth of the matter notwithstanding’’ is referring to, the question of whether or not the President had promised to abolish the EEOC. I say right in the memo that we cannot determine that, and whether his treatment was unAmerican or not is beside the point. We don’t interfere with the ac-tivities of the EEOC. That was the conclusion and that’s what we did in that case.

You do need to read the prior clause, prior sentence. 

Thank you. 

Well, Senator, my point with respect to Chief Justice Warren was that he appreciated the impact that the decision in Brown would have, and he appreciated that the impact would be far more beneficial and favorable and far more effectively implemented with the unanimous Court, the Court speaking with one voice, than a splintered Court. The issue was significant enough that he spent the extra time in the reargument of the case to devote his energies to convincing the other Justices—and obviously, there’s no arm-twisting or any of that. It’s the type of collegial discussion that judges and justices have to engage in of the im-portance of what the Court was doing, and an appreciation of its impact on real people and real lives.I recognize as a judge, and I recognized as a lawyer, that these cases have impact on real people and real lives. I always insisted when I was a lawyer about getting out into the field and seeing it. If I was arguing a case involving Native villages in Alaska, I went to the villages. If I was arguing a case about an assembly line, I went to the assembly line. You had to see where the case was going to have its impact and what its impression was going to be on people.Now, none of those cases were as important as Brown v. Board of Education, but the basic principle is the same. I think judges do have to appreciate that they’re dealing with real people with real cases. We obviously deal with documents and texts, the Constitution, the statutes, the legislative history, and that is where the legal decisions are made, but judges never lose sight, or should never lose sight of the fact that their decisions affect real people with real lives, and I appreciate that.

Thank you, Senator. 

I think the redactions simply identify the individual—the individual who was making the complaint, who had his case. The only thing I would emphasize is that the language that was quoted was part of a sentence, and the question of what ‘‘the truth of the matter’’ is referring to goes to the first part of the sentence that was not read, which is the assertion, the assertion that the President promised to abolish the EEOC. That was the matter that I could not determine in the time available whether that was correct or not, so I said, ‘‘The truth of that matter notwithstanding.’’ And I also emphasized that any reference to the phrase ‘‘un-American’’ is always in quotes to make it clear that that’s what the writer of the letter said, and certainly not what I said, and was certainly not my view then or now. 

Well, I am glad to let the record stand, just so long as the whole memorandum and the entire sentence that is being discussed is in the record. 

I did, Senator, yes. 

Well, Senator, on the underlying question— 

Well, I can say that the—the reason I’m hesitating—and this is what was brought out in the Congressional Research Service memo that you attached to it. These issues come up all the time in related questions. I have no quarrel with the Court’s decision. As you know, it was a 5–4 decision on the legal question, not the question—I certainly believe every child should be educated. 

My own view is that if you have a child, he or she should be educated, and you worry about status later. 

As a personal view, yes. It’s a separate issue as a legal question, as you know. And the Court in Plyler split 5–4. Among the dissenters, the people who agreed with the position thatthe administration—or the position discussed in the memorandum were Justice White and Justice O’Connor. And I would not take their subscribing to the position of the dissent in Plyler v. Doe as suggesting that they in any way have less than fully developed and sensitive concerns about children and education. Justices White and O’Connor don’t, and they’re not subject to criticism on that score simply because their understanding of the law came out in the dissent in Plyler v. Doe.So I would just try to make sure that people appreciate that saying that this is what you think the legal determination was—because the issue there was the Texas Legislature, the representative of the people of Texas, had reached a certain determination about funding and how they wanted to fund particular activities. And that was what the litigation was about. It’s not a question about whether you believe in educating children or not. I don’t think Justice O’Connor didn’t believe that children should be educated, yet she was in the dissent in that case.

I think the conclusion is wrong. I would suggest that any examination of nine cases is too small of a statistical sample to draw any conclusions of that sort. I know that I’ve ruled against corporations on a regular basis on the D.C. Circuit. I think I just saw a study, a more comprehensive one, that suggested I tended to rule against corporations more than the average judge. I don’t want to—I just skimmed the article, but it is quite often the case, for example, a lot of the business on the D.C. Circuit involves regulatory issues, agencies regulating corporations. Are you ruling in favor of the corporation or the agency? And I know I regularly rule in favor of the agency. Sometimes I rule against the agency. I like to think it depends upon the particular law and the par-ticular facts. But I haven’t seen that study, but, again, nine cases, I am sure you could fine nine cases going the other way as well.

Senator, I’m not familiar with the memorandum. If it was withheld, it was probably withheld from me as well, and I don’t recall any involvement. So, you know, I don’t recall any— 

I do know that there was an issue—an issue was raised. I have seen memoranda that I know have been released about private fundraising activities, and I do know that I gave advice in order to make sure that they didn’t engage in lobbying activities in order to be consistent with the Boland amendment. I’ve seen those, but beyond that, I’m not recalling anything. 

You know, it’s not something I’ve—I just sort of know what I’ve read in the papers about it. And, you know, it seemed to me that it did. But, again, that’s just based on—it’s not based on a study or a legal analysis, just sort of—I think a lot of it— 

Well, again, I haven’t done a legal study, but based on what I know, which is just what every citizen knows from reading—I think it all took place after I was no longer in the Government, or at least came to light after that. It seemed to be inconsistent with the law. 

Well, the answer depends, Senator, and this is where you get back to the Youngstown analysis, where Justice Jackson said there are three categories: you can act with Congress’ support, being unclear what Congress’s position is—and he recognized a third category where you can act—the Executive may act in the face of a congressional prohibition. And there are certain areas where the Executive does have authority to the exclusion of Congress. You know, without stating a legal view, for example, one that law professors regularly talk about is the pardon power. In other words, that’s given expressly to the President in the Constitution. And restrictions, if Congress were to pass a restriction on the pardon power, does the President nonetheless have the authority to act under the Constitution? That’s a difficult question. But it may be that the President’s authority would trump Congress’ authority.So I can’t answer a question in the abstract without knowing exactly what the record is and what the situation is. What Justice Jackson said in Youngstown, though, is obviously true, that if the President is acting in the face of congressional opposition, his power is at its lowest ebb. As Jackson put it, it includes his powers less whatever powers Congress has. So if it’s in an area in which Congress has legitimate authority to act, that would restrict the Executive’s authority.

No. 

It was not a dispute about it being the supreme law of the land. There is no dispute about that, that when Congress passes legislation, under the Supremacy Clause it’s the supreme law of the land. The question is what remedies are available. It’s a very simple problem. You folks give money to the States, and you say you can spend this money on educational programs. But if you accept our money, you have to do this, this, and this. 

And the question is, well, what happens if somebody comes into court and says they accepted the money, Congress said if you take our money you have to do this, they didn’t do it, they violated my rights under this provision, what happens then? Now, in many cases, Congress will say if these rights are violated, you can sue in court and you can make that State institution—in this case, not a State institution, a private university. The same thing, they’ve accepted the funds. You can make them pay damages. But in other cases, the argument is, well, the condition was imposed by the Federal Government, and the Federal Government should enforce any violations. And you don’t necessarily have the right to sue for damages. That’s the question.It’s an issue that would never come up if Congress would say in each law if you violate this provision, you can sue in Federal court, or you can’t sue in Federal court. Or as in this case, we are going to set up an office in the Department of Education that is going to police compliance, and if you violate this provision, that office is going to come down on the university and make them comply, make them do whatever they need to do to get back into compliance.There’s no dispute that the university in this case is bound by the condition. The question is: Does an individual who’s harmed by their violation get to sue about it? And sometimes it comes out that they can, as in the Wilder case. Sometimes it comes out that they can’t. The determination is that Congress did not intend there to be a private lawsuit to enforce that. And that was the conclusion in the Gonzaga case.

Well, the answer there is it depends on that law. In Gonzaga what the Court determined was that provision at issue there was not enforceable by private citizens in the courts. It was enforceable by the Federal Government. The Federal Government can cut off the funds. More likely, the Federal Government can enforce the provision through proceedings against the university.In the Wilder case, a different statute, the Court determined the condition in that case, the Medicare—or Medicaid funding case was enforceable, a private citizen could go into court because the review of Congress’ intent in that case came out differently than it did in the Gonzaga case.

It’s always a contract, and sometimes if the intent of Congress is that private parties be allowed to sue, it’s more than a contract. But it’s always at least a contract.

It doesn’t—no, the courts don’t require that. They don’t require that you specifically say you have the right to sue. But the Court has to look at it and try to figure out did you intend—when you put this provision in, did you intend private parties to be able to sue for damages? Or did you expect the Department of Education to enforce that and have the authority to cut off the funds or to impose other conditions because a university is violating it? And as I’ve said, some cases come out one way, and some cases come out the other way. But in each of those cases, what the Court is trying to do is figure out what you, the Congress, meant in that statute. 

Thank you, Senator.

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, I don’t think special interests should be allowed to lobby Federal judges. Stated that way, I think the answer is clear. I don’t know enough about how these things operate. As I said, I have not been on one of them. I don’t know how the funding is set up. I don’t know what the situation is. If confirmed, I’m certainly happy to examine it. I know that there is a conflict of interest or ethical standard review group, I think, within the Judicial Conference. I believe they addressed that question and issued an opinion on it recently. But, again, I am just sort of recollecting something I read. I would say more generally, though—and maybe it is off topic, in which case feel free to cut me off. But I do think it is important for judges and Justices to get out, particularly get out of Washington a little bit. I’ve always enjoyed going to the law schools, participating in the moot courts or, you know, functions where you get to visit with the law students. I’ve done that a few times—not a lot, a few times. I wouldn’t call that by any stretch of the imagination ‘‘a junket.’’ But I do think it’s important for the Justices to getout around the country and particularly visit the law schools. That is probably not the same sort of thing you are talking about.

It may not be good for the game of golf, but... [Laughter.] 

There again, Senator, that’s not an issue I’ve looked at. I know the law prohibits that. I know that there was a case about that, and the Supreme Court decided that, to some extent, that prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to lower-level officials but constitutional as applied to others. It’s not a question that I’ve addressed. 

Well, as you know, the law has changed and evolved dramatically since the early 1980’s, and at least with respect to my personal letter to Judge Friendly—I guess I thought it was a personal letter—[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. But the situation has changed dramatically, as you know. What I was referring to in the early 1980’s was a situation where there were no limits on repetitive habeas corpus petitions, four, five, six, dozens of different petitions could be filed repetitively. Congress saw that as a problem. Congress acted to ad-dress the very concerns that I was raising there in past legislation. The Supreme Court saw it as a problem. The Supreme Court acted in a number of cases, the Teague case and others, in limiting the availability of successive and repetitive habeas petitions.Actually, what happened is the Supreme Court, I think, started down that path, and Congress made the decision that this is something they should look at in a more comprehensive way. So Congress passed laws that restrict when people can file repetitive and successive petitions. Those are the very concerns that I was talking about. They were concerns that had motivated the first person I worked for as a lawyer, Judge Henry Friendly, to write on the subject. He wrote a famous article on habeas reform entitled ‘‘Is Innocence Irrelevant? ’’ because he thought these successive petitions had made sort of a game out of the whole process in which the question of innocence was totally lost in these successive petitions.And the references to the Great Writ, yes, of course, the writ of habeas corpus has an established heritage as a basis for complaining about illegal confinement. But all the stuff we are talking about there—the fourth and fifth successive petitions, raising new issues that should have been raised in the first petition—and as you know, that’s what Congress’ legislation focused on.

No. The purpose of what I was saying was to certainly reform and abolish the system as it existed then, where people could file repetitive and successive petitions, and I’ll tell you why. The main problem—and I think it’s a particular concern in death cases—is that nobody along the way feels that they’re making the responsible decision. If people get in a situation where they know, okay, if you’re on a jury and you sentence someone to death, if you think, well, he’s going to file habeas petitions in State court, and they’re going to look at it then, after that—and the person who considers the State habeas petition says, ‘‘I know there are going to be successive Federal habeas petitions, they’ll look at the issue then,’’ everybody is pointing fingers in opposite directions.When Congress reformed this system, I think it helped to make clear that the decisions that are going to be made on the first habeas petition are going to be critical, and so hopefully it’s looked at a lot more carefully than in the prior system when you knew, well, that wasn’t the end of the process, it wasn’t even the beginning of the end; the conviction was just the end of the beginning.

Well, that wasn’t my position. 

No, my— 

Oh, I’m not in favor now and was not in favor then of not allowing any Federal habeas review.

Yes. 

Well, they certainly wouldn’t have been able to assert their claim of innocence in Federal habeas— 

I don’t think using opinion-writing assignments as a way to try to promote a particular view or agenda is a good idea. And I don’t think Chief Justice Rehnquist did that. I do think if you go back and look at every year that he was the Chief Justice and just pick out what you think are the 10 or 12 biggest cases of that year, I think you will find that those cases are distributed very evenly among the nine Justices. And one reason I think relations among the Justices were so collegial under Chief Justice Rehnquist’s leadership—at a time when, of course, the Court had very marked philosophical differences and sharp dissents in some areas, but everybody got along well—is because the Chief made a priority of being fair in his opinion assignments. I think that is the more important priority. 

No, I don’t, in answer to both questions.

I wouldn’t do that. I think that, again, sort of trying to use that assignment power in a tactical way, it causes tension on the Court and I think undermines the ability of the Chief Justice, to the extent he has that ability—and it’s obviously limited—to act as a force to help bring about some cohesiveness and collegiality. 

No. 

I’m going to disagree with your premise. I’ve represented plaintiffs’ interests. I think if you look, for example, at the antitrust cases I’ve argued, more of them have been on the plaintiff side than on the defendant side. One of my co-clerks, when I clerked for Justice Rehnquist, is a very prominent personal injury lawyer, and I think he does a wonderful job. I know there are abuses in this area. There are abuses in the area of defense representation as well. I certainly don’t have any biases one way or the other. 

The Act contains a definition of disability, and that’s what the issue was about, and that definition does not contain that type of restriction. So, you know, I don’t want to comment on issues that might come before me, but the case was about the definition. The definition was not restricted in that way. The only point I would make—and I’m sure you appreciate this— is that a lot of times the statements during oral argument are certainly not expressions of either the Justices’ view—they’re often playing a devil’s advocate, and I don’t even remember that question. I don’t know if it was directed at me or the other counsel, but it may well have been intended to elicit a response to flesh out more fully what the definition was.

Well, I have to say I think it should be interpreted consistent with Congress’s intent, and you look at a lot of different factors in trying to flesh that out.If you folks here in Congress had a particular—in any statute, a narrow focus, then to give that focus a broader impact I think would be wrong. If you had a broad focus, as, of course, you often do when you’re dealing with statutes designed to address discrimination, giving that interpretation a narrow focus would be wrong.The effort in every case is to try to give it the right focus, and that’s the focus that you intended when you passed the law.

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, no, Senator, and I did try to be very careful in separating the personal views with respect to the importance of education from the legal question there. And the legal question, of course, was a close one. It divided the Court 5–4, and as I noted, among the dissenters were Justices White and O’Connor. And I don’t think their legal position reflected any less than wholehearted view concerning the importance of education. 

Well, it depends how many there are. [Laughter.]Judge ROBERTS. My answers will be fuller the fewer questions there are, but I will certainly—[Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I will certainly obviously make every effort to get them in as soon as possible. 

Senator, I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to take a position. If the client is asserting a privilege, I don’t think the attorney should be stating a position on it, because in these situations the privilege is that of the client. And for the attorney to take a position would, could, might put pressure on the client and— 

Well, when the memos were prepared, I was the attorney. 

And they were the client. 

I don’t think it’s appropriate for a lawyer to do so. 

I’d begin by saying, ‘‘Well, that’s a good question, Senator.’’ [Laughter.] Judge ROBERTS. I think, with respect, I would ask a lot of the questions that have been asked, a lot of the questions that were asked in the questionnaire that I completed earlier, and it beginswith the most important question, What is your view of the proper role of a judge in our system? And people have different answers to that question. I’ve given an answer to that question.How do you approach particular cases in areas of particular interest? And I’ve been asked that question and I’ve given an answer. I’ve explained, for example, in the area of Executive power, as issues arise what the framework that I would use would be, and I’ve talked about the Youngstown opinion and Justice Jackson’s framework there.I’ve talked about how I would approach cases involving the right to privacy under the Liberty Clause. I’ve talked about how I would approach cases involving Government enforcement in the antitrust—

But in other areas people talk about—and it is personal views on issues, and there again, I think it is important. There may be some nominees who want to share personal views on issues. My reaction has been to emphasize—and I think this tells you about what kind of a judge I hope I am on the Court of Appeals and what kind of a Justice I would be if confirmed, and my reaction has been that I set those personal views aside, and so don’t consider them pertinent. Other nominees might take a different approach in response to those types of questions.People have asked about particular decisions, and I’ve talked about decisions in which I’ve been involved. We’ve talked about— with Senator Grassley about the Totten case in which I was involved, others about the Barber case involving Congress’s power under the Spending Clause.People have asked very probing questions about my legal positions. What did you—what was the position you were advocating in this case and why? I think it’s fair to talk about the record.

There have been a lot of questions asked and a lot answered. I can’t think of any that—you know, I expected people to ask me about this and it hasn’t been asked.

I think the Committee has been very effective over the last several days in learning a lot about me. I think in the process of meeting with the Senators before—and I was quite serious when I said I appreciated how accommodating everyone had been in sitting down with me. I think people learned a lot about me. I think you can learn a lot about me from looking at the 50 opinions I’ve written. You can learn about—

If the question—and this is where the issue comes up—is whether or not as the Court has addressed it, the ac-tivities are commercial. If the activities are commercial in nature, you get to aggregate them under Wickard v. Filburn that we have talked about. You do not have to look at just that particular activity. You look at the activity in general. Where the dispute and issues come in is whether the activities are commercial. That is where the disagreement—the point I was trying to make in the infamous or famous toad case. If you should look at this as commercial activity, then you can—

I do, Senator, and I think that is the basic theme that runs through the Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence. There is again of course the Lopez and Morrison decisions, but there is also the Raiche decision, and again I think it is very important to—and what the Raiche decision said is you’ve got to consider Lopez and Morrison in the context of this broad sweep, not just as sort of the only decisions.

I appreciate it’s a hypothetical and you will as well, so I don’t mean to be giving binding opinions. But it would seem to me that Congress can make a determination that this is an activity, if allowed to be pursued, that is going to have effects on interstate commerce. Obviously, if you were successful in cloning an animal, that’s not going to be simply a local phenomenon, that’s going to be something people are going to—

Well, I appreciate the comments very much, Senator Schumer, and I very much appreciate the pro side of the ledger. On the con side, the issue of documents, it is hard for me to comprehend that there could be more documents. The numbers been ranging from 80,000 to 100,000, and there is a lot of paper out there. I have tried to be as fully responsive as I thought consistent with my obligations as a sitting judge and a nominee. And I appreciate that this is not a new issue. You have gone back and read the transcripts and of course participated. I have gone back and read the transcripts. It comes up at every nomination. In some instances Members of the Committee want more information than the nominee feels that he or she can give in good conscience. That is nothing new. I have tried to be as fully expansive as I can be, and drawn the line where as a practical matter I think it is necessary and appropriate. The basic question, Senator Feinstein and Senator Schumer, what kind of a Justice would I be? That is the judgment you have to make. I would begin, I think, if I were in your shoes, with what kind of a judge I have been. I appreciate that it has only been a little more than 2 years, but you do have 50 opinions. You can look at those. And, Senator Schumer, I don’t think you can read those opinions and say that these are the opinions of an ideologue. You may think they’re not enough. You may think you need more of a sample. That is your judgment. But I think if you’ve looked at what I’ve done since I took the judicial oath, that should convince you that I’m not an ideologue, and you and I agree that that’s not the sort of person we want on the Supreme Court. Beyond that I have the few days that I’ve been here, all the documents, the questionnaire. You have not just my opinions but my briefs. I think those also help show what kind of a judge I would be. You of course appreciate that that’s presenting a position and I’m just an advocate, but advocates deal with the law in different ways. You can look at other people’s briefs, I think, and conclude that that person may not be a good judge because of the way they argue the law. I would hope you would look at my briefs and my arguments before the Supreme Court and conclude that that’s a person who respects the law, respects the Court before whom he is arguing, and will approach the law in a similar way as a judge. 

Well, I mean certainly the basic attorney/client privilege goes back centuries, and there have been eloquent expressions of its value in the Supreme Court. I think of the Upjohn opinion from 1981 in the Supreme Court and other classic expressions. And the idea is that if we want people to benefit from the advice that lawyers can give, we have to ensure that they feel perfectly free to communicate and exchange their views with their lawyer without fear that that would be reviewed and used to their prejudice.Carried forward to the point that we are talking about now, you have to have a candid exchange among lawyers in presenting cases to the Court in order to effectively represent your client whether your client is the Government of the United States or a private company. And that type of debate, which often involves pointing out inconsistencies in the decision, even flaws in your own legal position, say, ‘‘This is the argument, but this part of the argument is really quite weak and we have to be worried about that.’’ Those sorts of things you do need to thrash out and discuss and elaborate on. And yet if that was then revealed to your adversary or to the Court, it would obviously prejudice the presentation.And if those things were going to be regularly revealed, people wouldn’t make those types of analyses and judgments. They wouldn’t say, ‘‘This is a weak argument. What are we going to do about that? Should we really make that argument? ’’ They would not commit those to writing and the adequacy of the legal counsel and advice would suffer, and the role of the advocate before the court in vindicating the rule of law on which the courts rely, would also suffer.

The first part of the sentence refers to that assertion, and that assertion was the assertion that President Reagan had promised to abolish the EEOC. That as the issue that I said in the memorandum I had been unable to determine whether that was accurate or not. It was the truth of that matter, of that assertion that I couldn’t verify. The reference to ‘‘un-American’’ was not my language. It was the language of the person who complained and said, ‘‘You need to do something about the EEOC,’’ and our response was what we’re going to do is make sure that the EEOC is not interfered with because of your complaints. Now, he may have felt that he was being treated in an ‘‘unAmerican’’ way and wanted something done about it. But it was not my view, and again, the language was in quotes to make clear that it wasn’t my view. 

It’s a hypothetical question. Of course, I think I probably would have, Senator. I actually have done pro bono assistance for States on a regular basis through the National Association of Attorneys General, and if I’m remembering right, the State would have been the other party in that case. I think that’s right. And through the State and Legal Center, I participate in moot courts for the States on a regular basis. And a big part of my practice was representing States, so if a State, in that case, Colorado, had come to me and said, ‘‘We have a case in the Supreme Court, would you defend it? ’’ I might—again, I can’t answer without knowing the full details and all that, and I have to look at the legal issues. And I would not, and never have, presented legal arguments that I thought were not reasonable arguments, doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to prevail, and I have certainly lost my share of cases.But it has not been my general view that I sit in judgment on clients when they come to me. I viewed that as the job of the Court when I was a lawyer. And just as someone once said, you know, it’s the guilty people who really need a good lawyer, I also view that I don’t evaluate whether I as a judge would agree with a particular position when somebody comes to me for what I did, which was provide legal advice and assistance, particularly before the Supreme Court.

Well, let me try to answer it this way, Senator. People become lawyers for different reasons, all perfectly good and noble, and legitimate. People who are interested, for example, in protecting the environment often will go into the law and practice environmental law because they think that is an effective way to advance a cause in which they passionately believe.People who are committed to the cause of civil rights may become lawyers and become civil rights lawyers and present and press those causes because they are causes in which they passionately believe.I became a lawyer or at least developed as a lawyer because I believe in the rule of law. The point I was trying to emphasize in my opening statement, that all of these other areas—you believe in civil rights, you believe in environmental protection, whatever the area might be, believe in rights for the disabled, you’re not going to be able or effectively to vindicate those rights if you don’t have a place that you can go where you know you’re going to get a decision based on the rule of law. It was the point I was making with respect to the Soviet Constitution, filled with wonderful-sounding rights, absolutely meaningless, because people who suffered under that system had no place they could go in court and say, ‘‘My rights have been violated.’’ So that’s why I became a lawyer, to promote and vindicate the rule of law.Now, that means that that’s at issue and play regardless of what the cause is, and that’s why, as we were talking yesterday, you can go in my record and you’ll see, yes, I’ve advanced cases promoting the cause of the environment. As I was discussing earlier, I’ve been on both sides of the affirmative action issue. Take even technical areas like antitrust. I’ve defended corporations; I’ve sued corporations. In each case, I appreciated that what I was doing as a lawyer, particularly as a lawyer before the Supreme Court, was promoting the rule of law in our adversary system. And I viewed that as—I appreciate that to some they may say, well, that sounds like you’re a hired gun, to be disparaging, you are going to take the sideof whoever comes in the door first. I think that’s a disparaging way to capture what is, in fact, an ennobling truth about our legal system that lawyers serve the rule of law, above and beyond representing particular clients. That’s why when the Chief Justice welcomes new members to the Supreme Court bar, he welcomes them as members of the bar and as officers of the court, because that is the important role that they play. That has significance for what types of arguments they can present and how they can present them.

Well, and the—I had someone ask me in this process—I don’t remember who it was, but somebody asked me, you know, ‘‘Are you going to be on the side of the little guy? ’’ And you obviously want to give an immediate answer, but as you reflect on it, if the Constitution says that the little guy should win, the little guy is going to win in court before me. But if the Constitution says that the big guy should win, well, then, the big guy is going to win, because my obligation is to the Constitution. That’s the oath. The oath that a judge takes is not that I will look out for particular interests, I’ll be on the side of particular interests. The oath is to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that’s what I would do.

Absolutely, and it is, again, what’s carved above the doors to the Supreme Court: ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ And the judicial oath talks about doing justice without regard to per-sons, to rich and to poor. And that, of course, is critically important. You do have to appreciate that there are going to be interests who, for one reason or another, don’t have the same resources as people on the other side. The idea is not to give the case to the side with the best resources, the side with the best lawyers, the side with the most opportunity to prepare and present. It is to decide the case according to the law and according to the Constitution. And as case after case in the Supreme Court shows, that’s often the prisoner who’s sitting in his cell and writes his petition out longhand. Sometimes the Constitution is on that person’s side and not on the side of the corporation with the fancy printed brief. But the judge’s obligation is to appreciate that the rule of law requires that both of those be treated equally under the law.

Thank you, Senator.
