Senator Ervin, I think that. is a very definite, easily understood stateiient. It is one which for me is tli startingpoint. of constittional interpretation and construction. Mr. Chief Justice Ma-shll's statements, of course, almost, deserve an attitude of sanctity. But I certainly would assume that the Constitution means what,it,says.Senator Envi,. I will ask you if you agie with me that the-reason the Constitution has been able to endure so well arises out, of the factthat-the grants of the power which the Constitution makes extends int 6the future?Judge BILAC.KMXu. This is the way it has to be, Senator, anit this is what occasions now and then amendments to the Constitiition to meet new needs that, were not, foreseen years ago.Senator Envix. Chief "Justice Marshall also stated in subs:tnce in probably his greatest. opihion, Marbury versus Madison, after poilt big out, that the Constitution reqitires each Sipreie Court. Justice to take an oath to sfpp6rt it, that.'this oath iliposes upon the Supreme Court. Justice the obligation to accept the Constititibn as a rule for the governing of his official actions. I would like to have your comments on that statement.Judge BLACkMxN. Of course, Senator Ervin, 10, going on'tt years ago, I took that rather awesome oath. It, was administered to me by Judge John B. Sanboan, a man whom I revere in-memory. I know7 what. he thought of liat. oath and I hope that I have been able to fulfill ilsobligations in inuch'the same measure as he did.I wild regard any new oath which were to come ny way as one deserving the same seriousness of attention and obligation as before. So, mly answer to you is defliitcly in' the affirmative.

Of course, times are different in f9701h'liki they wiere 200 yers-'ago. No I~ob of iHien 200 years ago could deterMdhe what ouri)loblems are today. That is, I sUl')pose, what we have courts for, Federal courts for, to c€oni'tue the Constitufiimffin 'the light of current l)roblems. But I think as a beghiin1ng point tite Founding IiPthers must have intended what. they said.Senator IltAr. But that document frequently, I suppose, occasionally certainly, does not specifically address itself 'to tile concrete quetion that is brought, before the court. Do you agree that" tie work of a member of the Snprenie Court: by its very nature requires sofih6 inter-pretation beyond the words o the Constittu{ioniihd tfiminlterpretation requires an understindIjig of the contemporary society which gives rise to1the concrete problem that is presented?JIdge BL.ACK UN. Of course, Lthiink this is saying the same thingperhaps in better language than I was able to produce. Phis again is why we have courts. Conditions are different today ihan they were even 10 years ago. I see this in cases that. come to us. Thisis one reason the Constitution has endured, that it is in a way a rigid instrument and ina way a very flexible one. We search for its meaning. Sometimes it,is easy, somet imes it is very, %'erdiicuilt.

These are the rules by which we all try to live together.Senator B.ir. I concur. Although precedent is strong, nevertheless it is not the kind of think we worship and I appreciate your explaining that.In a New York Times article of April 20th, T think it was, you were quoted as saying maw is a social I)eing an(l law is in part social. I supposo this is in line With your answer to Senator Keniiedy, in1i'!rd to looking at the whole picitreanfd recognizing that times change?Judge BiLW('KMUN. Well, despite the fact, that the press was on me at a very climatic, critical moment of my life, and I hardly know what I said, I think I w6ild agree with that statement Still.Senator fltxii. Would you care to offer an observation-this goes to the point raised by Senator Kennedy in the speech lie made last evening. One of the news media con(lcted a poll on the il|l of Rights and between two-thirds and three-fourths of the people who were ppoolrlteiodnrseospf oflnuedeB(itlhl aotf tRheilyhtsv.oWuldounlodt lyoooukcwariethtodicsofmavmoernotnonretpheealrionlge of those amendments?Judge BIACKMU.. 11ell, I doubt if it is appropriate for a Federal it[degree tthoeycoamremaenndt. tohneythairse.vTehreysmpreacrieouthsetotmooel.s with which we work.This is more of a political problem for which you, Senator Bayh, are better trained than I ever could be. As long as that Bill of Pights is there, this is--well, I accept it and I am not qualifled to state that .... cemrai inficpeonrttiionnsstroiffieitnto.u. ght, to be changed or repealed. I think it is aSenator B.v-I. Well, I an not surprised to get. this response but, I think it. is important for us not to ignore the opportunity we have on occasions such as this to say to some of our citizens who might be swayed by teml)orar passions or emotions thatr they are treading oil very thin*ice if they getyinvolved in tampering with those freedoms, thole rights that have been so important to us.Let. tie, if I may, get, into another area that I am sure will come as no surprise to you, an area that,has been the subject.of some discussion and concern in regard to one of the previous nominations, this whole business of ethical standards and conflict of interest..I have expressed publicly and I express to you, sir, a great, reluctance as a himnan being to ju(lge another human being. Our system calls for somei of us to Ju(ge others. We may or may not, like it; but if we are participating iln carrying forth our responsibilities we must, accept this.You have had a distinguished role in judging. Certainly those of us on the Senate .h(licdiary Committee are cAlled to jtllge the competence and qualifications of others as we do our duty.I think particularly today, and I notice you stress this, with the changing times tile p ol)le are looking at. our system, are asking us topay more attention, to examine more closely somne of the things which we may have passed off, not intentionally, biut rather cavalierly before, and it is because of this continuing concern that. I have, that. I wait to pose some questions, if I may, sir, to you relative to financial interest.Is ita,ccurate'to suggest that the information which was included in response to Senator Eastland's questions covered all of tie.outside income and all of the financial interest,that.you have held while you have been on the bench? The material provided to us by the Justice Depart.ment and incoi-porated in Mr. Kleindienst.'s letter]Judge lBr,ACK.%tUN-. This is correct., sir. 

Theanswer to that,iscorrect. Senator Rml . Now, there has been some notice in the newspapers in read to a few cases in which you (lid sit and you (idat the s"ame time have fiincial interests in one of the parties. It was as I recall, a relatively insignificant interest, iut that you did in fact sit on some of these cases. I know that it has been some time since 196) and I (to not want to ask questions unless yoiur memory has been- prol)erly refieshed, but it has been brought to my attention that (lie cases of Ihinson v. Forld Motor Co. in 1960. Koutula v. Ford Motor Co. in 1961, Mahoney v.N houM'estern Bell Telephone Co., and Jlinm.,otaMhd ng v. ,Superior1nsvulating Tape, were four cases in which you did own some stock in one of the corporations involved. Is that accurate?44-228 0-70----4Judge Bj,,ickiJN. It. is accurate as to the first three. The fouti-h case is one ithht I dug up in my search last week.

'If you feel, as a judge who will be siltlhg on the Supreme Court, hat Ihis would piut you in an adverse position, then I certainly will acceptyour re fusal to comment. Those are, to your judgment, the only four cases that ,ou were in t)nyway involved w'ith financiall that caine before ,,6u? .Judge BiAACK(1,,. I certainly have'tried hard to review the over900 cases with which I have had something to do in my lphus Years. These are the oily four that I have uncovered. 'I'wo of them" were adverse toonijy so-called interests. Two were the other way. The thurd one, the NortItwestern'el, of course, was a step removed because I assume Northvestern Bell is a controlled subsidiarv of A.T & T.It. was a foolish little case anyway, shouldnever have-been In Federal coui't. There was not any qiuestion of the decision. There was no real problem to it. But;those are the only ones, Senator Bayh.Senator ,,viu. I Understand that there was one othemar, lhrhgenan v. (GatewayFord Truck Sales this year, in which you removed yourself from,thecase, i§ that.accurate?Judge BL.ACKMI.v. This is correct. Sciator BAYL. Now, in these, cases that you did have the relatively insignificant, financial interest in, did any of them involve! a major legal issue or social issue that had an impact on the company or theindustry involved or was the impact of the case confined to the amount of money involved In the immediate case?'Judge BlTACKMiU. I thini the answer to that is (lefiuitely the latter. The Hanson case was an alleged-was a situiat ion of alleged fraidulent representations made to a prospective dealer. ThemKofila case was a case under the Automobile I)ealers Franchise Act: for an alleged wronifIi termination of a particularr dealership in Mifinesota. The A'orthwestern Bell case, I cannot even tell you the merits because we never got to the merits. It was a l)rocedural' issue. It was not very im-iortnt. Obviously there was not a great deal that was requested. The ,lfilnesotaMiing case was a typical patent action institutedby 3 for patent. hfrIngelient. We held for the--we granted tile defendant's motion for summary jdgment. That, too, was a procediU';I matter,I think cleai'lv none of these involved any social issues and nothing more than-nole of then was more than a private controversy betweell the iiiti eC t6 tbe lit igati6n.Senator Bl;n. The"Alooy one that I cnin see i'ny possible broader implication in would be the Kotula case, where you 11ve the conflict bet Ween'the dealer and"the motor comlany, Ford Motor Co. itself. Would there have been any possibility ti~l if the courthaid ruled favorably for the dealer inthat 'ease thatitlis night.live~rrimlted other dealers to bring cases elsewhere outside of this ihiiftdlite case?Judge BA.%CK'MUJN.

Tie wills were drawn before I went on the belch. In two of them, the deaths took place after I was on the bench. Senator Bni. Thank you, Judge. Tho CHAIIRIMAN. We will recess ftil 2 :30.

Senator By-rd I am too much a product, of that. same kind of thing to disagve'with your comment. I dislike to talk about. it, but I did not have -re]y much to start with either, and this is the only system I have ever known. It has been good to me. I do notknow o'f a better onie. I apologize for tie Ipesonal reference to that extent, but of courseone has a lot of luck on the way. I do not know where else in this world of ours-luck is readily a ailable to one who is ready for it, Iguess. Senator Bvi)m. I thank you, Judge Mlackmun, for thlft response. Iapologize likewise for the'personal preference. But what. I said I said most. respectfilly. I realizetliere are those who see things one way. I mav see things another way. '1They have a right, to express their views and'I have. a right to express mine. They Iave. done so, and I have done so. I just want (he record to show, as far as Iram concerned, I al proud of the system, I have much to be grateful for, and I can attribute much to the kind of system we have. I think I speak for many Americans-including young people--in saying this.Judge BLAVK.UN. I canl fully undlerstand, sir, your pride in this young man. I hope one day to b able to say tie same thing about my sons-mn-law. Tlhey are working at it.Senator Byhi). Mr. Chairman, on the basis of my own investigations, I am satisfied as to tle integrity of the nominee and his ability, as well as with the correctness ot his philosophy concerning tile Droper funct ions of Supreme (oilrt Just ices.His opinions appear to*reflect. pidicial1 restraint, a clear resl)ect for judicial l)recedent. an( a recognition of the constitutional (lemarcation of authority between time judicial and the legislative bramiphes.His opinions also reflect, I believe, a proper es)ect for that. line of demarcation, anlI believe, therefore, that. we can correctly assume and hope that, in his future actions in tie high office to W'hich he has beei niomniinated lie will netcontribute to a further usurtiomi of the fulictcns of the legislative branch. I, therefore, coi'liiinent ,Julge Blackmnm on his record, on his nomination, and oil his al)pear-ane before this committee, and I expect to sti)port the nomination. The CImut.%x. Senator Iruska ? Senator I hir-KA. Mr. Chairman, the nominee before us isno shragerto this room. lie sat, here 11 years ago in the same position-it may evell have beemi the same clhir-when this committee conducted its hearing into his qualifications for tie, judgeship in the Eighth Circuit (Coutof ApI)peals. It was this Senator who presided o'Ver fhat heariimg, and I recall it. with a great, deal of pleasure. It was a real honor tohave served in that capacity in lieu of the chairman who was absent.on official business.There is another reason why Judge Blackmun (toes not sit. hereas a stranger to me. Nebraska is in the eighth circuit, and of themany judges whose work I have followed Since becoming a memberof this committee I have observed .Judge Blackmun's decisions and hisactions a little closer than most because of the relationship betweenNebraska and tle eighth circuit.I have read many of his decisions and I am in frequent. contactwith some of his felow judges, notably the two who live in my homecity, former chief judge of the eight circuit, Harvey Johnsen, andDon Lay. I)on Lay, I note, when lie was approved by'the Senate wasconfirmed at an earlier age than most of the cireut or the districtcourt judges on the bench today. Judge Richard Robinson, the districtcourt, judge in Oniaha, was especially laudatory in a recent conversa-tion about the part that. the judge lclays and w.orks-at. in his l)resentofficial capacity. Judge Van Pelt, in Lincoln, only 50 miles; away,feels much the same.There is no better way to judge a. man than by his work andltheappraisal of those who have worked with him in the same business.That, of course, is tihe profession of law and -the administration of acourt. of justice.MAy own personal survey demonstrates to me that this nominee Mr.Chairman, is held in the highest regard by his contemporaries at thebar"and on the bench. This attitude is widespread and it. should not.be a source of sirlprise.I join with my colleagues in commending the American Bar As-sociat ion for the-ethpeoyrt have ren(ier d in this I)articilar instance.It is a new system, a new approach, I think l)erhaps morm detailed andin greater depth than before, and it. has been reported in splendidshape.This committee has never abdicated its responsibility in favor ofthe American Bar Association or the Judicial Conference, or anyother bo)dy, in(lividual, or group. We like to get advice from them,but of course we have to use our own judgment in making our finaldecision.But I want. to say that it is comforting to get men like those whoare serving with Jidlge Walsh on the Federal jtidiciaiy, the Com-mittee on Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Assciation, andhave them give their opinion as they have. It. is comforting and it, isof very high value.So I commend the American Bar Association for its willingness tohave joined in this effort, and I commend them particularly for re-serving the ol)portulnit.y to sui)plemenit. their report. after these hear-ings are completed so that they will be able to make a final judlgmenton tie. basis of the sme material and evidence which is before thiscommittee.ow, Judge Bhackmun, luring the hearing this morning yo, wereasked certain questions designed to elicit your awareness and your co-cern about certain social problems, and other maladjustmelnts in oursociety. I thought your answer to that question was very forthright miidvery good. I recall that you indicated you were aware itfhem andtlatyol had concern for them. Isn't iftr-ite however, that there will be adifferent response from different l)eople in regard to such a concern?Institutions under our constitutions perform ditl'ereit fun6tions insolving these social ills. Not all are given the sime power. Isn't ittrue, Judge llackimun, that a Supreme Court and the membersthereof are bound pretty much by the record of the case before themand by the ('onstiffiti;4I of the United States. h'lhey cannot andshould not. venture beyond the record and beyond the Constitutionor beyond the state of the law anid violate and distortt the Constitutionin all etort to try to achieve an alleviation of celfain well-known evils.The same woul(l be. true of people ini a legislative field such as themembers of this committee. We have our limitations. We can legis-late to be sure, but it. is always.sub'ect to the. limitations p)laccd on usby the Constitution and of course by the courts.Now, I can understand how one would be concerned with the socialand the economic proIblels, and yet, at tile same time just. becausethere is an awareness then and a great concern about it does not indi-cate. (toes it, that he can (to almost anything and everything to try torect i fy those. problemss ?Judge BlACKMUN. Senator l ruska, I think there were several ques-tions there. As I went. along of course the answer to all except. the lastis in the definite affirmative. I strongly believe in olr system of checksand balances and in our three-branch system of government. As youpoint out, the Constitution in Federal cases is always part of the record. I firmly believe in deciding cases on the record. I hllope I havenever done therwise.I firmly believe that change, if change comes, must come within theframework of tie law as we understand it. And not outside the law.Now, the very last. part of your statement has escaped me because Ith;nk the answer to th at was in the negative.Could I ask you to repeat that last part,?Senatim IitusKi,. It had to (to with tihe power of public officials to (tosomething about, any concern that they might have about the inade-quacy of our present system and the shortcomings and tile threats toits liberties.Judge Br..%cKmux. I think I have already answered that.Senator IflURSK.. I think so.Judge BlACK.AmN. Each of the three parts has its own sphere, andeach is limited by' the Constitution. Together we survive., I think. AndI a1 a firm believer in this tripartite system of government that hasblessed us over the many years.

This is the chronology after the Pope case. ThePope case, of coumse, was a very celebrated case out i our part of the Country. This was a young nmn graduated with hionors from his college oni Sunday and onl Fridlay comitted these Ohies. Ini a, Iater case of Mfaxrweli v. Stephens and a still later case of Afaxiell v. Bishop which is now before the Supreme Court. of tile United States wewere also coitfronted with tihe issue of capital punishment. In ail bf those cases the eighth atiiendnent argument. was made. In each and aarlgl uomt tehnots. e cases we upheld tie penalty against the eighth amendment.In the Iast. one, ill Maxiwell v. Bishop, I made the gintuitous observation which has caused so much furor, that, it, was particularly excruciating for one who is iot. convinced of the rightness of capitalil)unIs'luent as a deterrent in crime, This, Senator Fong, is a lorsonlt conclusion on my part. It. is a part. of personal philosophy. I think time other question of the rightness of legislation, be it by a State legislature,, or by Congress in dealing with Federal crimes, to impose the death penalty is an entirely different, question. It hap-pens that I grew up in a State, Minnesota, whieh" has not had tile death peniaty since 1911. in miy entire lifetime within fl y memory it, has not been an issue. And when I came on the court. there were immediately three or four instances where we were asked to stay executions scheduled for the next. (lay. In none of those cases did we enter a stay order. In each of them as I recall the eighth amendment issue was raised.And I stated in connection with the observation which the press has latched onto, I think I can quote it verbatim. I also stated that ordinarily the imposition of the death penalty is a matter for the discretion of the legislature. I firmly believe this. One of course cin imagine if a Legislature were to Impose the death penalty on a pedestrian for crossing the street, against, a red light this mlght be something else again.Senator FoNo. That would be very unreasonable?,Judge B1.ACKM3UTN. Sir?Senator FoNo. Th at. would be very unreasonable? Judge,BLACKMU.N. I would think so.Senator Foxo. Yes.,Judge BAcK.. But my other observation to which vou nihke reference about. the tree justices, this is the case of Ritdolph v. Alabama, certiorari denied, with three justices in dissent, statingthat they would like to hear argument on the issue whether the i]-position'of tile death penalty for the crime of rape where the vi im is not, harmed would be in "violation of the eighth amendment. Forme this is not. really a very difficult, matter in the context of our cases because in every one of them the victim was not. left unharmed. And so even inlthe -view of the three dissenting justices, it seemed to me there was no real problem. I merely sensed in Rudolph. v. Alabama,the first. instance in recent years 'in any event, of justices of the Supreme Court being concerned basically with file eighth amendment. argument. It has caused me no problem personMly, My personal feeling about. it. is on one side, it could change tomorrow.My attitude toward eilelegislative aspect is another thing. I have stated what my initial approach to it is, and certainly I would never want to decide that question without its being frequently briefed and adequately argued.Senator FoNo. So you feel that, at tile present. time there really is not definitive attitude as far as you are concerned, no very definite attitude that capital punishment should be abolished?Judge BACK'mux. This is my personal philosophy. If I were legislator and it, came up, probably this is the vay I wV'ould initially feel depending in -ari't oil any overwhelmiig Attiuide on tile part of -myconstituents. But. otherwise, apart from that, I start. witllt e premise that tilis is basically a legislative discretioiiary matterSenator Fo.o. Anid if tile Legislature says tilat capital punishment should be imposed you would follow tIat?'Judge BiACrt;x. Certainly, with anl exception perhaps in mIy pe-destrian illustration. Senator Foxo. Yes. I can understand. Many people feel that withtle abolition of capital lIunisiment, for example, a convict i i'thme penitentiary may continue to kill, and there have been cases in many jurisdictions in which a convict has killed other convicts in the pei-tentiary knowing that he will not be subjected to capital punishment. Would you like to comment onthat?Judge BLACKMUN. Yes, indeed. We have had similar cases rise in our circuit, and I have learned how explosive this issue is in the-public mind the last few weeks. I am not a. legislator.Well, I have stated my attitude toward it. I respect" the legislative mind, and this is where I start, and I-think probably that is where I finish.Senator FoNo. Well, I am satisfied with your answer to my question. Thank you. And in conjunction with my "colleague, Senator iruska, you can count, on two-seventeenths now rather than one-seventeenth.Judge BLACK3[uN. Thank you, Senator.
