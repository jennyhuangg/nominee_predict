No, I believe it is correct.

I think it is clear under the Constitution that legislative power is not vested in the Supreme Court. It is vested in the Congress; and I feel the major instrument for changing the laws in this country is the Congress of the United States. The business of the Congress is that of changing the law. That is your entire business,maybe not the entire business but certainly the better part of yourNOMINATION OF BYRON R. WHITEbusiness, and many of the cases, especially those of constitutional law that have come before the Court, have been precipitated because theCongress of the United States has itself interpreted the Constitution, implicitly or impliedly by virtue of passing a law.A case comes up in the Supreme Court many times because Congress has itself interpreted the law, as it must do in enacting legislation. The Executive many times must face up to constitutional questions and some of those are presented to the Supreme Court. And many times either the Executivxe or Congress will take an action which involves a constitutional question which never gets to the Supreme Court at all. No one ever questions it. Certainly the last word is the Supreme Court if the matter comes to the Court, unless there is consti-tutional amendment or unless Congress determined that it desired to change the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.Mr. LoNG. I might say to you, rather facetiously, what I have said to the other district judges of Missouri, while they were sworn in and I know you are going to be sworn in: Don't forget, for 15 yeals you have been on the other side of the bench, and we other lawyers lookingdownMfr. WHITE. Some of the people have suggested I either forget Ihave been on the other side or-Mr. HRUSKA. Senator, I do believe every lawyer in the land doesrejoice when his ranks of the practicing attorney are called upon to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. It means one of their boys has "made it." That rejoicing in this case I am sure is enhanced agood deal by the splendid record that Mr. White has made as evidenced by the testimony here and the hearing that we had previously in January of 1961.The rejoicing is great in the Middle West and in the mountain country because while geography is not necessarily a big factor in matters of this kind, nevertheless, it does play some part; so I do want to say that it is my intention to vote in favor of the confirmation of this nomination.Now, the Senator from Missouri has raised a question about jurisdiction, and so forth. Mr. White, the Constitution in article III, after enumerating the many categories of cases over which the Supreme Court has jurisdiction, goes on to say at the end of the third full paragraph-In all other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact with such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress can make.Have you ever pondered that particular sentence with reference to the possibility of Congress maybe taking some action to create some exception and to perhaps make such regulations as are contemplated in this sentence? And have you contemplated at any time the wisdom perhaps of Congress venturing into that field?Mr. WHITE. Well, Congress has ventured into the field, Senator, and they started very early in our history venturing into this field, in describing the type of cases and describing the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court,, and of course, the Court has discretionary jurisdiction in a great many cases and supposedly there is appeal as of right in others.NOMINATION OF BYRON R. WITEAlso, there are direct appeals from the district courts in inany ofthese areas. In many of these areas, the Congress of the United States has seenfit to prescribe and control and delineate the appellate jurisdiction of the US. Supreme Court, which I think the Constitution contemplates and is quite proper. I think there has been an instance or so in ourhistory where the Congress has, in connection with a specific case, either attempted to or successfully enacted a law which removed the case from the consideration of the Supreme Court. That may be another question.

I am not sure. I would rather not speak without check-in the record on that, but I think it did happen. 

Well, as to types of cases? 

Yes. 

Senator, thank you.(Senator Eastland entered the hearing room.)NOMINATION OF BYRON R. WHITE

Mr. Chairman, could I say just one more word?I came here a year or so ago not knowing any of you gentlemen ex-cept Senator Carroll, and I had met Senator Kefauver. I have had a very enjoyable time working with the committee. I have foundyour deliberations to be extremely wise and helpful, and I know that the country owes all of you a great debt of gratitude. And, person-ally, I shall miss you all, and you, Mr. Chairman.
