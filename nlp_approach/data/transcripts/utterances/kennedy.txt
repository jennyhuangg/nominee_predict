Thank you, Senator. 

I do so swear. 

Thank you, Senator; if I may make just a few remarks.

I most appreciate the gracious welcome from the members of the committee this morning, from Senator Wilson and from the two distinguished Congressmen from their districts in Sacramento, all three of whom I have known for a number of years. This is an appropriate time for me to thank the President for entrusting me with the honor of appearing before you as his nominee for Associate Justice of the United States. My family shares in extending our deep and great appreciation for this or his confidence in me. I wish also to thank the members of your committee, Mr. Chairman, for the most interesting and impressive set of meetings that I have had with you and Members of the Senate as a whole over the last 4 weeks. These are denominated "courtesy calls" in the common parlance, as I understand it. It seems to me that that is perhaps a somewhat casual term for what is a very important and significant part of the advice and consent process. In a number of these advise and consent discussions, Mr. Chairman, you or your colleagues indicated that you wanted to explain to me your own views, your own convictions, your own ideas, your own concerns about the Constitution of the United States. You have indicated that no reply or response was expected from me. And in every case, Mr. Chairman, I was profoundly impressed by the deep commitment to constitutional rule and the deep commitment to judicial independence that each Member of the United States Senate has. I wish your workload were such that you could give the experience that I have had to every nominee for appointment to the courts in the article III system. Now, Mr. Chairman, I understand that it is appropriate, and at your invitation, to introduce my family who are here with me. 

My oldest son, Justin, is a recent graduate of Stanford and is now an assistant project manager for a major corporate relocation in Sacramento. We are delighted to have him home with us in Sacramento. His brother, Gregory, our other son, is a senior at Stanford, and I am authorized to assure the committee that he has taken the LSAT test and is on his way to law school. Our youngest child is Kristin, who is now a sophomore at Stanford majoring in liberal arts, particularly English-and history.90-878 0 - 89 - AFinally, my wife Mary, who has the love and admiration of our family and also of her 30 students in the Golden Empire School in Sacramento. They most appreciate your invitation to be with us here today, Mr. Chairman.Thank you very much. 

I am glad that is part of the record, Mr. Chairman. 

That concludes my opening remarks, Mr. Chairman. I am ready to receive questions from you and your committee members. 

Senator, of course, the great tension, the great debate, the great duality in constitutional law—and this has been true since the court first undertook to interpret the Constitution 200 years ago—has been between what the text says and what the dictates of the particular case require from the standpoint of justice and from the standpoint of our constitutional tradition. The point of my remarks—and we can talk about the Canadian speech in detail, if you choose—was that it is really the great role of the judge to try to discover those standards that implement the intention of the framers.The framers were very careful about the words they used. They were excellent draftsmen. They had drawn 11 constitutions for the separate states. This, they recognized, was a unique undertaking.But the words of the Constitution must be the beginning of our inquiry.Now, how far can you continue that inquiry away from the words of the text? Your question is whether or not there are unenumerated rights. To begin with, most of the inquiries that the Supreme Court has conducted in cases of this type have centered around the word "liberty." Now, the framers used that, what I call "spacious phrase," both in the fifth amendment, almost contemporaneous with the Constitution, and again in the 14th amendment they reiterated it.The framers had an idea which is central to Western thought. 

Thought. It is central to our American tradition. It is central to the idea of the rule of law. That is there is a zone of liberty, a zone of protection, a line that is drawn where the individual can tell the Government: Beyond this line you may not go.Now, the great question in constitutional law is: One, where is that line drawn? And, two, what are the principles that you refer to in drawing that line?

There is a line. It is wavering; it is amorphous; it is uncertain. But this is the judicial function. 

It is hard to disagree with that. That was the second Mr. Justice Harlan. Remember, though, Senator, that the object of our inquiry is to use history, the case law, and our understanding of the American constitutional tradition in order to determine the intention of the document broadly expressed.One of the reasons why, in my view, the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States have such great acceptance by the American people is because of the perception by the people that the Court is being faithful to a compact that was made 200 years ago. The framers sat down in a room for three months. They put aside politics; they put aside religion; they put aside personal differences. And they acted as statesmen to draw a magnificent document. The object of our inquiry is to see what that document means.

Yes, although I am not sure that he spoke in exactly those terms.

I am not trying to quibble, but it may well be the better view, rather than talk in terms of unenumerated rights to recognize that we are simply talking about whether or not liberty extends to situations not previously addressed by the courts, to protections not previously announced by the courts. 

I wish I had a complete answer. The ninth amendment has been a fascination to judges and to students of the Constitution for generations. When Madison—and he was the principal draftsman of the Bill of Rights—wrote the Bill of Rights, he wanted to be very sure that his colleagues, the voters, and the world understood that he did not have the capacity to foresee every verbal formulation that was necessary for the protection of the individual. He was writing and presenting a proposal at a time when State constitutions were still being drafted, and he knew that some State constitutions, for instance the Virginia Bill of Rights went somewhat further than the Constitution of the United States. In my view, one of his principal purposes, simply as a statesman, was to give assurance that this was not a proclamation of every right that should be among the rights of a free people. Now, going beyond that, I think the sense of your question is: Does the ninth amendment have practical significance 

Does the ninth amendment have practical significance in the ongoing determination of constitutional cases? As you know, the Court has rarely found occasion to refer to it. It seems to me the Court is treating it as something of a reserveclause, to be held in the event that the phrase "liberty" and the other spacious phrases in the Constitution appear to be inadequate for the Court's decision.

It seems to me that most Americans, most lawyers, most judges, believe that liberty includes protection of a value that we call privacy. Now, as we well know, that is hardly a selfdefining term, and perhaps we will have more discussions about that.

NO, I have not recalled any such additional instances.

I understood that question in the sense that you describe when I answered the questionnaire, and I understand it that way now. The conversations that I described were the only conversations that occurred.

I was not; I was asked no question which came even close to the zone of what I would consider infringing on judicial independence. I was asked no question which even came close to the zone of what I would consider improper. I was asked no question which came even close to the zone of eliciting a volunteered comment from me as to how I would rule on any particular case, or on any pending issue.

I was not. 

NO such questions were asked, and I volunteered no such comments. 

NO, sir. 

NO. 

NOW let's be precise, however. I think the nomination was sent to the Senate some weeks after it was announced. 

At the time I had already met with you and a number of Senators, but if the demarcation in your question is as to the time the President made the announcement in the White House 

The answer is no, I had not met with any United States Senators prior to that time.

I have not done so, and I would consider it highly improper to do so.

Other than that I would be frank and candid in my answers.

I have not seen that column, but I have absorbed it from what you have said, Senator.To begin with, I think it is important to say that if I had an undisclosed intention, or a fixed view on a particular case, an absolutely concluded position on a particular case or a particular issue, perhaps I might be obligated to disclose that to you.I do not have any such views with reference to privacy, or abortion, or the other subjects there mentioned, and therefore, I was not attempting, and would not attempt to try to signal, by inference, or by indirection, my views on those subjects.The conversation that you referred to was wide-ranging, and of a personal nature. The Senator asked me about my family and mycharacter, and I told him, as I have told others of you, that I admire anyona^ith strong moral beliefs.Now it would be highly improper for a judge to allow his, or her, own personal or religious views to enter into a decision respecting a constitutional matter. There are many books that I will not read, that I do not let, or these days do not recommend, my children read. That does not prohibit me from enforcing the first amendment because those books are protected by the first amendment.A man's, or a woman's, relation to his, or her, God, and the fact that he, or she, may think they are held accountable to a higher power, may be important evidence of a person's character and temperament. It is irrelevant to his, or her, judicial authority. When we decide cases we put such matters aside, and as—I think it was—Daniel Webster said, "Submit to the judgment of the nation as a whole."

TO begin with, that was not the statement. 

We had a wide-ranging discussion and those two matters were not linked. 

In my view, yes. 

That is a far-ranging question, Senator, which would be an excellent law review article, but let me suggest a few factors. First, there is a statistical way to fend off your question, by pointing out that the Supreme Court hears many more cases now than it formerly did. You will recall, in the early days of the Republic, when some cases were argued for days. 

I was using "you" in the institutional sense, Senator. And that has changed. Secondly, the Court has taken many more public-law cases on its docket. And thirdly, there are simply many, many more precedents for the Court to deal with, and so the adjustment, the policing, the shaping of the contours of our law simply require more over ruling, as a statistical matter.That does seem, though, to be not quite a complete answer to your question, because your question invites at least exploration of the idea whether or not the Supreme Court has changed its own role, or its own view of, its role in the system, or has changed the substantive law, and it has.In the last 37 years, the Supreme Court has followed the doctrine of incorporation by reference, so that under the Due Process Clause of the 14th amendment, most of the specific provisions of the first eight amendments have been made applicable to the States, including search and seizure, self-incrimination, double jeopardy, and confrontation. Many of these cases, many of these decisions, involved overruling. So there was a substantive change of doctrine that did cause an increase in the number of overruled cases, Senator.

Thank you very much, Senator. 

Well, the reasons for its survival, and its success, Senator, are many fold. The first is the skill with which it was written. Few times in history have men sat down to control their own destiny before a government took power; in the age of Pericles, and in the Roman empire, just before Augustus, and again, in 1789. The framers wrote with great skill, and that is one reason for the survival of the Constitution, for the survival of the Constitution despite a horrible civil war, a war arguably, and I think probably, necessary to cure a defect in the Constitution.Then there is the respect that the American people have for the rule of law. We have a remarkable degree of compliance with the law in this country, because of the respect that the people have for the Constitution and for the men who wrote it.My third suggestion for why there has been a great success in the American constitutional experience is the respect that each branch of the government shows to the other. This is a vital part of our constitutional tradition. It has remained true since the founding of the Republic.

The frarners thought of the States as really a check-and-balance mechanism, operating, obviously, not on the national level.The idea of preserving the independence, the sovereignty, and the existence of the separate States was of course critical to the Constitution, and it remains critical.Now there are very few automatic mechanisms in the Constitution to protect the States. If you read through the Constitution you will see very little about the rights and prerogatives of the States.At one time, as you all well know, United States Senators were chosen by State legislatures, which gave the States an institutional control over the national government. That has long since disappeared, and I am sure no one argues for its return.But that was one of the few automatic mechanisms for the States to protect themselves. The Congress of the United States is charged, in my view, with the principal duty of preserving the independence of the States, and it can do so in many ways; in the way that it designs its conditional grant-in-aid bills, in the ways that it passes its statutes.The courts, too, have a role, and the courts have devised some verj' important doctrines to protect federalism. The idea of abstention in Younger v. Harris, the Erie rule, the independent State ground rule, have all been designed by the courts out of respect for the States.But in my view, this is the job of every branch of the government.

It is very clear that that was the design of the Constitution.

Well, I am glad you give me a good mark, Senator.

Marbury v. Madison is one of the essential structural elements of the Constitution of the United States. As we all know, the doctrine of judicial review is not explicit in the Constitution. I have very little trouble finding that it was intended. Federalist Number 78 makes that rather clear, and I think that this vital role is one of the critical structural elements of the Constitution, and that it is essential to the maintenance of constitutional rule.

I am not a student of the antitrust law. I try to become one whenever I have an antitrust opinion.This is an area which is one of statutory law, and it is an interesting one because the Congress of the United States has essentially delegated to the courts the duties of devising those doctrines which are designed to insure competition.I have no quarrel with the Congress doing that, because if the courts do not perform adequately, if they do not follow the intent of Congress, there is always a corrective. And I think it is somewhat reassuring that the judiciary has performed well under the antitrust laws.The particular elements that are necessary to preserve competition are of course vigorous enforcement of the law against illegal practices, particularly price fixing, and other prohibited practices.

An important function of the courts, Senator, is to serve as interpreters of expert opinions, and the courts of the United States have received economic testimony, have studied economic doctrine, and have formed these into a series of rules to protect competition.Now economists, like so many others of us, have great disagreements, and we have found—for instance—that economic testimony tells us that some vertical restrictions are actually pro competitive, did the courts have accepted this economic testimony.And I think the courts, all in all, have done a good job of articulating their reasoning in antitrust cases, and identifying when they are relying on economic reasoning. Sometimes that reasoning is wrong, but at least it is identified.

Well, the Court has struggled to draw the appropriate line for determining who may recover and who may not recover in an antitrust case. As we know, if there is an antitrust violation it has ripple consequences all the way through the system.Antitrust cases are ones in which triple damages are recoverable, and therefore, the courts have undertaken to draw a line to allow only those who are primarily injured to recover.Not only is this, it seems to me, necessary simply as a matter of enforcing the antitrust laws, but it reflects, too, the underlying value of federalism, because to the extent to which federal antitrust laws apply, State laws are displaced.Where that line should be, how successful the Illinois Brick doctrine has been in terms of promoting competition, and permitting,at the same time, antitrust plaintiffs to sue when necessary, is a point on which I have not made up my mind.

The Supreme Court has recently issued a decision in which it approves of State statutes which attempts to regulate takeovers.This is a tremendously complex area. It is highly important because business corporations throughout the United States have a fixed-capital investment, and a fixed investment in human resources. They have managers, they have skilled workers, and it is important that they be given protection.Now it seems to me that the States might make a very important contribution in this complex area.

AS to the specific instances, I cannot be particularly helpful to you, Senator. Let me see if I can express what I think are the considerations that the Court should address.There is a continuum here, or a balance. On the one hand, there is a rule of reason, and this involves something of a global judgment in a global lawsuit. A rule of reason antitrust suit is very expensive to try. And once it is tried, it is somewhat difficult to receive much guidance from the decision for the next case.Per se rules, on the other hand, are precise. They are automatic, in many cases, as their name indicates. The problem with per se rules is that the}' may not always reflect the true competitive forces.The Supreme Court has to make some kind of adjustment between these two polar concepts, and it has taken cases on its docket in order to do this.

On diversity jurisdiction, generally—I may be drummed out of the judges' guild—but I am not in favor of a total abolition of diversity jurisdiction. I have tried cases in the federal courts, and I realize their importance.On the other hand, we simply must recognize that the federal courts' time is extremely precious. The Congress of the United States has vitally important goals that it wants enforced by the federal courts.Rather than looking at jurisdictional limits, which can be avoided, and which are the subject of further controversy as to whether or not they have been adequately pleaded, it seems to me that perhaps Congress should look at certain types of cases which could be excluded from the diversity jurisdiction, say, auto-accident cases.It seems to me that that is a better approach, generally. 

Well, it is somewhat tempting, with diversity jurisdiction, to think that we could take a byzantine area of the law, and simply make it irrelevant by abolishing the jurisdiction. Many lawyers, many judges, would think Congress had done them a great favor if they made that whole branch of our learning simply irrelevant. On the other hand, I think the commitment to diversity jurisdiction, both in the Constitution and in many segments of the bar, is sufficiently strong so that the better approach is to find a class of cases that we can eliminate from the jurisdiction, rather than abolishing it altogether. 

I cannot point to page and verse to show that the comments of law-enforcement officials have had a specific influence, but it seems to me that they should. The Court must recognize that these rules are preventative rules imposed by the Court in order to enforce constitutional guarantees; and that they have a pragmatic purpose; and if the rules are not working they should be changed. And for this reason, the Court should pay close attention to the consequences of what it has wrought. Certainly comments of lawenforcement officials, taken in the proper judicial context, it seems to me, are relevant to that judgment. 

Are relevant. 

AS to the specifics of a proposal, of course I could not and would not pass on it. It is true that when we have an execution which is imminent, say, 30 days, the courts, particularly at the appellate level, begin undergoing feverish activity, activity which is quite inconsistent with their usual orderly, mature, deliberate way of proceeding. We are up past midnight with our clerks, grabbing books off the wall, and phoning for more information, where a man's life—it is usually a man—is hanging in the balance. And this does foster not a good perception of the judiciary. It is a feverish kind of activitythat is not really in keeping with what should be a very deliberate and ordered process.Justice O'Connor who is the Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit is concerned about this. She has asked the Ninth Circuit to draft some procedures in order to make this a more orderly process. Any guidance that the Congress of the United States could give would, I think, be an important contribution to the administration of justice.I really do not know how you are going to avoid it, but it is something that we should give attention to.

Generally, the answer to that question is yes. As I have indicated before, I think the courts play a very vital function by taking the expert, highly detailed, highly complex findings of an agency, and recasting them in terms that the courts themselves, the litigants, and the public at large, can understand. While with reference to particular agencies there may be areas for improvement by statute, I think generally the system of administrative review is working well.

Well, I hope, Senator, that some months from now I will have a chance to take a look at that firsthand. But it seems to me from the standpoint of a circuit judge that there are some problems with that proposal.Circuit judges, I think, work under an important constraint when they know that they are writing for review by the Supreme Court of the United States, and not by some of their colleagues.Furthermore, if you had a national court of appeals, it would not simply resolve particular issues; it would have its own case law, which would have its own conflicts.And I am concerned about that. Further, as I understand the statistics, this would save the Supreme Court about 35 cases a year, maybe 50. In all of those cases, the circuit courts have already expressed their views, and so theSupreme Court has a very good perspective of what choices there are to make.If those 50 cases were taken away, the nature of the docket of the Supreme Court might change. The Supreme Court might hear all public law cases in which the juridical philosophies that obtain on the court would divide them in more cases.It seems to me somewhat healthy for the Supreme Court to find something that it can agree on.

And incidentally, this was a suggestion made by Arthur Hellman in a very perceptive law review article that I read a few years ago. 

Well, Senator, in the past few weeks, most of my thoughts have been on how to get on the Supreme Court, not how to get off it.But my views are that I would view with some disfavor either of those proposals. The Supreme Court is sufficiently small, sufficiently collegial, sufficiently visible, that I think if a member of the court is incapable of carrying his or her workload, there are enough pressures already to resign.History has been very kind to us in this regard. 

I am with you, Senator. 

The repeat players in the legal system—insurance companies, in some cases public interest lawyers—are very, very good. The person that has one brush with the legal system is at risk. I wish I could tell the committee that most of the arguments I hear on the court of appeals, and we come from a great and respected circuit, are fine and brilliant and professional arguments. They are not.You gentlemen are the experts on what to do. I think we have to attack it at every level, in the law schools, with Inns of Court, with judges participating with the bar, and with an insistence that the highest standards of advocacy pertain in the federal courts.It is a problem that persists. And it is a problem that should be addressed.We had in the ninth circuit a committee study for 4 years on whether or not we should impose standards on the attorneys that practice in the federal courts of the ninth circuit. We finally came up with a proposal that they had to certify that they had read the rules. And it was turned down. So judges, as well as attorneys, must be more attentive to this problem.

Thank you, sir. 

I was handed a note to that effect. And I did not understand your question that way. But it is true that I met with a number of your colleagues. 

I will put on a helmet when you do, Senator. [Laughter.]

Well, Senator, at the outset, it is entirely proper, of course, for you to seek assurance that a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States is sensitive to civil rights.We simply do not have any real freedom if we have discrimination based on race, sex, religion or national origin, and I share that commitment.Now, in the particular case, what occurred was, plaintiffs who themselves were not homebuyers went to real estate agents and were turned down allegedly because of their color, or were not turned down but were shown a black community if they were black or to a white community if they were white.This is, of course, of critical concern because brokers are a small channel in the stream of housing sales. And if there is discrimination at that point, that is a good point to attack it.Now in a sense, I think it is incorrect, Senator, to say that I threw them out of court. There were two provisions in the law.One provision provided for immediate redress from a court of law. Another provision, which I believe was Section 810, required that the plaintiffs must go first to the agency responsible for enforcement of anti-discrimination in housing laws.Because there were some unresolved questions as to standing at the time of this litigation, we thought that Congress, in its scheme, had made a distinction based on the degree of injury that the particular plaintiff had shown.We found no other way to explain the difference in the two sections. And we indicated in the opinion that administrative remedies may be superior in some cases to judicial remedies.The lesson of the Voting Rights Act cases, and the Voting Rights Act statutes, is that courts can be very inefficient. One of the great lessons for courts taught by the Voting Rights Act statutes is that there are remedies other than courts if civil rights are being deprived.We thought this was a creative, important, helpful statement of what Congress had in mind. The Supreme Court said we were wrong, and I certainly have no quarrel with the decision. I was puzzled by the statute. And so far as the Supreme Court's decision is concerned, I would willingly and fully enforce it.

Yes. You are entitled to that assurance. And I have the greatest respect for the lead that the Congress has taken in this area.We had thought that this was really the appropriate way to explain why the two sections were different. In that respect, we thought we were being faithful to the drafting of the statute and the structure of the statute.It is true, of course, that these laws must be generously enforced, or people are going to get hurt.

This was a vitally important case. I reviewed it only last night, and didn't have the record in front of me. But I recall the case.It was unfortunately an all too typical case in which a young man had emotional problems. He found it very difficult to adjust to school.And his mother was distraught, not only over how her child was developing, but over the battle she had to have with the administrative agency to get him special care.The question was whether or not, if the school disagreed with the mother initially and said, no, we will not pay for the special care, whether the school, after the administrative agency had ruled in favor of the mother, had to pay for the cost of the special instruction in the interim.We thought that the normal administrative remedies rule and exhaustion rule were written into the statute. There was a socalled stay-put provision in the statute, which we thought required the parent to leave the child in the hands of the school authorities if the school authorities did not agree with the parent; and in many cases, school authorities agree with the parent. In many cases, there is an agreement, and they immediately send the child.The fourth, the seventh and the eighth circuits agreed with as. The first did not and the Supreme Court unanimously did not.I have seen the necessity for spending more money in the schools on education across the board. And we were being asked in this case to say that a local school district, an entity of the State, was required to pay this sum.We thought a question of federalism was involved, in that school districts are strapped for every penny.It is true that the Congress of the United States had a policy in favor of supporting education for these disturbed children, and of course that should be given full and vigorous enforcement.I have absolutely no problem with the Supreme Court's decision. It said that exhaustion of administrative remedies wras not necessary.The Court also made another very important statement. We had said that these are damages against the State. And the Supreme Court of the United States said, well, these are not damages. These are simply payments that the State had to make all along, and the State is really not injured. I fully accept and endorse the reasoning in that case, Senator.

Well, of the cost of the special school, yes, sir. 

I do not think those statutes should be interpreted grudgingly. There is a certain amount of finger pointing that goes on here where the courts say the Congress did not write the statute clearly enough, and more or less saddles Congress with the duty of cleaning up the language. I have come to recognize thatthe workload of the Congress is such that we have to interpret the statutes as they are given to us.

Discrimination comes from several sources. Sometimes it is active hostility. And sometimes it is just insensitivity and indifference.Over the years, I have tried to become more sensitive to the existence of subtle barriers to the advancement of women and of minorities in society. This was an issue on which I was continuing to educate myself.I want to see a society in which young women who are professionals have the same opportunity as I did to join a club where they meet other professionals. I would like that opportunity for my daughter if she were a practicing lawyer or in the business world.With reference to the Olympic Club, in part it has the atmosphere of a YMCA with its downtown facilities reserved for me. I used it and enjoyed it and found it helpful.In the late spring of 1987, this year, the U.S. Open was sponsored at the Olympic Club. At that time publicity surfaced that it did not have some racial minorities as members.That was not a policy of the club, as I understood it, but it was pretty clear that the mix was not there if you looked at the membership rolls. The club expressly excluded women.There was an article in the New Yorker magazine which really triggered my action. A very fine sports writer wrote about the Open and talked about the egalitarian history of the club.I wrote a letter to the club, which the committee has, in which I indicated that it was time to make the egalitarian spirit a reality.I had discussions with the legal counsel for the club. I knew no directors of the club or officers. I indicated that in my view it was high time that the Olympic Club changed.They did have a membership meeting, as you've indicated, in part as a result of my discussions, but in part as a result of the action of the city attorney, and concerns expressed by other members.I actually had heard that the bylaw that you referred to had passed. The board of directors were optimistic that it would, and somebody actually reported back to me that it had passed. I was not a voting member and cannot vote and was not at the meeting.When I heard that the bylaw had been turned down, principally the objection was women in the athletic facility, not racial minorities.I thought that my position had become quite untenable. I therefore resigned before I talked to the members of the Administration, thinking that it was not fair either to the Administration or the Members of this distinguished body to make that an issue.

NO question about it. It is downtown. It is a luncheon club.

That is the distinction I drew. 

Thank you for giving me that opportunity. In my view, none of these clubs practiced invidious discrimination. That term is not a precise and crystal clear term. But as I understood it and as I have defined it in the questionnaire, none of the clubs did practice that, or had that as a policy. 

There is no question that the injury and the hurt and the personal hurt can be there, regardless of the motive. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes. The Sutter Club is in downtown Sacramento. It is a club that is primarily used at luncheon by professional and business people. I was always seen there as a judge when I went there. And I had concerns with their restrictive policies against women. Again, some of the great leaders in Sacramento city life, some of my very best friends, people who have no animosity, people who have sensitivity and goodwill, are members of those clubs. I in no way wish to criticize them, because many feel as I do that the policy should be changed. I, however, felt that my membership there was one where I was there only as a judge, and that it was inappropriate for me to belong. And I resigned in 1980 before the canons of ethics on the subject were promulgated. 

Yes. Everybody knew me there as a judge, and would come up and greet me and so forth. And I felt uncomfortable in that position. 

Probably because nobody knew me, and I basically used the athletic facility.

Yes, although I think sometimes continued membership can be helpful. In California the rule is that judges should remain in those clubs and attempt to change their policies and resign only when it becomes clear that those attempts are unavailing.

Well, they were not intended to do so. I think women felt real hurt, and there was just cause for them to want access to these professional contacts.It is most unfortunate, and almost Dickensian, for a group of lawyers to meet at 11:30 and to settle a case and to celebrate and say, well, let's all go to the club. And suddenly there is a silence, and they cannot go because there is a woman there. That is stigmatizing. That is inappropriate.

Yes, sir. 

That is correct, sir. 

Well, it has been a club that is principally prominent in athletics. And it has promoted athletics for young people in the community for over 100 years. It is recognized as a club with a strong sense of civic obligation. It has athletic meets and so forth at its facilities. 

The Olympic Club was founded in the 19th century and I joined in 1962. 

Yes, sir. 

I was not involved in it at all. I know from the press that it was a great event for the club, and they made arrangements to serve all of those who purchased a ticket to come in and watch the golf match, and they wanted to put their best foot forward, of course, because it is a great event.

Well, the reaction in the community is one I can only gauge by the press. There were press stories on it. It did not seem to dampen attendance at the Open or interest in the Open.But I thought there was a problem disclosed by that, and that problem was not going away. That was very clear.

I cannot answer that question, Senator. 

That is plausible. 

Yes, sir. 

That was my position. And I urged the board to go ahead with the membership poll and see if the bylaw change could be effected. 

Yes, Senator. 

I don't know what it was; three to two is my guess. There are some 7,000 members of the club. I had better not guess what the vote was. I'm not allowed to come to meetings: I'm not a voting member, but apparently it was a great debate. The membership was divided on it. Apparently the board of directors are going to continue to try to press for this change. 

Well, I was originally informed that the vote had been successful, that the measure had been successful to change the by-laws. So I congratulated myself for having played a small part in bringing the membership meeting about. It came to my attention about a week later that my information was wrong. The proposal had actually been turned down. So I wrote a letter saying that my position had simply become untenable. 

NO, sir. 

It is a country club in Sacramento with a golf course and a swimming pool. I had been a member of it when I was a boy. My family and children enjoyed it. And again, I have the greatest respect for the members of that club. The by-laws of the club, in 1975 when I became a judge, used male pronouns and led to the inference that it was male-only membership, although there were some women members. I objected to the by-laws being written in those terms and the board of directors changed the by-laws. My purpose in making the recommendation was so that it would be clear that women would be admitted to the club. Women are admitted to the club as members, but a quick look at the roster shows there is not any kind of a representative mix based on the professional community. However, the club does not have a policy or a practice of excluding on the basis of sex or race as far as I know. 

Yes.

Thank you. 

That is a downtown club primarily used for luncheon. It is a very well-knowTn club used by many in the government and in business. The club sometimes has grand functions in the evening which are open for parties that are sponsored by members, and persons of all races and gender are welcome. 

Yes. 

That is about right. 

That is my understanding, that the practice was fairly clear. 

I was concerned about the policy of excluding women. I went to the club for lunch and was known, really, only as a judge. Although I had many close friends there, it seemed to me I was really there in my professional capacity. I was concerned about the appearance of impartiality. 

Again, I simply used the club for its athletic facilities. I really was not an active participant in the club, but I know that they undertake any number of civic and charitable activities and that membership in the club is viewed by all who are in it as a privilege and as a way to furthering charitable and civic purposes. 

I do not know, Senator. 

It is in my questionnaire. 

I just do not have the dates. I believe I resigned shortly after I became a judge.

The first amendment may be first, although we are not sure, because the framers thought of it as the most important. It applies not just to political speech, although that is clearly one of its purposes. In that respect it ensures the dialogue that is necessary for the continuance of the democratic process. But it also applies, really, to all ways in which we express ourselves as persons. It applies to dance and to art and to music. These features of our freedom are to many people as important or more important than political discussions or searching for philosophical truth. The first amendment covers all of these forms of speech.Of course, the first amendment also protects the press. One of the unfortunate things about the case law is that the great cases on the press are New York Times v. Sullivan and United States v. New York Times and The Washington Post. But the press is not monolithic. In Northern California I believe that there are 37 small papers that in many cases are literally "mom and pop" operations where the editor has to stop writing at noon because he has to start working the printing press. These papers simply must have the protection of the first amendment if they are to be vigorous in reporting on matters of interest to their readers insofar as their locality is concerned. They vitally need the protection of the first amendment. It is not just for The Washington Post and The New York Times.

What happened in that case, as I recall it, was that a person who was the subject of what is called a docu-drama was concerned that his rights were being infringed by the publication, or by the broadcast of the television show. He was a some-what celebrated figure who had allegedly committed serious wrongdoings in a financial scam.The trial judge was sufficiently concerned about the allegations that he ordered the television network to bring the tape to the courtroom and show the tape. This was a matter, really, of hours or maybe a day or so before the broadcast was to go on nationwide TV.I presided over a three-judge panel in an emergency motion. He issued the order at 11:30 and we vacated it at 5 minutes to 12. We said that it was a prior restraint on speech and that for the district judge to order the film delivered was in itself an interference with the rights of the press. I wrote the opinion and issued it a few days later. That is the Goldblum opinion.

This was a case in which one of the coprincipals or accomplices in the DeLorean drug matter had entered a guilty plea and then applied to the district court, as is his right, to modify the sentence. The Government of the United States joined with the attorney for the defendant in asking that the documents be filed under seal.The press objected. There was standing for the objection, and we ruled that those documents could not be filed under seal. We indicated that the public has a vital interest in ascertaining the sentencing policies of the court. I think I indicated that this is one of the least satisfactory portions of the entire criminal justice system and that the public ought to know if a sentence was being reduced and why.

This was a case in which we were asked to interpret a new statute passed by the Congress. We thought we had guidance from the Court that controlled the decision. We expressed the view, as we understood the law of the Supreme Court, that this was speech by proxy. This was not direct speech by the person who was spending the money, rather he or she was delegating it to an intermediary. We thought that was a sufficient grounds for the Congress of the United States in the interest of ensuring the purity of the election process to regulate the amount of the contribution.

Well, Senator, I do not think that there is a choice between order and liberty. We can have both. Without ordered liberty, there is no liberty at all. One of the highest priorities of society is to protect itself against the corruption and the corrosiveness and the violence of crime. In my view judges must not shrink from enforcing the laws strictly and fairly in the criminal area. They should not have an identity crisis or self-doubts when they have to impose a severe sentence.It is true that we have a system in this country of policing the police. We have a system in this country that requires courts to reverse criminal convictions when the defendant is guilty. We have a system in this country under which relevant, essential, necessary, probative, convincing evidence is not admitted in the court because it was improperly seized. This illustrates, I suppose, that constitutional rights are not cheap. Many good things in life are not cheap and constitutional rights are one of them. We pay a price for constitutional rights.My view of interpreting these rules is that they should be pragmatic. They should be workable. We have paid a very heavy cost to educate judges and police officers throughout this country, and the criminal system works much better than many people give it credit for. In every courthouse at whatever level throughout the country, even if it is a misdemeanor traffic case, the judge knows the Miranda rule, he knows the exclusionary rule, and so do the police officers that bring the case before him. We have done a magnificent job of educating the people in the criminal justice system.On the other hand, it is sometimes frustrating for the courts, as it is frustrating for all of us, to enforce a rule in a hypertechnical way when the police or the prosecutor have made a mistake in good faith. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule is one of the Court's recent pronouncements to try to meet some of these concerns. It remains to be seen how workable that exception is.Sometimes exceptions can swallow the rule, and the Court has yet to stake out all of the dimensions of this exception.That is just a rough expression of my general philosophy in the area.

YOU know, Senator, I went to one of the great law schools in the country—I am sorry Senator Specter is not here to agree with that—and I never heard the word "victim" in three years uf law school, except maybe from the standpoint of an apology that a corpus delicti was not present. This is the wrong focus. We simply must remember that sometimes the victim who is required to testify, who misses work without pay, who sits in the courthouse hallway with no special protection, and who is stared at by the defendant and harassed by the defendant's counsel, undergoes an ordeal that is almost as bad as the crime itself.The Congress of the United States has made a very important policy statement in passing the Victims Assistance Act. It has given the courts a new focus, and a focus that is a very, very important one in the system. Judges recognize that victims, too, have rights.

Absolutely, Senator. They are the front-line agency for administering the criminal justice system, and we have much to do, particularly in the area of corrections, which judges do not know much Jbout. But in so far as the enforcement of the criminal laws, the courts do have the responsibility to ensure that their procedures are efficient, that they understand the law, and that they apply it faithfully.

Yes, sir. 

Senator, I have a little difficulty in answering that question because my characterization of the arguments might bear on the petition for rehearing.

That case is still before us. 

I would rather not characterize an argument in a way that would seem either too generous, or too limited for the particular parties in that case. 

This case is also appearing before us—or, rather, is still before us on remand from the Supreme Court of the United States—so I will give only a capsule description. A newspaper reporter was killed when a bomb was placed in his car by a person connected with the Mafia. The reporter lost both arms and both legs, but lived for 10 days. He identified the defendant in this case, Adamson. Adamson was brought to trial, but the question was whether or not Adamson would tell who paid him to do this work. As part of a plea bargain, Adamson did agree to testify, and in exchange, the State of Arizona reduced the charge to second-degree murder. I think that is accurate; but, in any event, the State dropped the capital sentence demand that it had made earlier. Adamson did testify, the two were convicted. The Supreme Court of Arizona then reversed, so another trial was called for. At this point Adamson said that he wanted to change the deal. The question came to our court whether or not his double jeopardy rights had been properly protected. Some of my colleagues thought they had not. Some of us thought that the plea bargain itself was clear warning to Adamson that he had certain rights that were being waived. I was in the dissenting position. The Supreme Court of the United States agreed with the dissenters. The case has now been sent back to the ninth circuit on other issues. 

Yes, sir. 

That is correct.)0-878 0 - 8 9 - 5

Yes, sir. 

Thank you, Senator. 

It is very fair, Senator. Since I have been doing this to attorneys for 12 years, it is only fair that it be done to me. 

I have really not had the opportunity, Senator, to address, ' i any detail, the levels of scrutiny that apply to gender, or, t compare them to race.I think you are correct. I have had Equal Protection Clause cases, mostly in the implementation phase rather than in defining substantive liability.

I would think that would be correct, Senator. 

Yes, the amendment by its terms, of course, includes all persons, and I think was ver}^ deliberately drafted in that respect. 

That is my understanding of the standard that the Court has enunciated. 

I cannot think, at the moment, of any of the standard law-school hypotheticals, that would lead to the conclu-sion that a racial classification that is invidious would be sustained under an equal protection challenge.

Yes, and sometimes those cases are difficult, because if you have a first amendment case, it often can really be explained on its own terms. The first amendment sits on its own foundation, so it is sometimes puzzling why we even need an equal protection analysis in such cases, although the Court has had first amendment cases in which it uses an equal protection analysis.Why that is necessary is not clear to me, since one of the essential features of the first amendment is that we cannot engage in censorship. Censorship involves choice, so the first amendment does seem to have its own foundation in this regard.

That is my understanding of the case law. The Court, as an institution, and the judicial system generally has not had the historical experience with gender discrimination cases that we have had with racial discrimination cases. The law there really seems to me in a state of evolution at this point. It is going to take more cases for us to ascertain whether or not the heightened scrutiny standard is sufficient to protect the rights of women, or whether or not the strict standard should be adopted.

Well, it may be that in resolving one of those cases, I would give attention to Justice Marshall's standard and make a determination whether or not that is a better expression than the three-tier standard that the Court seems to use, although it seems to me, on analysis, that those are very close.

NO. I understand what the Court is driving at, and as I have indicated, it is probably because the Court simply lacks the historical background to feel that it can impose the strictscrutiny standard without causing problems for itself down the line.

Well, I think the Court has, as 1 say, recognized the fact that the law is in a state of evolution and flux, and is proceeding rather cautiously.

The cases seem to me a plausible and rational way to begin implementing the Equal Protection Clause.

The cases seem to me a plausible and a rational way to begin implementing the Equal Protection Clause. 

Yes, it is, and as we know, all laws discriminate.

YOU can get a driver's license if you are over 16 but not if you are under 16. Yet we know that there are some drivers who are under 16 who are much better than many drivers who are over sixteen. But we have a fixed and arbitrary standard. That is the way laws must be written in order to have an efficient society and an efficient legislative system. 

I have not written on it. 

I ask my students to explain to me why there is any difference between that and the three-tier standard, and I am not yet satisfied what the correct answer to that question should be.

I do not have a fixed or determined view. I would offer this observation: one beneficial feature of a tier standard is that the court makes clear the substantive weight that it is giving to the particular claim before it, and the court can then be criticized, or vindicated as the case may be.It sets standards. And the lower courts have a certain amount of guidance. The Supreme Court is in the difficult position of hearing 150 cases a year, and in doing so, providing the requisite doctrinal guidance and supervision of the lower courts.This is a very difficult task, and not much has been written on the difference between an intermediate appellate court judge, such as I am, and the responsibilities of the judge of a supreme court of a State or the Supreme Court of the United States.Judge Sneed of our court is always careful to point out that this is an area of academic inquiry that should be explored. I think the requirements, and the duties and the obligations, and the concerns of those two different courts may be quite divergent.

It is tremendously helpful. We wish that the Supreme Court could review most of our cases.As you know, the Supreme Court takes only about 2 percent of the judgments of the circuit courts, and within that case mix it has the duty to give us the necessary guidance.This of course is the way the case law method evolves, but we wish we could have more guidance from the Court.

Well, I have indicated that is essentially correct. I prefer to think of the value of privacy as being protected by the liberty clause; that is a semantic quibble, maybe it is not.

Yes, sir. 

Yes, sir. 

Again, I am not sure. I think the Court finds a surer guide in the 14th amendment or the fifth amendment, because the word liberty is there. In the ninth, of course, it is simply an unenumerated right. I think also that the Court has this problem: as we have indicated, Mr. Madison, and his colleagues, were concerned with the ninth amendment to assure the States that they had adequate freedom for the writing of their own constitutions, but under the incorporation clause that is flipped around. Under the incorporation clause, the ninth amendment would actually be used as a constraint on the States, and I think the Court may have some difficulty in moving in that direction. I do not think the Court has foreclosed that, and I do not think, for reasons—as I have indicated—that it should address the issue until it has to. 

Well, the enforcement power of the judiciary is to insure that the word liberty in the Constitution is given its full and necessary meaning, consistent with the purposes of the document as we understand it.There are many rights, it seems to me, that you could put in a charter if you were writing a charter anew. The right to be adequately housed and fed, and education, and other kinds of affirmative rights.You see this in the European Convention on Human Rights, which is what I was trying to contrast in the Canadian speech with the Canadian constitution. We had three documents. It seems to me an important point, that the Constitution works best if we have a stable and a just society.The political branches of the Government can do much to insure that these preconditions exist for the responsible exercise of our freedom. And I think the courts are subjected to constraints, obviously, that the political branches are not, especially in that the courts cannot initiate those programs and those requisites that are necessary to insure that some very basic human needs are met.

That would be my general view. 

I think that is 

Yes. As I understand the case law, the Court has been very cautious about stating that there is a fundamental right to vote that stands on its own foundation, simply to avoid having to make this kind of inquiry. Whether or not one of those cases will arise in the future, I am just not sure. 

I think that is a beginning point. 

Yes. 

Yes, this was really, I think, the first case in the circuits on the question whether or not the armed services, in this case the Navy, could dismiss its personnel for having engaged in homosexual conduct while in the military. This case required the court to undertake a rather comprehensive study of what the Supreme Court had said on the issue to that point. We reiterated what we thought the Supreme Court had taught us with reference to substantive due process, to the rights of privacy and to the rights of persons, and we set forth there our understanding of the rules. We assumed arguendo, made the assumption, that in some cases homosexual activity might be protected.We did not say it would be because that issue was not before us. We decided instead only the narrow issue of whether or not in the specific context of conduct occurring in the military the Navy had a right and an interest which was sufficient to justify the termination and the discharge of the personnel.

Well, that is correct except that you might have argued that tfyis right was so fundamental and so all-embracing that the military could not

Could not abridge it in any event. For analytic purposes, we simply left to another day the question whether or not there is this fundamental right. In other contexts, we assumed that there could be. We said that in the context of the military there were adequate, stated, articulated reasons for the enforcement of the policy. 

Thank you, sir. 

I am looking forward to that, Senator. 

Yes, sir. 

That is correct, Senator. It was a three-judge panel on each of those cases. 

And, as you know, each judge researches the record independently and we usually come to the bench not havingconferred with one another in order to ensure both the fact and the appearance of fairness for the litigants. We confer only after the oral argument.

Yes. 

Yes. 

That is correct. We thought both of them were close cases in which we were trying to divine the will of Congress. 

Well, Senator, sometimes one asks the question, does a good lawyer really make a difference? The questioner I think, may think it a trick question because if you say yes, then you are not listening to the law, and if you say no, then you are just wasting your time listening to the oral argument.But these cases are very, very difficult, and the law draws its sources from many places. Judges listen to many voices. The constraints and the compulsions of the facts of the particular case, and of the legislative history, all have to be brought to bear on the specific case before the court. Far more often than most people realize, the three judges on that panel all have their minds made up during the oral argument.It is the time that I use to make up my mind. I wait until that oral argument. It is a tremendously important half hour or hour. It is very important that counsel be skilled.Oh, sometimes we know that the counsel just has not seen the problem, and we will see it for him and save the case. But really, we have to impress upon the bar that the duty of the lawyer is to the client, and he may not let the court do the work for him or her. There should just be no shoddy practice in the federal courts; and there is too much of it.

I am committed to that. The former Chief Justice, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, did a marvelous service to the Constitution and to the rule of law when he insisted on this throughout the country. This is not to denigrate the legal profession or the law schools. They are doing a magnificent job.But one of the frustrations of being a judge is that we get away from the practice somewhat. I see or hear of things going on in the practice, and conclude the ethic is changing out there. The law practice has become much more of a marketplace than of an ethical discipline, and I am concerned about that. But I am so far removed from the practice that I am not sure there is a whole lot I can do about it, other than to talk about the problem.

I think it is vital. 

Just to go back one moment 

I am still on that committee, Senator. 

I am trying to—1 believe that I was. I had summer jobs where I did manual labor, usually in the oil fields, but one summer I worked in a lumber mill and I believe I was a member of the Millworkers union. At least I remember paying the money. I do not know if that made me a member or not.

NO judge comes to the bench as a clean slate and completely free of all compulsions and restraints from his background. Therefore I think the background of a person, his temperament and his character, or her background, temperament and character, are of relevance to your consideration. I have been pleased to make available to you my life so far as I can remember it, Senator.

Thank you very much, Senator.

I have to say since I am under oath that teaching is the most enjoyable day of my week. I love it.

From what I hear about the workload, I think the answer must be no, Senator.

I fear that if I were appointed to the Supreme Court that it might. In the ninth circuit there would be maybe two or three times a year in which I would get a little close to a case that was before me, and so I thought I would stay away from it. But you know what the usual drill is. You simply ask the student the question and then you take the opposite side.I always made it clear to my students that I did not care what they thought but I did care passionately how they came to that conclusion, within certain broad limits of tolerance, of course.

Well, Senator, the constitutional law course as it is now composed no longer includes criminal procedure, so I was not able to discuss that with my students. As you have indicated, I get somewhat, at least by inference, more credit for the Leon casethan I deserve, because I did not find that there had been an illegal search in that case.

Yes, sir. 

I was on a panel and authored the decision in a case called the United States v. Peterson in which drug enforcement agents relied on the statement of Philippine law officials for the proposition that they could tap a telephone.They interdicted a ship some 100 miles off the coast of California with a huge volume of illegal drugs on it. We held that the good faith exclusionary rule applied in the circumstances on the theory that the officers acted reasonably in relying on the assurances of their foreign counterparts. So I have addressed that issue. There was no warrant there.Whether or not it should apply to warrantless searches in the United States is a question that I have not addressed, and I would want to consider very deliberately whether or not the rule should be extended to those instances because you then get, as you know, into the problem of objective versus subjective bad faith. You must be very careful to ensure that by the exception you do not swallow the rule.

I can not recall that article or that interview. I saw another article about it just yesterday or the day before. I would say that the law would be an impoverished subject if my views did not change over 20 years.As I understand the Establishment Clause doctrine, the Court has a very difficult problem because, as you know, the Establishment Clause, which tells us that the Government should not aid or assist religion, in some senses works at cross purposes with the free exercise clause. The classic example is the furnishing of a chaplain to the military. If the Government furnishes the chaplain, it is in a sense assisting religion. If it does not it is denying soldiers whose conduct is completely controlled by their officers the free exercise of their religion. So the clauses sometimes point in different directions.Now, the test the Supreme Court has for Establishment Clause cases is whether or not the particular legislation or governmental program adopted has the purpose or the effect of aiding religion or of hurting religion and whether or not there is a forbidden entanglement of religion. The Court is struggling with that test on a case-by-case basis. The decisions are difficult to reconcile, Senator.In this area more than in almost any other one the Court has relied on the historic practices of the people of the United States, and has found in history a guide to a decision. In that respect in this area history has been helpful to the Supreme Court. It seems to me that that is an appropriate reference in those cases.Where I would draw the line in any given case is a question that I have not addressed in my circuit decisions so far. I have no really fixed views on the subject other than to say that the framers were very careful about this. Many of the framers were religious people, but they were careful not to allow that to enter into the debates in the Constitutional Convention.Madison was very concerned about religious intolerance and so when Alexander Hamilton asked for the protection of contracts, Madison asked that the test oath clause be put in the main body of the Constitution. The main body of the Constitution contains religious protection and the framers were very, very conscious of this. It is a fundamental value of the Constitution of the United States that the Government does not impermissibly assist or aid all religions or any one religion over the other.

In those halcyon days, Senator, when our current President was Governor of the State of California and Edwin Meese, I suppose his executive secretary, I am not sure exactly of the title, the Governor's administration concluded that it was time to propose to the people of the State of California an amendment which would limit the spending of the government of the State of California. It was a rather complex proposal designed to impose a spending limit. It was hoped that tax reform would follow from that. The spending limit was based on a percentage of the total gross product for the State of California, and the permitted spending, expressed as a percentage, was to decline each year. It was a highly complex measure.The Governor at the time believed very strongly that the citizens of the State of California should be able to control their government. He and Mr. Meese asked if I would be the draftsman for this complex proposal. One of the reasons the proposal failed of adoption, I am told, is it was too difficult for people to understand. I understood it, but it was an exceptionally complex document. It was very interesting to work on.

Well, thank you.

I would agree that they certainly are, Senator. And in the negative form they are easily understood well, not always easily enforced, but I think easily understood.

In any case, Senator, the role of the judge is to approach the subject with an open mind, to listen to the counsel, to look at the facts of the particular case, to see what the injury is, see what the hurt is, to see what the claim is, and then to listen to his or her colleagues, and then to research the law. What does the most recent precedent, the precedent that is before the Court if it is being examined for a possible overruling, and what does that precedent say? What is its logic? What is its reasoning? What has been its acceptance by the lower courts? Has the rule proven to be workable? Does the rule fit with what the judge deems to be the purpose of the Constitution as we have understood it over the last 200 years? History is tremendously important in this regard.Now, as you well appreciate, and as you certainly know, Senator, stare decisis is not an automatic mechanism. We do not just pull a stare decisis lever or not pull it in any particular case. Stare decisis is really a description of the whole judicial process that proceeds on a case-by-case basis as judges slowly and deliberately decide the facts of a particular .case and hope their decision yields a generalprinciple that may be of assistance to themselves and to later courts.Stare decisis ensures impartiality. That is one of its principal uses. It ensures that from case to case, from judge to judge, from age to age, the law will have a stability that the people can understand and rely upon, that judges can understand and rety upon, and that attorneys can understand and rely upon. That is a very, very important part of the system.Now there have been discussions that stare decisis should not apply as rigidly in the constitutional area as in other areas. The argument for that is that there is no other overruling body in the constitutional area. In a stare decisis problem involving a nonconstitutional case, the Senate and the House of Representatives can tell us we are wrong by passing a bill. That can not happen in the constitutional case.On the other hand, it seems to me that when judges have announced that a particular rule is found in the Constitution, it is entitled to very great weight. The Court does two things: it interprets history and it makes history. It has got to keep those two roles separate. Stare decisis helps it to do that.

I, at the outset. Senator, would like to underscore that I have not committed myself as to the constitutionality of the death penalty. I have stated that if it is found to be constitutional it should be enforced.With reference to its being used in a discriminatory manner, there are at least two safeguards. The first is that the legislature itself defines the category of crimes that deserve the ultimate punishment. The second is that courts develop, articulate, and pronounce rules for instructions to the jury so that the jury's decision is properly channeled. You know better than I because of your experience in the trial courts, Senator, the tremendous power of that jury. Juries simply must be given clear guidelines so that they can apply the death penalty on a consistent basis.It is not clear to me that under the existing law that requisite has been satisfied in some of the cases that I have reviewed. On the other hand, I recognize the difficulty in formulating these standards that I so blithely recommend.

AS you know, Senator, if you look at article II of the Constitution, it is much different in style than article I.Article I, which specifies the powers of the legislative branch, is quite detailed. Article II is not. It is almost as if it were written by different people. It was not, but it looks that way.It is a text in which you have to isolate phrases in order to pick out what the President's powers are. The President's power is to exercise the executive power; that is the way article II begins; he has the powers of the commander in chief; he has the power of appointment, the power to receive ambassadors, and the duty faithfully to execute the law. Duty has translated to power by the tradition of the office. I am not quite sure how that happened.Youngstown Sheet and Tube tells us, or it begins to discuss, the critical question, whether or not the President is simply the agent of Congress, bound to do its bidding in all instances, or whether or not there is a core of power that lies at the center of the presidential office that the Congress cannot take away.As I understand current doctrine, and the Youngstown case, there is that core of power. The extent to which it can be exercised in defiance of the congressional will is a question of abiding concern, I know, to the Congress and to the judges.My point in those remarks was that these power zones are perhaps best defined as each branch accommodates the other, and expresses deference to the legitimate concerns of the other branch.The history of the development of the presidency has been one of evolution. One suggestion given for the different textual treatment in article II was that the framers knew that Washington would be the president. They trusted him, indicating that the framers thought there would be an evolutionary component to the presidency as it evolved.The extent to which the presidency can be controlled by the courts is not yet clear. We know that in the Youngstown case, where the president seized the steel mills, and in the Nixon tapes case, where the President was ordered to turn the tapes over to the prosecutor, there was immediate compliance by the president with the mandate of the Court.To date, the court's authority to review the acts of the president has not been questioned by the president. Lincoln questioned the authority, because of the necessity of the Civil War.Whether or not the courts are the appropriate body for the reconciliation of all of the disputes between the political branches of the government is a question as to which I have some doubt. In some disputes, it may be unclear there is a case and controversy which the courts can adequately and meaningfully interpret consistent with the case-by-case method.

NO, sir, I have not. It has been an issue that has arisen principally in the District of Columbia circuit. It is an issue on which I have not expressed myself, and have no particular fixedviews, other than, as I have indicated, to state that one of the reasons for a case and controversy requirement is to recognize the limitations of the judicial office.When President Truman seized the steel mills, this was an act that took place at a fixed time. It was like a taking under the fifth amendment. It was something that the court could very manageably work with. And they gave an important pronouncement in that case.It is a case that still has puzzles to it, but it is one of the leading cases on presidential power. That was a circumstance that had fixed boundaries, both as to time and to space, and the actions of the participants involved. That is the kind of case that the court can very manageably undertake.

I am not sure how you can be satisfied that a judge will not overstep the Constitutional bounds. What you must do is, number one, examine the judge's record; document his or her qualifications and commitment to constitutional rule. As I think Mr. Justice Jackson said, judges are not there because they are infallible; they are infallible because they are there. I think that comment is somewhat inappropriate. I do not think judges think of themselves as infallible at any point. Certainly the history of the Supreme Court in which the Court has been willing to recognize its errors and to overrule its decisions, indicates that the justices take very conscientiously their duty to interpret the Constitution in the appropriate way. 

That, Senator, is one of the great concerns of any scholar of the Constitution. This is not the aristocracy of the robe. Judges are not to make laws; they are to enforce the laws. This is particularly true with reference to the Constitution. The judges must be bound by some neutral, definable, measurable standard in their interpretation of the Constitution. 

The framers, because they wrote a constitution, I think well understood that it was to apply to exigencies and circumstances and perhaps even crises that they could never foresee.So any theory which is predicated on the intent the framers had what they actually thought about, is just not helpful.Then you can go one step further on the progression and ask, well, should we decide the problem as if the framers had thought about it? But that does not seem to me to be very helpful either.What I do think is that we can follow the intention of the framers in a different sense. They did do something. They made certain public acts. They wrote. They used particular words. They wanted those words to be followed.We can see from history more clearly now, I think, what the framers intended, than if we were sitting back in 1789. I made that discovery when I gave the speech to the Canadian judges.They had just written a constitution 2 or 3 years ago. They knew the draftsmen. And yet, they were, it seemed to me, more at sea as to what it meant than we were in interpreting our own Constitution.We have a great benefit, Senator, in that we have had 200 years of history. History is not irrelevant. History teaches us that the framers had some very specific ideas.As we move further away from the framers, their ideas seem almost more pure, more clarified, more divorced from the partisan politics of their time than before.So a study of the intentions and the purposes and the statements and the ideas of the framers, it seems to me, is a necessary starting point for any constitutional decision.

The judge must constantly be on guard against letting his or her biases or prejudices or affections enter into the judicial process.

The whole idea of judicial independence, the whole reason that judges are not accountable to the Congress once they're confirmed, other than for misbehavior, the whole theory is that the judge is impartial; that he will apply a law, or that shewill apply a law, that is higher than themselves. It is higher than their own particular predilections.

When a judge hears a constitutional case, a judge gets an understanding of the Constitution from many sources: from arguments of counsel; from the nature of the injuries and the claims asserted by the particular person; and from the reading of the precedents of the court, and the writings of those who studied the Constitution.All of these factors are, in essence, voices through which the Constitution is being heard.But the idea is that the Constitution is itself a law. It is a document that must be followed.

A conservative recognizes that any State must contain within it the ability to change in order to preserve those values that a conservative deems essential.As applied to a judge, I think that is consistent with the idea that constitutional values are intended to endure from generation to generation and from age to age.

I think what I had in mind there was to indicate that the doctrine of original intent is not necessarily helpful as a way to proceed in evaluating a case; but that really it is one of the things that we want to know.The doctrine of original intent does not tell us how to decide a case. Intention, though, is one of the objectives of our inquiry.If we know what the framers intended in the broad sense that I have described, then we have a key to the meaning of the document.I just did not think that original intent was very helpful as a methodology, as a way of proceeding, because it just restates the question.

Let me see if I—if you cannot find the original intent, is that your point?

Original intent, broadly conceived as I have described it, is extant in far more cases than we give it credit for.I think that in very many cases, the ideas, the values, the principles, the rules set forth by the framers, are a guide to the decision. And I think they are a guide that is sufficiently sure that the public and the people accept the decisions of the court as being valid for that reason.If there is not some historical link to the ideas of the framers, then the constitutional decision, it seems to me, is in some doubt.

Well, I do not wish to resist your line of questioning, because I think it is very important; it goes to the judicial method. But I think that in almost all cases there is an intent, at least broadly stated; the question is whether it is narrow enough to decide the particular case.It is, I think, an imperative that a judge who announces a constitutional rule be quite confident, be quite confident, that it has an adequate basis in our system of constitutional rule; and that means an adequate basis in the intention of the Constitution.

I resist that idea as a proper constitutional approach. In my view, it is the duty of the legislative and of the executive to act in a constitutional manner, and to make a constitutional judgment as to the validity of each and every one of their actions.We have a rule in the courts that we presume that a statute is constitutional. If the legislature says, well, it is simply up to the courts, the basis for that presumption is not there. If the legislature does not take the responsibility of making a constitutional determination that its actions are justified, then the presumption of constitutionality should be destroyed. I do not think that would be consistent with our political system.

I think judicial restraint is important in any era. It is especially important if the political branches for somereason think that they can delegate or have delegated the power to make constitutional decisions entirely to the courts.

Yes. 

It is very clear. The court's role is to sustain and to enforce that law. 

Absolutely, Senator. The essence of the democratic process is that the legislature protects citizens against unjust laws, and acts promptly to repeal them. 

If a law is wrong-headed, or a bad, or an ill-conceived law, but is nevertheless constitutional, the court has no choice but to enforce it. 

The unrestrained exercise of judicial power is to declare laws unconstitutional merely because of a disagreement with their wisdom. 

Yes. 

The underpinning for the doctrine of Marbury v. Madison is that the court pronounces on the Constitution because it has no other choice. It is faced with a case, and it must decide the case one way or the other. It cannot avoid that responsibility, and so the constitutional question is necessarily presented to it. Chief Justice Marshall says that very clearly. He said we do not have the responsibility, or the institutional capability, or the constitutional obligation, to pronounce on the Constitution, except as we must in order to decide a case. Now I had long thought that the case or controversy requirement therefore was an important limit on the court's jurisdiction. The court would not decide cases or issues that should be properly addressed by the political branches in the first instance. But the case or controversy rules are changing. The Court has relaxed rules of standing in some of its own decisions. The Congress has done the same. We have class actions. We have remedialrelief. Courts have entered the 20th century in order to make their judgments efficient, which they must do, and their systems efficient, which they must do.All of this has meant that what was once a selection process has now really diminished in its importance and its significance. The courts are more and more confronted with cases that involve the great, current public issues of our time.Therefore, judicial restraint is all the more an imperative. 

Well, that is a very delicate question, Senator. The authority of the Congress to reduce the jurisdiction of the federal courts in a particular class of cases presents a very difficult, and, I think, a significant constitutional question. It presents a question that goes perhaps to the verge of the congressional power. Before the Congress would enact such a rule, I would submit that it would have to have the most serious and the most compelling of reasons, and even after that any such attempt would present a serious constitutional issue for the Court itself to decide. 

Case or controversy is requisite in the Constitution and I agree that the Court should be very, very careful to insure that that requirement is met in every case, and I think it should pay very, very close attention to that.

I may also have misinterpreted your earlier question. Congress certainly can relax the rules of standing, or tighten the rules of standing, in order to give more content to the case or controversy rule without

Yes. 

I would not quarrel with that characterization. I might be a little bit hard-put to give you a specific example, but there seems to be a thrust in favor of the courts reaching out to decide the issues.

I think if a judge decides a case because he or she is committed to a result, it destroys confidence in the legal system.Senators and Representatives are completely free to vote for a particular bill because it favors labor, or because it favors business. That is the way politics works, and that is your prerogative. To identify such an interest, it seems to me, is very candid.That is improper for a court. The court must base its decision on neutral principles applicable to all parties. That is inconsistent, in my view, with deciding a case because it reaches a particular result.Now we all know that the way we make our judgments in everyday life is to look quickly at a result and act accordingly if the result seems instinctively correct.I think sometimes judges do that initially when they hear a case. They say well, this case is just wrong, or this case is just right. But the point of the judicial method is that after the judge identifies the result, he or she must go back and make sure that that result is reachable because the law requires the result, and not otherwise.

I insist that a result is irrelevant. I just have to tell you that many judges have an instinctive feeling for a case, and sometimes you reason backwards.Sometimes you say the case ought to come out this way and you begin to write it, and to prepare an opinion for your colleagues, and it just is not working, and then you know that the result is wrong.That is the nature of the judicial method. That is why we write. We do not write because it is easy to read, or because we think people enjoy reading it. We write because it is a discipline on our own process.

I think that the constitutional doctrine that is announced should be no broader than necessary to decide the case at hand.I do have to tell you this, Senator, and it was touched on earlier. When the Supreme Court has only 150 cases a year, and it is charged with the responsibility of supervising the lower courts, it has to write with a somewhat broader brush, in order to indicate what its reasons are.This does not mean, however, that it is free to go beyond the facts of the particular case, or that it is free to embellish upon the constitutional standard.

Thank you, sir. 

Not at all. I am here at the pleasure of the committee, Senator. 

Thank you very much, Senator.

Thank you, Senator. 

It is more interesting than some of my sessions, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator. I certainly understand. 

Well, in answering that question, let me say that implicit in your introduction was the proposition that it was not the framers' intent to forbid segregation in schools, and 1 think Professor Burger has 180 degrees the wrong slant on that point. He defines intent ii a. v«ry narrow way. He defines intent to mean what the framers, as he AU them, actually thought.I think that is irrelevant. What is important are the public acts that accompr nj> d the ratification of, in this case, the 14th amendment. Reme^nber that the framers are not the sole repository from which we discover the necessary intention and the necessary purpose. In the legislature we do not ask what the staff person thought when he or she wrote the bill, we ask what the Senators thought.And so with the Constitution. It is what the legislatures thought they were doing and intended and said when they ratified these amendments.The whole lesson of our constitutional experience has been that a people can rise above its own injustice, that a people can rise above the inequities that prevail at a particular time. The framers of the Constitution originally, in 1789, knew that they did not live in a perfect society, but they promulgated the Constitution anyway. They were willing to be bound by its consequences.In my view, the 14th amendment was intended to eliminate discrimination in public facilities on the day that it was passed because that is the necessary meaning of the actions that were taken and of the announcements that were made. You can read the abolitionist writings that were the precursor to so much of the 14th amendment. So, that, as Professor Berger states, the framers did not have it in mind at the time or that they knew they had a segregated school system, is irrelevant.

SO with that preface, we then come to the next part of your question: Can the court ever decide a case contrary to intent? I just wanted to make it clear that I somewhat disagree with the thesis that you interjected at the outset because I think Brown v. Board of Education was right when it was decided, and I think it would have been right if it had been decided 80 years before. I think Plessy v. Ferguson was wrong on the day it was decided.

Well, number one, I not only should expand on it, I should probably correct it. It is highly relevant what the framers thought. But the general inquiry, the principal inquiry, should be on the official purpose, the official intent as disclosed by the amendment. In looking at legislative history to determine the meaning of Congress, we sometimes find statements made on the floor of the Senate or the floor of the House that seem almost at variance with the purpose of the legislation when viewed overall as an institutional matter. I am applying that same rule here.With reference to framers, I and many others use "framers" in a rather loose sense. I think obviously we want to know what Madison and Hamilton thought, and the other draftsmen of the Constitution. But theirs is not the entire body of contemporary opinion and contemporary expression that we look to.In my view, for instance, the abolitionist writings are critical to an understanding of the 14th amendment. It was in response to their concerns that that amendment was enacted.

Yes. 

Well, I am not saying that the official purpose, the announced intention, the fundamental theory of the amendment as adopted will in all cases be the sole determinant. But I think I am indicating that it has far more force and far more validity and far more breadth than simply what someone thought they were doing at the time. I just do not think that the 14th amendment was designed to freeze into society all of the inequities that then existed. I simply cannot believe it. 

That is true, and I think maybe many Senators felt at the time they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that they lived in a society that did not comply in all respects with what the statute required them to do. They were willing to make a statement that society should be changed. The Constitution is the preeminent example of our people making such a statement. 

Well, I do not want to put us in a deeper trench, because I think there is an element of agreement between us. But I must insist that the intention of the 14th amendment is much more broad than you seem to state in the predicate for all of your questions. 

It was very clear to me that the purpose of the 14th amendment was to effect racial equality in public facilities in this country.

It was very clear from the abolitionist writings; it was very clear from some of the statements on the floor; and it is abundantly clear from the text of the language, which admits of no exception, in my view. I think the framers were willing to be bound by the consequences of their words. And their words are sweeping, and their words are very important and they have great power. 

NO. Those who addressed the amendment specified their purpose in much broader, much more general terms. I think that they were willing to be bound by the consequences of what they did and the consequences of what they wrote. And I think Plessy v. Ferguson was wrong the day it was decided on that basis. 

But that cannot be because society changed between 1878 and 1896. 

Well, I agreed with you until your last statement, because I think what the framers had in mind was to rise above their own injustices. It would serve no purpose to have a Constitution which simply enacted the status quo. 

And, incidentally, we should note for the record that Mr. Justice Harlan was there in 1896, and he dissented in Plessy. Plessy was not a unanimous decision. The first Mr. Justice Harlan. 

Well, you know, it sometimes takes humans generations to become aware of the moral consequences, or the immoral consequences, of their own conduct. That does not mean that moral principles have not remained the same.

Certainly, Senator. 

All right. You are talking about quite a few things here.Let me say at the outset that it is somewhat difficult for me to offer myself as someone with a complete cosmology of the Constitution. I do not have an over-arching theory, a unitary theory of interpretation. I am searching, as I think many judges are, for the correct balance in constitutional interpretation. So many of the things we are discussing here are, for me, in the nature of exploration and not the enunciation of some fixed or immutable ideas.Once again, we must be very careful to note that when we speak of intent we speak on many different levels. The fact that the framers never thought of an ICC is not entirely relevant. The question is whether or not an administrative agency can and does fit within the principles that the framers announced for separation of powers.Now, the position of administrative agencies in a system in which the Constitution mandates the separation of powers—legislative, executive, and judicial—has not been clearly established in the case law. Much work needs to be done there. It seems to me that the Government of the United States could have hardly survived without those agencies, and that may itself be a strong argument for the fact that they are legitimate, given what the framers promulgated. But that whole area of the law, as Professor Bator, I think, has described it, is a very unruly one. And I think, the courts have not really come to grips with how to explain the position of an administrative agency, that is, whether or not it is an appropriate exercise of article I power.Did I answer the question? 

Well, I think the American people would be very surprised if a judge announced that the Constitution enabled a judge to issue any decree necessary to achieve a just society. The Constitution simply is not written that way. And I think it is an exercise in fair disclosure to the American people, and to the political representatives of the Government, to make it very clear that the duty to provide a just society is not one that can be undertaken solely by the judiciary.I indicated yesterday there is no truly just or truly effective constitutional system in the very broad sense of that term—constitutional with a small "c"—if there is hunger, if there are inadequate educational opportunities, if there is poor housing. It is not clear to me that the Constitution addresses those matters.

Well, I am pleased to talk with you about that case, Senator. I found it a very troubling case and still do.You began by saying that in that case I found that the constitutional rights of the Hispanic community to vote were not violated.

YOU began by saying that in that case I found the constitutional right to vote of Hispanics in the community were not violated. That was precisely what I was concerned about. It was precisely what I did not find. It is precisely why I wrote a separate opinion.In this case, the plaintiffs, who were residents of the city of San Fernando in Southern California, brought a challenge to the atlarge system of voting, and they asked for the remedy of a federal court decree to require district voting—the purpose being so that Hispanics could have representation in the city government. Although I forget the facts of the case, I will assume that there were neighborhoods which were largely Hispanic. I think that is probably implicit in the facts of the case. So they would have achieved that had that remedy been granted.The lower court found the evidence insufficient to state a cause of action and granted summary judgment. My two colleagues on the court agreed. I felt that there was something wrong in that case. So I undertook to write a separate opinion to express my concerns.I went through the evidence and brought out the fact that voting booths were located in non-Hispanic neighborhoods, that there had been no representation on city commissions and boards, et cetera. I indicated that these facts might very well support an action for relief in the federal courts.In that case, however—and you are never sure why lawyers and litigants frame the cases the way they do—the insistence by the plaintiffs was that they wanted only the one remedy of a district election scheme rather than an at-large election scheme. That is the only remedy they sought.This is one of the most powerful, one of the most sweeping, one of the most far-reaching kinds of remedies that the federal court can impose on a local system. And in our view, or in my view as expressed in the concurrence, that remedy far exceeded the specific wrongs that had been alleged. I concluded that the remedy sought did not match the violation established. But I made it very clear— and that was the point of my opinion in what I still consider trou-bling and a very close case—I had a serious concern that individual rights violations had been established in the record.What was the outcome of that case, whether a subsequent suit was brought based on my concurring opinion, I do not know. My concurring opinion is a textbook for an amended complaint, or a textbook for a new action. I tried to indicate my concerns and my sensitivities in that case rather than simply joining in the majority opinion, which I thought did not adequately address some very real violations.

Well, I thought that that was implicit if not explicit in my opinion. I was writing a concurring opinion. I did not have the second vote, so I could not order—I could not frame the judgment in the case.

Or to the finder of fact. 

Well, remember, number one, I just don't have the judgment. But so far as my own separate concurring opinion, why didn't I recommend that, I guess would be your question.

That is a fair question, and I am not sure I have an adequate answer in my own memory—now.As I recall the case, we explored the case with counsel extensively at oral argument. And counsel said, "This is a case in which all we are seeking is an abolition of at-large elections. That is all this case is about." And that was my concern.Why clients and attorneys present cases in this way is beyond me. It was very clear to me, based on my understanding of the record, that any Hispanic resident could bring an action to change the places of the polling booths and to rectify the other injustices that were there in the system.158 Now, under the—well, I'm not an expert in the amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1980, I haven't had cases on those. At this time, we were operating under the assumption that the remedy had to fit the wrong, and that was the argument that I had with the attorneys in the case. But I wanted to make it very clear in the concurring opinion that I was concerned with the treatment that the court was giving to these litigants, and I wanted to put on the record that I thought there was some evidence of discrimination. And I guess, Senator Kennedy, the answer to your question of why didn't it go to the finder of fact, is because the attorneys insisted that this was all the suit was about, at-large versus district elections. I just did not see that as a plausible remedy, as a permissible remedy, given the violations they had established. 

Well, it brings up the troubling point that I have not resolved, Senator: To what extent can courts try lawsuits for the litigants. In this case, as I recall, these were extremely experienced, capable attorneys. 

And for me to say, well, now, you have done this the wrong way, you go back, when they insisted they did not want to do that, it seems to me is perhaps overstepping. 

Well, but it is not clear to me that the court should, if the litigants insist that this is all they are asking for. 

And the whole point of the decision was that I did not want Hispanics to think that I did not think there were some serious problems down there in San Fernando. 

I would be glad to address it, Senator. We must at the outset distinguish between equal pay and comparable pay. The Congress of the United States has a statute which says that women and men in the same positions are to be given the same pay. That is not what this case was about. That law is clear; that policy is clear; that obligation is clear; and the courts enforce that. That is not what this case was. What this case was about was a theory that women should be paid the same as men for different jobs. The theory of the case was that the State of Washington was under an obligation to adopt this differential pay scale or a compensatory pay scale, because it had notice of the fact that there were pay disparities based on long classifications and stereotypes of women in particular jobs. I understand that. You do not have to be married to a school teacher for very long to figure out that the reasons educators are not paid enough in this country is because for hundreds of years the education system has been borne on the backs of women. They have borne the brunt of it. And I think you can make a pretty clear inference that the reason for those low pay scales is because women have dominated that profession. I think that is very unfortunate.On the other hand, it is something of a leap to say that every school district in the country is in violation of title VII because it does not adopt a system whereby you find comparable worth and lower the salaries of drivers of equipment which, say, are male dominated jobs—let's assume they are—and raise the salaries of women.That may be a commendable result but, number one, we did not see in title VII that Congress had mandated that result, or in the Equal Pay Act. We looked very carefully at the legislative history.Second, we did not see, in the evidence presented to us, that the State of Washington had intentionally discriminated by continuing to use the market system in effect.The State of Washington was subject to a judgment for $800 million, which I take it is a large amount of money, perhaps even in Washington, DC, on the theory that their failing to depart from the market system and from market forces was an actionable violation.Now, the Governor recognized—I forget if it was the Governor or the legislature or both—that in their view, the State as an affirmative matter should undertake this correction.We did not think, however, that there was a shred of evidence to show that the State had deliberately maintained that pay scale difference in order to discriminate against women.It is true that the State had in the past advertised for some job categories as male only. And the State had corrected that.Once again, I guess we are talking about the difference between the wrong and the remedy.

We held not. We held that under that formula—it appeared to me, it appears to me, that under that formula, every employer in the United States is charged with an intentional discrimination because it follows the market system even though it did not create that market system.

I am absolutely committed to enforcing congressional policy to eliminate barriers that discriminate against women, particularly in employment or in the market place or in any other area where it is presented to me.We do not have a free society when those barriers exist. We do not have a free society if women cannot command pay that is calculated without reference to the fact that they are of a particular sex.But it is simply not clear to me at all that the State of Washington, because it undertakes a survey and discovers what is intuitive for many people, that some job classifications are dominated by women and that they are paid less, can be held to be a violator for not correcting that.I think the State should be commended for undertaking the study. If the holding were that any employer who undertakes a study of comparable worth is liable for failing to correct the inequity—I simply don't think that the Congress has let the courts go that far.If the Congress wants to enact that, I will enforce it. If the Congress has not enacted it, I cannot as a judge invent it.

Well, it is an important case, Senator, and I do not mind talking about it. A couple of final points. First, my understanding is that every other court in the country that has looked at the issue has reached the same result. Second, we indicated that in a case where you can establish that the wage scales were set because women were dominant in the pay group, there could be an actionable violation, of course.We made that very clear. We did not find it on this evidence. 

Yes. 

It was unanimous. 

Yes, sir. 

I am fully satisfied with the decision of the Supreme Court. I should note that in Kaiser the implication of the employees was that the employer was supporting their policy position. And the employer's decision to discharge was based on a theory that the engineers had misrepresented the employer's position.But as for the rule that the Supreme Court has announced, I have absolutely no trouble with. And I think it is a good rule.

It is very clear to me that the unions of this country are entitled to full and generous enforcement of the national labor relations laws that protect their activities.The box score here I am not quite familiar with. It is a fundamental matter of national policy that workers are protected in their right to organize, and in their right to collective bargaining.And in my view, I have fully and faithfully interpreted the law in that regard. I have great admiration for working people. I worked through all kinds of jobs when I was working my way through school.Since I was 14 or 15 years old I had jobs with manual laborers. I learned that they had a great deal of wisdom and a great deal of compassion, and that their rights should be protected by bargaining agents.

Thank you. 

Thank you, sir. 

Thank you very much, sir. 

Certainly, Senator, I do. 

I pointed out at one time in yesterday's hearings that I am not sure whether it is a semantic quibble or not. I think that the concept of liberty in the due process clause is quite expansive, quite sufficient, to protect the values of privacy that Americans legitimately think are part of their constitutional heritage. It seems to me that sometimes by using some word that is not in the Constitution, we almost create more uncertainties than we solve. It is very clear that privacy is a most helpful noun, in that it seems to sum up rather quickly values that we hold very deeply.

I really think I would like to draw the line and not talk about the Griswold case so far as its reasoning or its result. I would say that if you were going to propose a statute or a hypothetical that infringed upon the core values of privacy that the Constitution protects, you would be hard put to find a stronger case than Griswold. 

Yes—pardon, is there a 

Marital right to privacy; that is what I thought you said. Yes, sir.

The Beller v. Middendorf case was one where we examined it and discussed it extensively. The case we discussed yesterday. And I'm tempted to say that is the only one. 

We tried, I tried, in the Beller case, to understand what the Supreme Court's doctrine was in the area of substantive due process protection, and came to the conclusion, as stated in the opinion, that the Supreme Court has recognized that there is a substantive component to the due process clause. I was willing to assume that for the purposes of that opinion. I think that is right. I think there is a substantive component to the due process clause. 

Yes. 

And I think the value of privacy is a very important part of that substantive component. 

Well, I would be very careful about saying that a judge should make representations to the committee that he immediately renounces when he goes on the court.

Yes. 

I think you would expect that evolution to take place. And with reference to the right of privacy, we are very much in a stage of evolution and debate.I think that the public and the legislature have every right to contribute to that debate. The Constitution is made for that kind of debate.The Constitution is not weak because we do not know the answer to a difficult problem. It is strong because we can find that answer.Now it takes time to find it, and the judicial method is slow. 

It is the gradual process of inclusion and exclusion, as Mr. Justice Cardozo called it. And it may well be that we are still in a very rudimentary state of the law so far as the right of privacy is concerned. If you had a nominee 20 years ago for the Supreme Court of the United States, and you asked him or her what does the first amendment law say with reference to a State suit based on defamation against a newspaper, not the most gifted prophet could have predicted the course and the shape and the content of the law today. And we may well be there with reference to some of these other issues that we are discussing. 

That is correct. I was quite willing to posit that the framers did not give courts authority to create a just society. 

Yes, sir.

Mostly affirmative government action, although the Supreme Court in a case, Plyler v. Doe, held that the State of Texas could not altogether deprive illegal aliens of education.

SO even here there is an area for the courts to participate in. 

The equal protection jurisprudence makes that rather clear. 

Well, I would think so, yes. 

My point about the unwritten constitution, I suppose, has been to try to explain how that term was used by early political philosophers. Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, all talked about the constitution. And what they meant was, the whole fabric of a society. As you know, there are something like 160 written constitutions in the world today. Very few of them work like ours does. And yet their terms in some cases are just as eloquent, and perhaps even more eloquent. Their terms are somewhat more far-reaching in the grant of the positive entitlements that we have talked about, the right to adequate housing, food, shelter. But they do not work. The reason ours works is because the American people do have a shared vision. And I think important in that shared vision is the idea that each man and woman has the freedom and the capacity to develop to his or her own potential. That is somewhat different than the Constitution states it, but I think all Americans believe that. And I think that has a strong and a very significant pull on the legislature and on the courts. 

NO. But, again, this is the consensus that our society has that makes it work. One of the great landmark 

Well, I hope they square. 

Absent an abiding respect by the people for the judgments of the court, the judgments of the court will not work. And the Constitution does not work if any one branch of the Government insists on the exercise of its powers to the extreme. One of the great landmarks in constitutional history was when President Truman complied within the hour with the Supreme Court's order to turn back the steel mills. President Nixon did the same thing with the tapes. That is what makes the Constitution work. The Constitution fails when a governor stands in front of the courthouse with troops to prevent the integration of the schools subject to a Supreme Court order. The Constitution does not work very well when that happens. 

Yes. 

I do not think so. I think courts have the obligation always to remind themselves of their own fallibility in this regard. They have the obligation to announce their judgments in neutral, logical, accepted terms that are consistent with the judicial method. And the courts have, of course, the obligation to respect the legislative branch. Your example of the President leaving office is probably a better example than any one that I have thought of on this mystic idea of this unwritten constitution. I think it is an important example; it is a good one. 

NO. The courts, except in perhaps rare instances, have never shrunk from their duty to interpret the Constitution and they never should. But as you indicate, one of the reallygreat ironies of our system is that a branch of the Government that is not supposed to be political in nature has historically resolved disputes of great political consequences. One of the great issues for the first 30 years in this country was whether or not Congress had the right to establish a national bank. And the Supreme Court stepped right into the middle of that—and fairly early in the controversy—and it has not been successful in extricating itself since.But the point is that a court must recognize that its function is not a political function; it is a judicial one. We manipulate different symbols. We apply different standards.

Well, rather than comment specifically on the opinion, I would say that right of access generally is an important part of the first amendment and is properly enforced by the courts.Should I wait? 

In the DeLorean case, incidentally, the question was whether or not newspapers could inspect sentencing documents. 

I am not so sure that it is that expansive. 

That the press is allowed to be at trial? 

Well, I think perhaps we could characterize it as an expansive reading. 

I think a very powerful case can be made for the legitimacy of that decision. 

Yes. Meyer v. Nebraska has a whole catalogue of rights that the Supreme Court thought were fundamental, some of them quite expansive—the right to pursue happiness. The first amendment, it seems to me, has tremendous substantive force and can easily justify the result in Meyer and Pierce.

NO. The Supreme Court at that time, I think, was essentially unaware of the expansive nature of its first amendment decisions. Those cases were 1916. Well, the laws were passed in 1916, and then it took a few more years to get up to the court.

Well, my point was that the statements in the opinion, the broad statements of the opinion, I was not sure could support a whole body of jurisprudence.

Did they 

Again, I think that most Americans think that they have those rights, and I hope that they do. Whether or not they are fully enforceable by the courts in those specific terms is a matter that remains open.

Well, it is not clear to me that each and every one of the rights set forth in Meyer can sustain a complaint for relief in a federal court. I would be very puzzled if I received a complaint that alleged that the plaintiff was denied his right to happiness.

Well, there is a whole list of things, and one problem with the list is that it may not sound exhaustive enough. But, essentially, we look to the concepts of individuality and liberty and dignity that those who drafted the Constitution understood. We see what the hurt and the injury is to the particular claimant who is asserting the right. We see whether or not the right has been accepted as part of the rights of a free people in the historical interpretation of our own Constitution and the intentions of the framers.Those are the kinds of things you look at, but it is hardly an exhaustive list. You, of course, must balance that against the rights asserted by the State, of which there are many.

I think that the judge, in assessing what the society expects of the law, must give that great weight rather than his or her own personal views.

Well, I wish I could give a good, clear answer to the question. I think in that same speech I said in frustration, "Come out, come out, wherever you are", looking for the sources and the definitions of unenumerated rights.You look in large part to the history of our own law. This is what stare decisis is all about. You look to see how the great Justices that have sat on the Court for years have understood and interpreted the Constitution, and from that you get a sense of what the Constitution really means.An English representative in the House of Commons once said that "History is Philosophy teaching by example"; and I think that the law can be described the same way.

It causes me some apprehension, some awe. No jurist, no lawyer, no nominee could aspire to be on the Court that was occupied by Holmes and Brandeis and Cardozo and the two Harlans and Black, not to mention the great Marshall, without some of those feelings.On the other hand, the very fact that those judges were there and that they wrote what they did gives the Constitution and thejudicial system great strength and great power. It enables the judge to continue to explore for the meaning of the Constitution. That is what I wish to do.If you had a visitor coming to this country, and he asked: What is it that makes America unique? What is the gift that we have for civilization? What is it that America has done for history? I think most people would say America is committed to the Constitution and to the rule of law. And I have that same commitment.

Yes, Senator; for better or worse.

I enjoyed it. I want to make clear that I never speak from notes.

I gave the Senate what notes I had. I think that speech came out about that way. 

One of the dangers is you sometimes forget the principal part of the speech until after you have given it. 

That is a correct quote, and I think it is a correct concept. 

NO, sir. 

Certainly not. 

Well, as I indicated yesterday, the meaning of the ninth amendment, and even its purpose, is shrouded in doubt, and the Court has not, in my view, found it necessary to refer to that amendment in order to stake out the protections for liberty and for human rights that it has done so far in its history. 

Yes. There may be some quarrel with that statement because of an isolated reference by Mr. Justice Douglas in the Griswold case, and by the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Goldberg in the same case. 

I suppose the Court can cry in protest if it sees an injustice in a particular case. The law is an ethical profession, and the law is designed to seek justice.And if courts see an injustice being done, I think the oath of our profession requires us to bring that to the attention of the Congress. On the other hand, judges who are appointed for life cannot use the judiciary as a platform for their own particular views. So there is a duality there.

Well, from time to time, in our opinions we tell the Congress, please look at this statute and see the way we are enforcing it. Do you really want us to do this? I think that is quite a legitimate function of the Court.I have said that in some of the RICO cases. Some of my other colleagues have, too. It is just not at all clear to us that the way we are enforcing RICO is what Congress really had in mind, but we are following where the words lead us.

My characterization was what I thought the philosophy of the Court was to date, and I think it is important that the Court not confront such an ultimate and difficult issue unless it has to.A case grounded solely on the ninth amendment requires the judge to search in the very deep recesses of the law, where I am not sure there are any answers.

I think there is a concern in society that the courts sometimes reach results simply because the courts think in their own view that those results are right, and I think it is extremely important for judges to remember that they are not political officers in black robes.On the other hand, I think it is also important for the public to know the limitations of our own powers. Perhaps the public is, from time to time, disappointed with the cases that we write.Perhaps the public thinks that we should reach out to rectify an injustice, to amend a complaint, to change a lawyer's theory of the case, and the constraints of the judicial process simply do not always allow that.

These were judges from Canada who have a new constitution.

They had been under a parliamentary system where the legislative authority is supreme, as have the English judges for many, many years, and they were curious to know what the extent of their authority was. And I think it fair to say most of them were looking forward to exercising it, and therefore, I was sounding a note of caution. 

I think it is always a legitimate concern, and that we must remind ourselves, constantly, of the limitations on our authority. 

There are a few cases where it is very safe to say that they did, the Dred Scott case being the paradigmatic example of judicial excess. 

I did not really have a list of cases in mind. I had more in mind an approach, an attitude that I sometimes see reflected on the bench. 

That I sometimes see reflected on the bench in my own court. 

Yes, and this can affect the decisional course of the court. 

That is correct. None come immediately to mind. But that concern always underlies the examination by ajudge of his own writings, or her own writings, and of the writings of their colleagues.It is something you must constantly be aware of as you are trying to evaluate the pulls and tugs, and the impulses and the constraints that come to bear on the decisional process.

Well, I do not think the judiciary of the United States, as a whole, has departed from its mandate or its authority, but I simply think it is a concern that must always remain in the open, so that judges are aware of the limitations on their authority.

Yes. There is a case called Dudgeon, decided by the European Court of Human Rights, under the Convention of Human Rights, and it reached a result that was absolutely contrary to Bowers v. Hardwick, and as I indicated in the speech, the Supreme Court had enough to wrestle with with its own precedents without trying to incorporate the European court. But I thought that it was an interesting exercise to compare the European court case with the Bowers case.

And the answer is the comparison was between the Dudgeon case and the Bowers case. 

Well, the methodology of the cases, it seems to me, are nol easy to square, although that is nothing to be particularly upset about. The law accommodates a certain amount of contradiction and duality while it is in a state of growth. Absent a perfect society, justice and symmetry are not synonymous. 

I think I said duality and tension. I do not know. 

Well, between the idea and the reality falls the shadow. We attempt, of course, to have symmetry. We attempt, of course, to have cases that are all on fours with each other. To the extent they are not, that indicates that the court has further work to do. 

I would agree with that, Senator. I think that is perhaps the correct resolution—objectivity. 

Madison said if men were angels we would not need a Constitution. 

Well, I had read extensively in preparing for this opinion, in order to understand the right approach, and I usually think it is fair to the parties to set forth the things that I have read. This was the first case involving a challenge to the discharge of homosexuals from the military, and I spent a great deal of time on it, and I thought it important for the reader, and for the litigants to know that I had considered their point of view. 

Well, it is interesting that the legal profession is the only profession that is intimidated by its initiates. We have law review articles written by students who are not even lawyers and they get paid a great deal of attention, I guess that is one thing that keeps the law vigorous and vital. But I am not overly persuaded by academic comment. I frankly do not have time to read very much of it. 

I think it is the prerogative and the responsibility of the political branch to take the leadership there. As I have indicated yesterday, I think the political branch has the obligation to assess each of its actions under the standard of constitutionality, and I think when the Court confronts an act by a legislature, it must know, it must recognize that the legislators understood the Constitution, that they acted deliberately with reference to it, and the legislature is entitled to a high degree of deference.This is not just the political system at work. It is the constitutional system at work.

Absolutely. The judiciary system is responsible for the immediate supervision and the immediate implementation of the criminal system. The judiciary has itself made many of the rules that are binding upon the police, and it is the obligation of the judiciary to constantly reassess those rules as to their efficacy and as to their reasonableness.In this connection, we were talking about violent crime. We were talking about victims who feel helpless in the wake of crime, and courts must be very, very conscious of their front-line position here.

I think that it can in some quarters. Everybody can point the finger to each other, but I think the courts bear a large responsibility. I know in some States, some States represented by the members of this committee, there simply are not enough funds for courts, for law enforcement officials, for correctional facilities. And it is a tremendous problem.What we do is take care of society's failures. We have very little to do with preventative measures other than the deterrent value that quick and efficient enforcement of the criminal system brings.

Of course. 

I would include the Supreme Court, of course. 

Well, it was that court, of course, which implemented the great changes that we have had in the criminal procedure system, changes which are now really a part of that system. I was pointing out the fact that really there has been a lack of awareness by all parts of the Government of the position of the victim. I had indicated yesterday that victim was a word that I never even heard in law school, and, frankly, I do not think I heard of it until the last 6 or 7 years until the Congress of the United States and commentators brought it to our attention when you passed the Victims Assistance Act. 

Certainly. 

Well, as I have indicated, the intent is really much in doubt. My view was that Madison wrote it for two reasons. Well, they are really related. He knew, as did the other framers, that they were engaged on an enterprise where they occupied the stage of world history; not just the stage of legal history, but the stage of world history. These were famous, famous men even by the standards of a day unaccustomed to celebrities. And he was very, very careful to recognize his own fallibilities and his own limitations. So he first of all wanted to make it clear that the first eight amendments were not an exhaustive catalogue of all human rights. Second, he wanted to make it clear that State ratifying conventions, in drafting their own constitutions, could go much further90-878 0 - 8 9 - 7than he did. And the ninth amendment was in that sense a recognition of State sovereignty and a recognition of State independence and a recognition of the role of the States in defining human rights. That is why it is something of an irony to say that the ninth amendment can actually be used by a federal court to tell the State that it cannot do something. But the incorporation doctrine may lead to that conclusion, and that is the tension.

May. May lead to that conclusion. 

There are the whole catalogue of considerations that I have indicated, and any short list or even any attempt at an exhaustive list, I suppose, would take on the attributes of an argument for one side or the other. A very abbreviated list of the considerations are the essentials of the right to human dignity, the injury to the person, the harm to the person, the anguish to the person, the inability of the person to manifest his or her own personality, the inability of a person to obtain his or her own self-fulfillment, the inability of a person to reach his or her own potential. On the other hand, the rights of the State are very strong indeed. There is the deference that the Court owes to the democratic process, the deference that the Court owes to the legislative process, the respect that must be given to the role of the legislature, which itself is an interpreter of the Constitution, and the respect that must be given to the legislature because it knows the values of the people. 

The task of the judge is to try to find objective referents for each of those categories. 

Thank you, Senator. 

All right, Senator. 

I recognize the quotation that the Constitution is colorblind. It was, of course, in the context, as you point out, of a case in which affirmative action was not before the Court and has since been used, as an interpretation, to argue against affirmative action. I do not think that that is a necessary interpretation of the opinion. 

My agreement with Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent is his reasoning as he was applying it to the facts of Plessy v. Ferguson. 

The issue has not come before me in a judicial capacity as a circuit judge, and might well as a Supreme Court Justice, so I would not commit myself on the issue. I will say that my experience in law school taught me the arguments for the practice. 

My experience in law school taught me the arguments in favor of affirmative action. Whether or not they would prevail in a court of law on a constitutional basis is by no means certain. But, in the law schools, in 1965, one percent of the nation's law school student body was black. After 10 years of effort by the law schools, including the one where I was privileged to teach, to encourage applicants from the black community, that had risen to 8 percent, an 800 percent increase. I know of no professor in legal education that does not think that it is highly important that we have a representative group of black law students in law schools. It has apparently stayed about that rate, at 8 percent. I will notice in some of my classes there are not as many blacks as the year before, and then I will notice it picks up again. So, it is an area that the law schools, and I am sure other professional schools, are continuing to pay attention to, and I think it is a very important objective on the part of the schools. I recognize that in the area of State schools there are different kinds of programs that may present constitutional questions that have yet to be resolved fully by the Court. As you know, the Court is still engaged in determining the appropriate rationale and the appropriate explanation for affirmative action under the Constitution. 

AS you know, the leading case on the subject is Fullilove v. Klutznik, a Supreme Court case which ratified, validated an affirmative action program for minority hiring for government contracts. That case is quite sweeping in its reasoning and in its rationale. But again, this is an area of the law where there is still much exploration and much explanation to be done on a caseby-case basis. I am not sure if there is any such case on the docket of the Supreme Court this term, but I know there are some cases in the circuits.

Yes, and incidentally, I said that I have not written in this area. Perhaps that was imprecise. Your question brings to mind one case where we had a unanimous court and I was the author of the opinion. It was called Bates v. The Pacific Maritime Association, and the question was whether or not a consent decree, which in a sense is voluntary action, was binding on a successor employer.The previous employer had agreed to the terms and conditions of the consent decree and thereafter sold the enterprise. But the employee pool was the same, the equipment was the same, and we held that the consent decree, which required affirmative action for racial minority hiring, was valid and was binding on the successor. And you might be able to obtain some insight into my approach in this area by looking at that case.

Paul Brest is a great constitutional scholar and I wish he had answered the question. He did not.I thought when I first began teaching constitutional law that John Marshall was in the finest position of all of us to know what the Constitution meant, and in part because of my experience in talking about the Canadian Constitution with the Canadian judges I have changed that view. I think 200 years of history gives us a magnificent perspective on what the framers did intend, on what they did plan, on what they did build, on what they did structure for this country.Holmes said that "A page of history is worth a volume of logic," and certainly 200 years of history is not irrelevant, so I think we are in a better position. The answer is, I think we are in a much better position.And the other point is that over time the intentions of the framers are more remote from their particular political concerns and so they have a certain purity and a certain generality now that they did not previously.

Thank you very much, Senator. 

Not at all. I appreciate the Senator's most gracious remarks. 

Well, I know that it is yours, Senator, so I would be pleased to learn. 

I know that it is yours, so I would be pleased to learn. 

At the outset let me tell you, Senator, that I did not hear Judge Bork's testimony on that point and I am simply not familiar with his views. There is a case on the Supreme Court's docket, and I am not sure if it is one that has been argued this term, in which the question cf whether or not vertical price restraints, which is the kind of restraint that you have described, are per se violative of the antitrust laws. So I should tread very warily about expressing a view on that case.

I understand. I just wanted to tell you why I am going to be very guarded in my answer, because it is such a specific issue that the Supreme Court is now considering.Generally. I think it is fair to say, and I think that the law should be this, that a per se rule is justified if in almost every event it has an anticompetitive effect. Only if a particular trade practice that is challenged is pro-competitive is there a justification for it when there is a restrictive agreement of the kind you describe. I take it that is the starting position for analyzing this kind of problem.And so the question, I suppose, would be whether or not there can be any demonstration that vertical price restraints are in any respect pro-competitive, and it is not clear to me exactly what showing would be made on that. You can get economists to testify on each side of any issue, as you know.

That is the question. And, incidentally, by saying that economists testify on either side of the issue, I do not mean necessarily to denigrate them. There is just a great deal of disagreement, and we use experts in lawsuits this way all the time.

I thought it was a close case then, and I am quite willing to accept the Supreme Court's decision, although all of us were disappointed that there was not a majority in the Supreme Court—there were only four votes—because the district courts and the circuit courts need guidance and we wanted the Supreme Court to set the rule.My concern there was that I wanted a record. I wanted the case to go to trial. It simply wasn't clear to me from what I know as a judge, from what I am capable of understanding as a judge, that arrangements for health care services which use a pool of doctors and which allow the patient to choose the particular doctor are in all respects necessarily anti-competitive if they use a price schedule.

The issue, as I understood it, as framed by the plaintiffs, who were challenging the scheme, was whether allowing a health plan, where you have a choice of physicians and the physicians have a schedule that they agree upon, is necessarily anti-competitive. I simply saw no body of doctrine or learning or experience in the courts that would justify my coming to the conclusion that in all cases that must be anti-competitive.The health care field is sufficiently volatile and dynamic, and the cost problems in the health care field are so well understood that I thought that the courts could benefit from a trial where we could have experts testify one way or the other and then evaluate the record. It did not seem to me that the rules for fixing the prices of retail goods necessarily applied to the medical profession, which was attempting to provide this kind of group service.And the Supreme Court said, in the 4-to-3 opinion, that that was incorrect—that a horizontal price schedule is a horizontal price restraint, and that it is per se illegal.I recognize the utility of per se rules. Because if you have a rule of reason trial, which is usually at the other end of the spectrum, it is a global sort of judgment. It is a very expensive suit to try. The plaintiff has to go through an elaborate and costly trial, and, when the trial is over you often do not learn a lot. That is the argument against the rule of reason and the argument for per se rules.My concern was that in the health field—we knew so little about it that we should have a trial on the merits. But the Supreme Court disagreed, and I understand why.187 

Well, the Sherman Antitrust Acts and the Clayton Acts were passed in an era when corporate acquisitions and mergers were proceeding at a tremendous rate. In the period, I think, from 1900 to 1930, over 7,000 small firms, each with a capital of over $100,000, simply disappeared. The concern was, in the acquisitions and merger field, that the capitalistic system simply could not work if there was not an opportunity for small and medium-sized businesses to invest capital, to have resources and talent in localities throughout the country, and to have some protection against being acquired by competitors and by large conglomerates. This particularly happened in the utility area. Unfortunately, what happened was that the Supreme Court, in the E.C. Knight case, gave a restrictive interpretation under the Commerce Clause to the reach of the Sherman Act, and at the same time they were willing to enforce agreements against price restraints, and the two in combination accelerated this merger pace. And it was only when the Supreme Court changed its rules under the Commerce Clause that antitrust enforcement became a reality in the merger field. So I think it is necessary to go back to that intent of Congress and to recognize that it is a central part of our national policy to have a capitalistic system which is free, which is open. So far as the consumer is concerned, the consumer is protected by aggressive price competition, and the antitrust laws make it very clear that price-fixing is improper and illegal. As you know, in some cases violations of the antitrust laws can be criminal, and in those cases I think the criminal law should be vigorously enforced. A price-fixing agreement that is unlawful can cause great damage and great injury, just as much as a bank embezzler can, and I am in favor of strict enforcement of the criminal laws when there is a violation. 

I am not an economist and I would want to hear the arguments in the particular case before I ventured anything that I think would be of very much substance or help to you, Senator. I would want to look at the facts in the particular case.

Well, I would not want to do that because I really do not have a fixed position. I think my earlier answer indicates to you that I would be as sensitive to and most interested in those arguments that indicated that economic efficiency was not the sole controlling determinant.

I think that any person who argues for a simple conclusive formula always has the burden of proof to demonstrate to me that it is correct.

I just do not want to tell you that there has been a lot of thinking on my part when there has not been, Senator. To the extent that the precedents say that economic efficiency is not the sole determinant—and that is the way I understand most of the precedents in the area—the burden of proof would be on theperson who wishes to change that doctrine and change that approach.

That is an eminently persuasive statement of the antitrust laws, which commends itself to me, Senator.

Thank you, Senator. 

We have confronted that on our own court, Senator, and it is a difficult problem. But I think, as you have indicated, that it is also a very important one. In some cases on the court in the ninth circuit you can not always tell really how long an author of an opinion has had a case because sometimes when a panel is in disagreement, one of us will say, well, why don't you let me try writing the opinion and I will see if I can solidify our view.And the two polar tensions here are, on the one hand, the duty of the judge to speak his or her conscience and not to compromise his or her views. Judicial decisions are not a log-rolling or a trading exercise. That is inappropriate. And, on the other hand, there is the institutional need to provide guidance, to provide uniformity, to have a statement of rules that all of the court agrees on. And I think that the Supreme Court functions much better if it has fewer fragmented opinions. Fragmented opinions are terribly difficult for all of us to work with.I recognize that these are the toughest issues there are, and so views will differ. On the other hand, I think it is the duty of the judge to submerge his or her own ego, to accept the fact that his or her colleagues, too, have much wisdom and have great dedication to the law. Sometimes I have concurred in opinions simply because I did not think the majority had it right, but I can not say that those have added a great deal to the volume of the law. I think there is much in what you suggest, to commend judges to try to concur in other judges' opinions.

Holmes and Brandeis were also known for their freat dissents. You must stand alone. You may be vox clamatis in deserto, a voice crying in the wilderness, even though it is a lonely and difficult position. Judging is a lonely and difficult position. This is a very lonely job, Senator.The Federal system has its own isolation that it imposes on the judges. Within your own chambers, within your own thought processes, you wrestle to come to the right result. If you think there is a matter of legal principle that has been ignored, if you think there is a matter of principle that affects constitutional rule, if you think there is a principle that affects the judgment in the case, you must state that principle, regardless of how embarrassing or awkward it may be.

Well, I think, Senator, that Justices simply must be conscious of the duties that they have to the public, the duties they have to the lower courts, the duties they have to the bar—to give opinions that are clear, workable, pragmatic, understandable, and well-founded in the Constitution. More than that I cannot say, other than that judges also must be careful about distinguishing between a matter of principle and a matter that really is dear to their own ego.

I agree that that is a very valuable characteristic in a Justice.

Yes, and I am glad that you brought the subject up. I think there is a progression, in at least three stages. There is original intent in the sense of what they actually thought. 

There is original intent in the sense of what they might have thought if they had thought about the problem. I do not think either of those are helpful. There is the final term of original intent in the sense of what were the legal consequences of their acts, and you call that the original meaning. 

I accept that as a good description. We often say intent because we think of legislative intent, and in this respect, we mean legislative meaning as well.Your actions have an institutional meaning. One of you may vote for a statute for one reason, and another for another reason, but the courts find an institutional meaning there and give it effect.

Yes. We always have to keep in mind the object for which we are making the inquiry, and the object for which we are making inquiry is to determine the objective, the institutional intent, or the original meaning, as you say, of the document. That is our ultimate objective.

It is the public acts of the framers—what they said, the legal consequences of what they did, as you point out and suggest by your phrase, not their subjective motivations.

Yes. 

Yes, sir. 

I think that is correct. Yes, sir. 

I think that is a fair beginning. 

In that case, I thought an adequate showing had been made to survive a summary judgment motion. I said that to conclude, "That plaintiffs evidence could not justify striking down the at-large election system, does not, in my view, necessarily mean that the plaintiffs may not be entitled to some relief. For example, plaintiffs statistics regarding placement of polling places in private homes"—this is a very long paragraph. 

Yes, it would be a judge in this case, and I thought that the action did justify further pursuit in the courts. I have indicated that I thought that a complaint would lie for these actions. I did think, Senator, that because of the insistence of the plaintiffs that they wanted only the at-large election remedy, that a judge could not reasonably conclude that the at-large remedy—or pardon me—that the maintenance of the at-large system was intentionally caused, because I did not think that the evidence supported that inference.I did not think that inference could be drawn. Now, if you want to hypothesize, saying that because of this injury there should have been a remedy of district elections, then that is another point, and under the 1982 amendments to the Voting Act, I think that may very well be the case.

Well, I was a single judge. I did not have the dispositive power over the judgment.

Invidious is the term that the ABA used, and it is the term that the Judicial Ethics Committee uses as well.It is not a term that so far as I know has a meaning that has been explored in the case law, and therefore, it is somewhat imprecise. I think that the dictionary definition would be evil or hostile.

The law in torts says that you can be charged with the natural consequences of your own acts. It is clear, to me, that if a discriminatory barrier exists for too long, if it is visible, if it is hurtful, and if it is condoned, that the person who condones it can be charged with invidious discrimination. I would concede that.

TO begin with, you have to remember that the class action failed there. So the question is whether a person who has an individual injury can sue.

And the Supreme Court decision does make it easier for those persons who are injured to file an individual suit after the class has failed. 

Our concern was that by the pendency of the class action, of course, the defendant has an open-ended contingent liability, and there is some interest in terminating those contingencies and in encouraging people with individual claims to come forward so the defendant knows what it has to defend against. 

And in this case, the plaintiff did not seek to intervene even after the court gave leave to intervene. The court gave leave to intervene at the conclusion of the class action, and the plaintiff did not. That was our rationale for saying that the statute has run. I certainly do think it is a close case, and I am quite willing to accept the decision of the Supreme Court. I forget197 where the other circuits were on that point. I think we followed the decision of the second circuit, but I am not sure.

Yes. 

They do not. If you will look at our opinion in Lynn v. Western Gillette, I am tempted to say, you will see that I was quite capable of giving a generous interpretation to a statute of limitation in a Civil Rights Act case. The claims cases you mentioned against the Government are ones where I wish the Congress would pass just a little bill 

Well, thank you, Senator. I think it is an important part of the advise and consent process that you make the judge aware of your own deep feelings and sensitivities. I would say that if I am appointed to the Supreme Court and I do not fully meet the great proclamation that stands over its podium, that I would consider that my career has not been a success.

White collar crime, as I have indicated in the initial exchange with Senator Metzenbaum, is, I think, an unfortunate term. It sounds as if it is a clean crime, which is, of course, a contradiction in terms. White collar crime can rob people of millions of dollars just as effectively as a person with a gun. I know bank officers who have congratulated me for my tough stance on crime because we put away bank robbers, but then they will turn around and they will, for fear of publicity, not prosecute one of their officers who has embezzled $50,000. I think that is wrong. White collar crime is very, very dangerous, particularly in the consumer fraud area where people are deprived of their life savings. I think the courts should be very vigorous with respect to socalled white collar crime, and I wish we could find another aphorism that indicates that it is really a very, very ugly deed that we are talking about. 

Federalism is one of the four structural components of the Constitution. The framers thought of it as really one of the most essential safeguards of liberty. They thought that it was improper, that it was spiritually wrong, morally wrong, for a people to delegate so much power to a remote government that they could no longer have control over their own destiny, their own lives. That is the reason for the states.The framers were very concerned that the sheer problem of geographic size would doom their experiment in a republican form of government. Their studies had taught them that the only successful republican form of government or democracy would be a small city-State. In those times, there were great diversities. One of the framers at the convention from South Carolina said the differences that divided his State and Maine and New Hampshire and Massachusetts were greater than those that divided Russia and Turkey. And he might have been right.

That is the purpose of the Federal system, and it is the duty of all the branches of the government to respect the position of the place of the states in the Federal system. As I indicated yesterday, there are no automatic mechanisms, or very few, in the Constitution, to respect the rights of States. You can read all through the Constitution and you will see very little about States. This indicates, I think, that we have a special obligation to ascertain the effects of national policy on the existence of State sovereignty. 

Yes, sir. 

I've sometimes tried to make up all-star lists of the Supreme Court. I will usually just put on seven in case somebody else has their favorites. Chief Justice Marshall foresaw the great destiny of this country. He knew the necessity for a national government. He had a power and a persuasiveness and a rhetoric and a morality to his opinions that few other justices have ever possessed. He went to law school for just 6 weeks. He had a remarkable grasp of the meaning of government and the meaning of the Constitution. The two Justice Harlans, the Justice Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson, and the Justice Harlan of the not too distant past, were great, great judges because of their understanding of the Constitution. Brandeis, Cardozo and Holmes sat on the same Court, and were some of the greatest justices who ever sat on the Court. And one of your colleagues, one of your predecessor colleagues, Hugo Black, was one of the great justices of the Court. He had a hideaway office somewhere here in the Capitol, and he would read Burke and Marx and Hume and Keynes and Plato and Aristotle during the Senate's sessions. He was simply a magnificent justice. He carried around, as many of you know, a little pocket copy of the Constitution at all times, in case he was asked about it, a habit that has been emulated by many of his admirers. Those were all great men in the history of the court, Senator. To talk only of those who are not living. 

Mr. Justice Van Devanter. He was one of the greatest justices on the court for achieving a compromise among the justices.When they were searching for a common point of agreement, Mr. Justice Van Devanter could find it.He did not produce a lot of the opinions of the Court, because he found it very difficult to write; he was a slow writer.But he was valued very, very highly by all of his colleagues. 

Thank you, Senator. 

I am not aware of that. He was from Clay County in Alabama. 

I think that is correct, Senator. 

Well, I suppose I had the fourth amendment in mind generally. This is pretty broad rhetoric.With the fourth amendment, we have, as I have indicated, extracted a tremendous cost for putting the system in place.Now that it is in place, it works rather well if it has a pragmatic cast to it. That is the purpose of the good faith exception. Whether the good faith exception is going to be so broad that it will swallow up the rule remains to be seen.

NOW that it is in place, I think we have had experience with it, and I think it is a workable part of the criminal system.

If it is administered in a pragmatic and reasonable way. 

I am not sure I understood your question, Senator. 

Yes. 

Well, I did not mean to imply that. I think that the courts were generally concerned that there was a lack of any enforcement of that provision.

The purposes are in the nature of a deterrent. The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to advise law enforcement officers in advance that if they do not follow the rules of the fourth amendment, the evidence they seize is not going to be usable. Now if the rule goes beyond that point, and a police officer in all good faith, after studying the rule, makes a snap decision that a warrant is valid, or a considered decision that a warrant is valid, then I think the system ought to give some recognition to that reasonable exercise of judgment on his part.

That could very well happen. And it remains to stake out the proper dimensions of that rule—of that exception.

The courts must act there, because it is their rule.

NO. Although there may be cases where the right—no, I think not.

Well, no, and of course that is ^re-Gideon. 

NO. 

Well, as a general proposition of law, it is accepted. I know of no really substantial advocacy for its change. 

Well, we are going down the line here. The Miranda rule, it seems to me, again, we have paid the major cost by installing it. We have now educated law enforcement officers and prosecutors all over the country, and it has become almost part of the criminal justice folklore. 

Criminal justice system folklore. Well, I think that since it is established, it is entitled to great respect. 

That is a remarkable example of the power of the courts. And it is a reason for judges reminding themselves that they should confine their rules to the absolute necessities of the case. 

Well, the Miranda rule, as I said, is in place. It was a sweeping, sweeping rule. It wrought almost a revolution. It is not clear to me that it necessarily followed from the words of the Constitution. Yet it is in place now, and I think it is entitled to great respect. 

That is right. I think it went to the verge of thelaw.

Yes.

Well, the merit of simple rules is that they areworkable. Their vice is that they may go beyond the necessities ofthe case.

I think they may have, yes.

Well, we have had situations like that where wehave had single judges acting in single motions.

Yes, sir. The first thing you do is you take offyour coat, and you sit down at the desk and you begin working itout. If there is merit to the claim you simply have to stop the exe-cution until you get the information before you. You may end upincreasing the suffering, and the aggravation, and the anguish ofthe defendant, but I just know of no other way to do it.It happens with every single execution. The courts do not lookgood. We act with the appearance of feverish haste. The defendant,who has been sentenced to die, has his deadline extended again.But the law of this country is that the Supreme Court of theUnited States exercises supervisory power over its circuits, and if that is what the jurisdiction is, the jurisdiction must be exercised.

There are no mechanical rules. Now there have been suggestions by task forces that we have fixed points for cutting off any petitions, but the problem was always that there is new evidence and new argument, and I just do not know how to cut that off.

Well, they have not even come out with anything, that I have looked at, that looks very solid.

Yes. 

Thank you, sir. 

Well, I am not—of course order and liberty can be set up on a polar spectrum, but I think it was Mr. Justice Reed who said that, "To say that our choice is between order and liberty is an act of desperation." You may have order and liberty, and without both you only have anarchy. That is my addition. 

Pardon me? 

The tension does seem to be unavoidable. 

Well, I am uncomfortable with saying that the judicial branch has assumed a role that was not intended for it by the Constitution. On the other hand, we have to recognize that immediately after the Hamiltonian structure and the Madisonian—it was really a Hamiltonian structure that was in place—we had a Jeffersonian Bill of Rights added onto it. And so, from the outset, we built in a tension, and the framers did not pay very much attention to the courts, Senator, and I am not quite sure why that is. Perhaps it is because they never conceived of the courts exercising the broad jurisdiction, the broad authority to announce the law that they now have. I am just not sure why. It is fascinating. They distrusted the legislature. You have bicameralism as a principal check, and, of course, the President, and there are very few checks on the courts. And so that is why it is important for the court to check itself. 

I do. Yes, sir. 

I think when a judge defines, or articulates a constitutional principle, he should find very, very convincing and authoritative evidence to support his, or her, conclusion. 

I could not accept that formulation as being consistent with the Court's role in the constitutional system. 

I would agree; I had an exchange with Senator Humphrey just before the luncheon break in which we were discussing the categories that a judge might look to in order to determine whether there was a privacy claim, and it occurred to me, as soon as I concluded my answer, that I had made an assumption but had not stated it. And the assumption is we are doing this in order to determine if this fits with the text and the purpose of the Constitution. That is why we are doing it. We are not doing it because of our own subjective beliefs. We are not doing it because of our own ideas of justice. We are doing it because we think that there is a thread, a link to what the framers provided in the original document. 

AS you have stated it, that, it seems to me, would be an illicit theory. 

Well, that is the existing law, and we had a colloquy earlier this morning in which I indicated that this is a rather210 untidy area of the Constitution, so far as explaining the justification and the constitutional bases for administrative agencies.I think most of us recognize their necessity, and there is no question that agencies make law. We cannot avoid that fact. And so I think I would say that I do agree that that is what happens.

Yes, and I could say the same things about decisions of courts. I agree.

I thought that this was a tremendously difficult problem in the Chadha case. In the Chadha case, there was an adjudication of an alien's status, and he was granted leave to remain in the United States on the grounds of extreme hardship.They made an adjudication in an individual case. One House of the Congress, the House of Representatives, for no given reason, attempted to cancel that and he was to be deported.We found, in the ninth circuit, that this was impermissible, that this was an interference with the core function of the executive branch, and also with the judicial branch.The opinion was written very narrowly because we reserved the question of whether or not the Congress might have a veto mechanism over the rulemaking functions of agencies. We did not think that case was presented and we thought that that might present different considerations.Now we recognized, of course, that any broader formulation than the one we adopted would strike down 250 statutes, and we thought that one was enough for that opinion.The Supreme Court did affirm our court, but I have to say, on a different rationale. The Chief Justice, writing for the court, invoked the presentment clause and thereby I think pretermitted any evaluation of a one-House veto over rulemaking, and we did not come to that conclusion.But that is the law, and the Supreme Court has handed down the Chadha case, and I think that legislative veto in one House, or both House vetoes—

Yes. I tried to find that. You know, it can work both ways for us, Senator. We do not always find the answer we want. I read all of "The Federalist Papers." I read everything I could find that Madison had written.I read what Jefferson had written, even though he was not at the Convention. I concluded that, in this case, the veto mechanism did violate the express intent of the framers.And it is a good example of the fact that the Constitution can teach you something.

Well, you are asking me for my legal opinion. In the case that we wrote, we found sufficient differentiation between an adjudicatory proceeding, on one hand, and generic rulemaking, which is what you are describing on the other, to confine our case to the former. I thought that the situation you described, with generic rulemaking, might present a different constitutional problem.

I think it is a good example of it, Senator, and it is one in which I thought the Constitution spoke rather clearly against interference with the core function of another branch of the government.I thought that the legislative veto in Chadha was violative of the provision of separation of powers, and I made it clear that the legislative veto, in other instances, might not violate that separation.What you had in Chadha was one of the highest officers in the executive branch of the government, making a determination in his executive capacity It was followed by court review or the possibility of court review, and, for one House of Congress, without reason, to simply upset that adjudication, seemed to me to violate separation of powers, and we so held.

Well, the non-delegation cases—and I think that is the right term to give them—seem to be lying dormant, don't they? And it is not clear, to me, the extent to which they still have vitality.But these questions go very much to the core of the functioning of the Congress, and I think that the Congress must give very, very90-878 0 - 3 9 - 8careful attention to how it can control the agencies that it creates. I think that problem is pointed up by the opinion of the Supreme Court, and of our own court, in Chadha.

Well, it might be somewhat presumptuous of me to characterize the legal education establishment nationwide in just a few words, particularly because I am a part-time law professor.It is true that the law schools throughout the United States have a tremendous influence on the way our system works. There is a high degree of uniformity in law school teaching and in law school curriculum, and this has some great benefits. To begin with, lawyers are taught, in effect, a national language and this makes for a very, very efficient legal system.The capitalistic system in this country, and the corporation system, was built by the legal profession. They are important as shipwrights were to England. And so the legal profession has, and the legal education system has presented a tremendous contribution to the capitalistic system of this country with the legal talent that it educates.Now, on the other hand, with this uniformity we can create perhaps a lack of diversity, a lack of creativity. I don't see that in the law schools. I think individual professors are willing and able to explore their own philosophies in their own terms. But the danger is always there and I think law schools should be aware of it—the danger of uniformity.

I am not particularly comfortable in making those judgments. I am certain that a number of law school professors do hold that view, but there are others who do not.

Well, as I indicated yesterday, I, within certain limits of tolerance, do not care what ray students think. I do care passionately how they think. The method is the important thing. Each case must be justified according to logic, according to precedent, and according to the law of the Constitution, and I insist that each student do that for every case.

Yes. That is a routine part of the curriculum. It is a routine part of the exercise. Because if those decisions cannot stand rigor->us analysis, then they can be called in question. Senator G K A ^ ,U: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Well, thank you, Senator. I didn't take it in any other respect. 

I would be pleased to do that, sir. [The questions for Senator DeConcini appear at p. 733.] 

That, of course, is the law and I know of no strong argument for overruling the law that is now in place.

Well, I don't want to commit myself that I wouldn't re-examine it, but I think it would take a strong argument to require me to change it. 

Yes, sir. 

Judge Claiborne was a U.S. District Judge in the District of Nevada. He was indicted and tried for various charges, one of which was the solicitation of a bribe from a former client of his. The former client of his was one Conforte who operated a brothel in Nevada known as The Mustang Ranch. Claiborne had been Conforte's attorney when Conforte was charged by the U.S. Government for tax evasion. Conforte was convicted. Claiborne was not his attorney on the appeal because between the time of the ending of the trial and the taking of the appeal Claiborne became a judge. Conforte's case was appealed to the ninth circuit. There was a three-judge panel consisting of Judge Tang, a United States Circuit Judge from Arizona; Judge Palmieri, U.S. District Judge from the Southern District of New York, sitting with us by designation; and me, and I was the presiding member of the panel. During the oral argument of the case, the.panel was quite vigorous in questioning the government, and it might have appeared to someone who was in the audience that the panel was quite concerned about the conviction and might be disposed to overturning Conforte's conviction. The ninth circuit, because of its workload, historically has assigned district judges to sit with us on the circuit, and Claiborne himself, now a judge, had been assigned to our circuit and had sat with me a week earlier, and he subsequently sat with me a month later. At the time he sat with me earlier, a week or so before, I was not aware that the Conforte case would come up and I had no idea that he was connected with it. When I sat with him a month later I suppose I was aware of it, but we certainly did not discuss it. The allegation was that Claiborne solicited a bribe from his client of $50,000—I never did read the indictment—of a certain amount of money in order to influence the panel in its decision. Each of the judges on the panel, including me, testified to the factthat Claiborne had not contacted us to influence the result of the case.I did not hear the testimony. I was careful not to hear the testimony or read the newspaper accounts or even read the indictment. So my information on the case may not be even as good as someone who read the newspapers. But, as I understand it, the testimony was that Claiborne, the judge, had told Conforte, his former client, that Claiborne had met with Judge Palmieri in Judge Palmieri's apartment in New York. Judge Palmieri had never met the man, and so testified. All of us testified that there had been no attempts to influence us in the case.I did say that Judge Claiborne, in a telephone conversation, with my clerk a party to the conversation, had asked when are you coming out with the Conforte case and I had said the case is under submission, which was a polite way of saying I am not talking about the case.My testimony and the testimony of the other judges before the U.S. district court, which was now trying Claiborne for the bribery charge and for the tax evasion charges, was to outline the circumstances, to explain how the court of appeals works, to give background, and to give in a capsule—and to say what I have just told you in a capsule form.The jury did not convict on any of the counts. It was a hung jury. Subsequently, Judge Claiborne was retried just for some tax evasion counts. They did not retry on this matter. And he was convicted in court and subsequently was impeached by the House of Representatives and convicted and removed by the U.S. Senate.

Yes. 

Yes, I testified as a government witness in the case. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes, sir. 

Yes, Senator. The bill, incidentally, in the form that it was initially proposed, the Nunn-DeConcini bill, and the form that we were concerned with in the Arizona debate was much more far-reaching than the bill that eventually was adopted. And that bill would have permitted a national committee of judges to inquire into the fitness and the behavior of any sitting U.S. judge, and I took, as did a number of my colleagues, the position that this was a serious threat to the independence of the judiciary.The judges of the United States must be in a position where they can agree with each other and also disagree with each other very vigorously. And, if you are in a collegial body, and as you well know in the Senate, and you must constantly disagree and debate your colleagues, you need to rely on every bit of decorum, every bit of tradition, every bit of courtesy, every bit of etiquette that you can summon in order to maintain your professional friendship with each other. And we felt that this was one of the serious defects of Nunn-DeConcini. That it would set judge against judge in an arena where previously the Constitution had committed that responsibility solely to the U.S. Senate, and those were some of the grounds of our opposition to the bill.

Well, I suppose it does, although there, in the context where we were called as witnesses for the government, it was not as if we, the judges, were bringing the case.

The framers were very deliberate about this decision, as you well know, Senator, and what have there been? Something like, I am tempted to say nine impeachments before Claiborne. There have been ten impeachments and five convictions, or something like that, in the history of the United States. There have been about 10 or 12 other instances where the Senate was about to convict and the judge resigned.I adhere to my view that the existing constitutional system should be maintained. I am a little cautious about commenting at length on your impeachment procedures for two reasons: one, because I haven't given the matter much thought; two, because thereis a case in the courts now involving a judge and it is likely to come before the Supreme Court.I think we can say that most of the commentary in the literature has been that the design of the impeachment trial process and its conduct is for the Senate to decide, guided by the managers in the House, and that it is not judicially reviewable.

AS you know, Senator, there are two methods of recusal. One is automatic recusal. Automatic recusal is required under the statute whenever a judge has a financial interest, even the ownership of one share of stock in a corporation that is a party to a given case.So the first thing you do is you look at the statute—it is 18 USC Section 455—to determine whether or not recusal is required.Then there is a more flexible standard in which the judge in his discretion must recuse himself if his impartiality can reasonably be perceived as being affected in the case.In the instance you give, I do not think the fact that I gave one speech, even though it was a rather hard-hitting speech as I recall, would disqualify me, because I think I could keep a fair and open mind on the issue.

I realize that some Supreme Court nominees have taken the position before this committee that the reason they cannot answer the questions is they have to recuse.I have some trouble with that. I think the reason for our not answering detailed questions with respect to our views on specific cases, or specific constitutional issues, is something quite different.I think the reason is that the public expects that the judge will keep an open mind, and that he is confirmed by the Senate because of his temperament and his character, and not because he has taken particular positions on the issues.The press is designed to keep politics and the judicial function separate. It is not because we would be compelled to recuse ourselves in cases.

Yes. I cannot say at this time that I have given any specific consideration to the new provisions which involve restitution and so forth.I misspoke. I sat on one case on whether or not restitution could be required as a condition of parole.And I can't now recall if I authored the opinion or not. But we held that the judge was within his discretion in insisting that as a condition of parole, the offender make restitution to the victim. That is an important part of the criminal process. The whole point of awareness about the victims—is because we can expand our horizon somewhat.Sometimes the best way to impress upon the criminal defendant, especially if he is a first time offender in a domestic violence type of case, the best way to impress on him, on the defendant, the moral wrong that he has committed, the best way to encourage him to ask for the forgiveness of the victim, is to confront him or her with the victim in the proceeding.And that has worked in lower courts. In the State courts, they are doing this more than we are in the federal courts.

I think it was in the New Zealand speech, in which I indicated that the Goetz case had been a celebrated case, and simply speculated on whether or not this particular person felt abused by the system, not in anyway intending to excuse the act, but just attempting to point out that victims are a real party in interest in the crime.They have a certain standing in the proceeding. In many cases, the ordeal the victim faces requires him or her to relive the circumstances of the crime.It is very, very difficult. And courts can do so much just by the way of attitude, simple mechanical arrangements for the convenience and the comfort of the victim, to make it known that the law has an interest in the victim.

My initial reaction is that I think it might make me and my colleagues behave differently than we would otherwise.Perhaps we would become accustomed to it after awhile. The press is a part of our environment. We cannot really excise it from the environment.But in the courtroom, I think that the tradition has been that we not have that outside distraction, and I am inclined to say that I would not want them in appellate court chambers.I once had a case—it was a very celebrated case—in the City of Seattle. The courtroom was packed. We were at a critical point in the argument. I was presiding.A person came in with all kinds of equipment and began setting it up. He disturbed me. He disturbed the attorneys. He disturbed everybody in the room.He was setting up an easel to paint our picture, which was permitted. If he had a little Minox camera, we would have held him in contempt.So the standard doesn't always work. 

Well, my father once announced that we probably were. And my mother came back the next evening and said, you know, we are related. And she began to smile, and she said, on the Fitzgerald side. So [Laugher.] So I'm not sure. 

Well, there are two different questions at least, implicit in your statement. One is this question of legal realism altogether. And the second is the decisions of the Warren Court. I have indicated that I thought the decisions of the Warren Court went to the very verge of the law at least. We are talking about criminal procedure cases, the ones we have mentioned. That we have paid a heavy cost for imposing those rules on the criminal system; that they seem to be part of our constitutional system now; and that I think a very strong argument would have to be mounted in order to withdraw those decisions. I do think the decisions have evinced on an explicit basis, the fact that they involve pragmatic, preventative rules announced by the Court, and the Court itself has admitted that they are not necessarily demanded by the Constitution. Now, so far as legal realism is concerned, that is a philosophy which I think has a substantial grip on much of the profession, on much of the bench. And it is probably a description of how we feel and how we behave. But I think it has very little part in constitutional interpretation. Legal realism is really an offspring of the school of historicism, which is the idea that no principle, no institution, no charter, no rule, survives its own generation, its own time; that everything is up for grabs every generation. I think that is just completely inconsistent with the idea of a Constitution. I think it just has no place in constitutional law. Now, it is true that in the lower courts this may be a description of our process. Because we look at economics, and we look at sociology, et cetera, in order to make our judgments. But in those areas, the Senate of the United States and the Congress can correct us if we are wrong. 

Well, I have been rather cautious about going through a list of cases that I agree with and disagree with. BecauseI think that the position of a Supreme Court Justice has to be that precedents can be reexamined and we cannot commit to the Senate Judiciary Committee otherwise.

I think the answer is no. That statement is rapidly rising to the top of the list of things I wish 1 hadn't put in my speech notes.It was designed to trigger a discussion with the Stanford law faculty, which I am not sure we ever got to, about whether or not the Congress of the United States is in a position, under the Constitution, to make essential and important changes in its operations so that it can police and supervise the regulatory agencies that we said it could not in Chadha.Certainly I did not in the speech or in the speech notes mean to indicate any disrespect for the Congress or the legislative process. It is really the heart of our democracy.And I have said here repeatedly that in my view, it is the Con gress of the United States that must take the lead in ensuring the fact and the reality that we have the basic conditions necessary for the enjoyment of the Constitution.

Yes. 

That is my conviction. And I think that the Court has an important role to play in umpiring disputes between the political branches. 

I was thinking in two different areas. One in this area of separation of powers and the growth of the office of the presidency. The courts just have had nothing to do with that.Second, and even more importantly, is the shape of federalism. It seems to me that the independence of the States, or their non-independence, as the case may be, is really largely now committed to the Congress of the United States, in the enactment of its grantsin-aid programs, and in the determination whether or not to impose conditions that the States must comply with in order to receive federal monies; that kind of thing.

Well, I am not sure—I am not sure I read that entire speech. But if we can just take it as a question, whether or not I agree that the decisions of the Supreme Court are or are not the law of the land. They are the law of the land, and they must be obeyed. I am somewhat reluctant to say that in all circumstances each legislator is immediately bound by the full consequences of a Supreme Court decree. 

Well, as I have indicated before, the Constitution doesn't work very well if there is not a high degree of voluntary compliance, and, in the school desegregation cases, I think, it was not permissible for any school board to refuse to implement Brown v. Board of Education immediately. On the other hand, without specifying what the situations are, I can think of instances, or I can accept the proposition that a chief executive or a Congress might not accept as doctrine the law of the Supreme Court. 

Well, suppose that the Supreme Court of the United States tomorrow morning in a sudden, unexpected development were to overrule in New York Times v. Sullivan. Newspapers no longer have protection under the libel laws. Could you, as a legislator, say I think that decision is constitutionally wrong and Iwant to have legislation to change it? I think you could. And I think you should.

And I think you could make that judgment as a constitutional matter. 

But I think you could stand up on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say I am introducing this legislation because in my view the Supreme Court of the United States is 180 degrees wrong under the Constitution. And I think you would be fulfilling your duty if you said that. 

Well, I am just indicating that it doesn't seem to me that just because the Supreme Court has said it legislators cannot attempt to affect its decision in legitimate ways. 

Well, as I have indicated earlier in my testimony, I think it was a landmark in constitutional responsibility for the Presidents in the Youngstown case and the Nixon case to instantly comply with the Courts decisions. I think that was an exercise of the constitutional obligation on their part. I have no problem with that at all. 

Yes, but there just may be instances in which I think it is consistent with constitutional morality to challenge those views. And I am not saying to avoid those views or to refuse to obey a mandate. 

I would agree with that as a general proposition. I am not sure there are not exceptions. 

Not at the moment. 

I will let you know, Senator. 

Well, whether or not they are justiciable issues, of course, depends on the peculiar facts of the case, and I would not like to commit myself on that. But the very examples you gave indicate to me that there are within the political powers of the Congress, within its great arsenal of powers under article I of the Constitution, very strong remedies that it can take to bring a chief executive into compliance with its will, and this is the way the political system was designed to work. The framers knew about fighting for turf. I don't think they knew that term, but they deliberately set up a system wherein each branch would compete somewhat with the other in an orderly constitutional fashion for control over key policy areas. And these are the kinds of things where the political branches of the government may have a judgment that is much better than that of the courts. 

Well, I don't know if it is an abdication of responsibility for a nominee not to say that under all circumstances he thinks the Court can decide that broad of an issue. If the issue is presented in a manageable judicial form, in a manageable form,I have no objection to the Court being the umpire between the branches.On the other hand, I point out that having to rely on the courts may infer, or may imply an institutional weakness on the part of the Congress that is ultimately debilitating. It seems to me that in some instances Congress is better off standing on its own feet and making its position known, and then its strength in the federal system will be greater than if it had relied on the assistance of the courts.

Yes. 

I think so. Dean Choper, of the University of California at Berkeley, has a book in which he proposes the idea that the Court should always withdraw from any dispute between the branches. He would, I think, say Youngstown is wrong, that the Nixon tapes case is wrong, and I disagree with that. I think there is a role for the Court. 

Yes. And, as I think we would both agree, much of what I was saying there was a recitation of simple facts. The Presidency has grown to have power of tremendous proportions. 

This case had a long history. It went to the Supreme Court on more than one occasion. It was in our court on I guess four different occasions. And this particular aspect of it presented one of the most troubling areas of desegregation laws, and that is when does a court's supervision cease?In this case the City of Pasadena had, in compliance with a court decree, been implementing a plan that was certified ultimately by the Supreme Court to be a plan for a unitary district, which is the parlance for saying a district that complies in all respects with a desegregation decree.The findings of the Supreme Court of the United States and of our court—and uncontradicted by the district court—were that the district had met full compliance for a period of more than 2 years. Now the question was how long does the district court's supervision last? This was a case in which the district court judge at one time, in response to that question from an attorney, had said that district court supervision will last as long as I live.Now, at some point school districts must assume responsibilities for their own affairs. At some point the jurisdiction of the court must cease. At some point we must allow the school districts to again resume charge of their affairs. And, if there is a further violation of the Constitution of the United States, an action can then again be implemented.We concluded that because there had been full compliance, because a unitary district had been achieved, the court was acting improperly in looking at election campaign promises and election rhetoric in order to justify its continued decrees.What happened here was there were some schools—I forget if they called them magnet schools or neighborhood schools—that had been proposed in a district in which unitary compliance hadbeen achieved, and we simply ruled that the district had to again stand on its own feet, and that if there was a violation there could again be a suit.It is a very difficult area of the law to determine how to withdraw. The very fact that the court is involved affects the equation.

Well, it didn't amount to a declaration of bias and prejudice but it indicated the difficulties that the district court had in extricating itself from the decree of the court. And we felt that the school district having been in good faith full compliance for a period of years was entitled to a release of the jurisdiction of the court.

Well, we looked at the findings and concluded otherwise I think, Senator. I agree with you that the fact-finding functions of a district court cannot be usurped by an appellate body. On the other hand, they have to fit the ultimate remedy the court gave, and in this event we thought that the Pasadena School District should be restored to its own status.

Yes. 

I suppose I would disagree with your conclusion about very strong findings, in that I don't think the findings at all related to the remedy. I don't think the findings at all related to the violation that the district court findings were—the part you quoted was simply conclusory. The actual findings were that the State of Washington had done a comparable worth study. The actual findings were that the State of Washington had advertised in some cases for male-only jobs and that it had ceased that. And we simply found that as a matter of law this was wholly insufficient to say that Washington was violating the law by not adopting a comparable worth scheme for every one of its female employees.So I would think that those are fact findings simply are not related to the judge's conclusion, and so I would disagree with the characterization as strong.

YOU are certainly correct, Senator. 

Well, with reference to the death penalty, Senator, I have taken the position with your colleagues on the committee that the constitutionality of the death penalty has not come to my attention as an appellate judge and that I will not take a position on it, but that if it is found constitutional I think it should be efficiently enforced.229 

In a colloquy that we had earlier this afternoon, Senator 

Right. I mean one that I had before you came in. I made it clear that in my view it is quite appropriate for the Court to act as an umpire between the political branches of the government. The circumstances in which a case that meets the case or controversy doctrine are ones that we would have to examine in a particular case. I think that in the Youngstown case, the steel seizure case, and the Nixon tapes case, the Court acted completely appropriately in defining and determining the bounds of power between the two political branches. I think that is a completely appropriate role for the Court to play. 

I think Senator Leahy asked me that question. 

Well, I would be pleased to tell you, Senator, that I am committed to constitutional rule and I think every person in this Senate is, and I think every American is; and I want to do the best I can to honor that commitment. 

I have, Senator, and I believe the role of the Supreme Court must be to maintain its independence but at all times to obey the Constitution and the law. 

Absolutely. 

Not at all, Senator. I would not so view it. 

Senator, the Court can use history in order to make the meaning of the Constitution more clear. As the Court has the advantage of a perspective of 200 years, the Constitution becomes clearer to it, not more murky. The Court is in a superior advantage to the position held by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall when he was beginning to stake out the meanings of the Constitution in the great decisions that he wrote.And this doesn't mean the Constitution changes. It just means that we have a better perspective of it. This is no disparagement of the Constitution. It is no disparagement of the idea that the intentions and the purposes of the framers should prevail. To say that new generations yield new insights and new perspectives does not mean the Constitution changes. It just means that our understanding of it changes.The idea that the framers of the Constitution made a covenant with the future is what our people respect and that is why they follow the judgments of the Supreme Court, because they perceive that we are implementing the understanding of the framers. I am committed to that principle.

AS you know, Senator, stare decisis has an element of certainty to it, which most Latin phrases do, but it really is a description of the entire legal process. Stare decisis is the guarantee of impartiality. It is the basis upon which the case system proceeds, and without it we are simply going from day to day with no stability, with no contact with our past.And so stare decisis is very important, but, obviously, if a case is illogical, if it cannot be reconciled with all of the parallel precedent, if it appears that it is simply out of accord with the purposes of the Constitution, then it must be overruled.

Thank you for those gracious remarks, Mr. Chairman, and for the courtesy that all of your colleagues have shown me. The advise and consent process is a very meaningful one to me. 

Not at all, Senator. 

Well, it is not clear to me that a Senator can always reject a nominee because of some disagreement with philosophy. But, if you have a nominee who tells you that he or she is not bound by the law of the Constitution, that he or she is superior to precedent, that he or she has some superior insights into the great principles that made this country devoted to constitutional rule, then I think you could very easily reject that nominee. 

I think there may be a problem in that I am not sure that, in the last 20 years, any nominee has not embraced the doctrine of judicial restraint because that is a phrase that is rather simple to adopt, and the question is whether or not it is given meaning and given application in the deliberative approach that the judge brings to his or her work. I can point to my record—12 years of opinions in which I think I indicate that careful approach. 

They are unless they are used with the view to determining what the Constitution means. The framers had—by that I mean those who ratified the Constitution—a very importantidea when they used the word "person" and when they used the word "liberty." And these words have content in the history of Western thought and in the history of our law and in the history of the Constitution, and I think judges can give that content. They cannot simply follow their own subjective views as to what is fair or what is right or what is dignified. They can do that so that they can understand what the Constitution has always meant.

Yes. 

Well, to begin with, don't shoot the messenger. I am describing the jurisprudence of the Court as I think it exists. The Court has simply not had the occasion to reach the ninth amendment for the resolution of its cases, and it seems to me inappropriate for me to announce in advance what its meaning is. I have indicated what I think, what I understand its original purpose to be, which was actually a disclaimer that the Constitution of the United States was intended to constrain the States in any respect in the adoption of their Bills of Rights.

NO. 

Well, the purpose of it is as I believe I have described it. 

Its meaning is somewhat unclear. The reason for Madison's using it as a device is not completely clear. I think the explanation I gave is the best one, but that is not completely clear. 

I think that that is the most plausible interpretation of the amendment.

Well, I guess we have a disagreement as to whether or not it is well settled, Senator. These decisions are very close. Some Justices have indicated that it is unconstitutional, and I simply think that I should not take a specific position on a constitutional debate of ongoing dimension. I have indicated that in my view if held constitutional it should be swiftly and efficiently enforced. I recognize also that capital punishment is recognized in the Constitution, in the fifth amendment. 

Capital punishment is recognized in the Constitution. 

In the fifth amendment. 

Well, I was trying to indicate that simply because we find a new word we don't avoid a whole lot of very difficult problems. It is not clear to me that substituting the word "privacy" is much of an advance over interpreting the word "liberty," which is already in the Constitution. And I indicated that, to illustrate that, that the Convention on Human Rights, which contains the word "private," produced a case which had many of the same issues in it that we would have to confront, and so that the woru "privacy" should not be something that convinces us that we have much certainty in this area. 

That is why I have indicated that I think liberty does protect the value of privacy in some instances.

Yes. 

Yes, sir. 

Certainly not in a constitutional case. 

Emanations. 

Emanations, yes. "Penumbras and emanations" was the phrase used in the Griswold case. 

Not at all. And I have indicated it is not even in any previous—the Senator indicated it was not even in any previous cases. 

Yes, sir. 

I don't find the phrase very helpful. 

Thank you, Senator. I will certainly commit to the former, and I will try to comply with the latter. 

I think I glanced at it some years ago, Senator. 

All right. 

Both the incident and the class discussion are not very clear.

But I had the habit of talking to my students in the course of a 3y2-hour lecture about the problems that lawyers face in their practice, and I think it is imperative that lawyers realize that they have an obligation, first of all, to know themselves, to know their own motivations and to comply with the law strictly so that they can be a model for their clients.And I recited to my class, as I recall, the incident of a lady who had come to our office seeking employment, and at the time we did not have a position open in any event, but I was pleased to chat with her. She was extremely well qualified. She had sent in a resume I think and I had said that if she was in town we would be glad to talk to her. It wasn't clear to me from the resume that she was male or female.And when she was a female I told her that she might find some resistance in certain law firms and told her the story of a lawyer in San Francisco whom I know very well and who is a man of remarkable self-knowledge and remarkable honesty and who has a remarkable admiration for the law, who had taken the position that he would not have women in his law firm because he had a very close relation with his partners and he did not want to share that relation with another woman because of the respect he had for his wife. He behaved the way he did in front of his partners, in a way that he thought was very free, and he thought of his relations with the law partners as very intimate.And I told her that this was an attitude that many lawyers had about their law partners. I said that in my own law firm that she would find certain problems of adjustment because of the way my partners behaved, but that I wanted to put this out in front for her, to tell her that this was the kind of thinking that some people that were sitting on the other side of an interview desk would be having, and that if I were ever to either hire or not hire her and I harbored those feelings that I wanted to make her sure that she knew that I was trying to explore, for my own satisfaction, my own motives, and my own intent.And I told her that the world was changing. I told her also the story of when I was in the Harvard Law School and a certain professor would have "Ladies Day," and ladies were not called on unless it was "Ladies Day." And today this would not only be seen as terribly stigmatizing and patronizing but probably actionable.And I recited this to my students to indicate that lawyers must always be honest with themselves about their motivation, honest with the people with which they deal about their motivation. And the lady, as I recall, was very appreciative of the conversation. She subsequently went to work in her own city of Los Angeles, I believe, which was where she was from. And that was all that the incident was about.

Well, of course that wasn't my view. I was trying to indicate to her that I thought that the law was very much in flux and that it would change, and it has. Women now occupy

I think it is good that it has changed. 

Women can bring marvelous insight to the legal profession. Women, themselves, have been in a position where they have been subjected to both overt and subtle barriers to their advancement, and the fact that women are on the bench and on our court brings a very, very valuable insight and perspective. We now have, I would think, close to 35 or 40 percent women in the night division of our law school class, and they are making their way into the profession and are performing admirably. And it is too bad they were not in it a hundred years ago. 

Absolutely. I have had female law clerks that I have worked extremely closely with and it has been a really very remarkable years when they have been with me. I have enjoyed it very much. 

I think my second set of clerks had my first female—I guess my third set of clerks, my third year. 

1978. 

Well, in general terms, it is not clear to me that Chief Justice Burger's position would be any different if the ninthamendment were not in the Constitution. I think liberty can support those conclusions he reached, and the meaning, purpose, and interpretation of the ninth amendment, 1 think the Court has very deliberately not found it necessary to explore.

I think I used the words "reserve clause." 

And I think the Court as a whole—I am not talking about individual Justices—has taken that view of the amendment, that they just find it unnecessary to reach that point. 

And it is the ultimate irony that an amendment that was designed to assuage the States is being used by a federal entity to tell the States that they cannot commit certain acts. 

I understand that position. 

Pardon me. Which case, Senator? 

Aranda v. Van Sickle, yes, sir. 

Weil, Senator, I have some obligation to be interesting and creative, and I am disturbed by the fact that I may sound very repetitive because I have been through this with the other Senators this morning and again earlier this afternoon.The parties and the attorneys have the right to determine the shape and the contours of their lawsuit. The repeated questioning in the court indicated to me that the attorneys were there for one remedy, and one remedy only, and that was the invalidation of atlarge elections and the substitution of district elections.

The law that we were applying at the time was that the remedy had to fit the violation, and the insistence was that this was the only remedy they wanted. And I was sufficiently concerned about it that I wrote the separate opinion indicating with every hint I could that I was very concerned about some substantive violations, but that I had to agree with my colleagues that the remedy was not permitted.

Certainly. 

Yes, I think another remedy could have been ordered. So I think all we are talking about is whether or not I as a single judge should have said that I would remand. I certainly didnot have that authority because I did not have the votes. I did not have the authority to write the mandate in this case.

I cannot recall. 

That may have been, but they committed themselves to something that in legal consequence was entirely different, and they simply have to bear the consequences of that decision.They made an agreement among themselves that racial discrimination would not be permitted when it was at the behest of the State, and I think they are bound by the consequences of what they did, regardless of whether .

Well, I guess, again, it comes down to a difference of the use of the term "intent."

NO. In fact, once again, the framers could have drafted the amendment so that it applied to blacks only, but they did not. They used the word "person."

I am not sure that the clear and present danger test is a full description of the full protection that the Court gives to freedom of speech. I think Brandenburg goes a little further than the clear and present danger test.

Yes. 

I know of no substantial, responsible argument which would require the overruling of that precedent. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Well, no apologies are necessary, Senator. 

NO apologies are necessary, and I appreciate, Mr. Chairman and Senator, the great consideration and courtesy that you have shown to me and my family. We have enjoyed it. 

I will abide by the will of the Senate, Senator. 

Thank you very much, Senator. 

Thank you very much, Senator. 

Thank you very much.
