It is correct, I believe, Mr. Chairman. 

Yes, I did have at the time while I was practicing. 

AS I recall, the minimum period in which you could get an A.V. rating at the time was a period of practice of 10 years. And it seems to me I got it in 1966, though I cannot be absolutely positive as to the date. It was very shortly after the expiration of the minimum period. 

Yes, I believe it is. 

That certainly—it was either 11 or 12 years, Mr. Chairman. I am not positive as to the exact date. 

That is my understanding. 

I would not, Senator McClellan. 

I do not believe I would, Senator. I think that 

NO; I would not. 

I would not overrule a prior decision on the grounds that you suggest. 

I feel that great weight should be given to precedent. I think the Supreme Court has said many times that it is perhaps entitled to perhaps somewhat less weight in the field of constitutional law than it is in other areas of the law. But, nonetheless, I believe great weight should be given to it. I think that the fact that the Court was unanimous in handing down a precedent makes a precedent stronger than if a court was 5 to 4 in handing down the precedent. And I think the fact that a precedent has stood for a very long time, or has been reexamined by a succeeding number of judges, gives it added weight. 

None. 

NO; I do not believe I would. 

I not only can conceive it to be true, Senator McClellan, but I can recall at least one instance in which Justice Jackson, to whom I clerked, found as a Supreme Court Justice that he was obliged to disagree with something he had done as Attorney General. And I believe the same thing happened to Justice Clark.

Yes.

I certainly would not. 

NO; I would not. 

I think I would want to know more of the factual situation, Senator, and an examination of the data that I simply have not been exposed to before. I could not categorically agree that there is more danger that criminals would be allowed to escape than that they would be subject to tyranny. 

NO.

Yes, I do. I do not know what particular case that was quoted from, but I certainly

I subscribe unequivocally to the statement read. 

I certainly agree that the Court should leave to the Congress the rewriting of statutes.

Under my oath I believe it would have neither the power nor the duty.

I will "do my best not to disappoint you, Senator, should I be confirmed. 

Yes, Senator. 

YOU mean a judge changing his opinion as to what the Constitution or a statute means? 

I do not think there is any lack of fidelity to the Constitution if a judge, after mature consideration, decides that an earlier expression of opinion on his part as to the meaning of a particular clause was in error. 

He certainly does have the same obligation, in my opinion, Senator. I would add only the qualification that he must take into consideration the reasoning and the strength of the earlier precedents which really is a part of the Constitution.

I see no difference. 

It may be more difficult for a judge to change his mind from an earlier position taken as a judge, than it is for a judge to change his mind from an earlier position taken as an advocate, since the two roles are so clearly different. But I think the same principles would apply to both. 

Well, I remember a statement attributed to Justice Holmes at one time who said he was always suspicious of an advocate who came before the Supreme Court saying this was a court of justice, because he felt it was a court of law. I do not see any irreconcilable conflict in those two statements. I think if we say justice under law, that that is a very happy resolution. But the suggestion that the function of the judge is to deliver justice, in the sense of meting out what he personally conceives to be justice, quite apart from the Contitution or law, I would have to reject. 

Certainly my experience, in researching constitutional cases as a private lawyer, or as the Assistant Attorney General, has satisfied me that the due process clause of both the fifth and the 14th amendments is an extremely broad one and difficult to pin down, as an expression of constitutional law. And there is also no doubt in my mind that each of us, the Justices who have been confirmed in the past and I, if I were to be confirmed, would take to the Court what I am at the present time. There is no escaping it. I have lived for 47 years, and that goes with me. But I would hope that broad as the due process clause is, or broad as any other clause of the Constitution might be, I will try to divorce my personal views as to what I thought it ought to mean from what I conceived the framers to have intended. 

Very true. 

I have given it some further thought, Senator, and I would say that I have no reservation at all about what I said from the point of view of the Senate.I think I did not fully appreciate the difficulty of the position that the nominee is in.[Laughter.] I say that not entirely facetiously, because the nominee is in an extraordinarily difficult position. He cannot answer a question which would try to engage him in predictions as to what he would do on a specific fact situation or a particular doctrine after it reaches the Court. And yet, any member of the committee is clearly entitled to probe as to what might be called, for lack of better words, the judicial philosophy of the nominee. I think that is the right and the prerogative of any Senator who feels that is an appropriate test, and it would be presumptuous of me, perhaps, to even say that. But, I have no disagreement at all with my earlier statement in the Harvard Law Record that it certainly is a legitimate concern of the Senate if it chooses to make it so, what the judicial philosophy of the nominee is. 

It is so difficult to do it in meaningful terms. 

AS you suggest, Senator, I cannot speak for the President on the subject. I can give you my own observations. I suppose it is conceivable that one might feel that the two weie consistent if he also felt from his own study of decided cases that the pendulum had been swung too far toward the accused not by virtue of a fair reading of the Constitution but by virtue of what was conceived to be some outside influences such as the personal philosophy of one or more of the Justices. 

I would certainly expect that I would have a personal philosophy. I mean, I have lived 47 years. 

Well, my personal philosophy I would hope to disassociate to the greatest possible extent from my role as a judge. 

Unequivocally. 

Without hesitation. 

I would react to it in this way, Senator, recalling as best I can my thoughts when I penned those words some—what was it?—13 or 14 years ago. I would say that I had no intention then, and certainly would not say now, that Justice Black, who authored the opinion, or the others who concurred with the opinion, wrote it because they were sympathetic with Communism. I think the language I used was meant to suggest that they sympathize with the plight of unpopular groups, such as Communists, and I certainly did not mean to suggest that this is an illegitimate sympathy, but I did not feel that sympathy any more than any other sympathy ought to be read into the Constitution. 

NO; I do not believe it would. 

I think I meant the latter. 

Yes; that was roughly the same time as the Schware and Konigsberg cases being handed down, which I did take the time to study, as a private practitioner, albeit without the benefit of briefs and arguments. And I felt that given my best lights on the subject at the time, that Justice Harlan's dissent was the better view of the Constitution. 

Yes.

Your recollection is probably clearer on it than mine is, Senator.

New Mexico. 

Did I answer your question, Senator? 

Well, not only, had I anticipated today, but were I to rewrite it, without any prospect of a confirmation hearing, I do not think I would have used the term "political philosophy." But I think that my same observations would obtain. 

Well, I certainly perceive limits in the first amendment, in the fourth amendment, and without reading a catalogue, I suspect there are other limits.

Well, given the latter qualification, I would think it was improper and a misuse of executive authority. I testified before Senator Ervin's subcommittee that surveillance of a Member of Congress, and we were discussing surveillance in a public area, so to speak, of public meetings, public street, that sort of thing, was not per se unconstitutional.I also added that the only legitimate use of surveillance was either in the effort to apprehend or solve a crime, or prevent the commission of a crime, and I think I said at that time that surveillance has no proper role whatsoever in the area of where it is simply dissent rather than an effort to apprehend a criminal.

The harassment element was something I had not really considered in my testimony before Senator Ervin, and while I think it would be inappropriate for me to express a particular view of the particular facts, I would say that certainly it was not my intent to rule out careful consideration of that aspect of the thing. 

It certainly is the purpose to put restraints on the Government. 

Well, it might have something to do with the prudence or the wisdom of the decision, but it certainly has nothing to do with the soundness.

All I meant to say was I do not feel prudence or wisdom are necessarily the first test of a constitutional decision. If that is what the Constitution calls for, the fact that the police are handcuffed as a result is no argument against it.

Well, I certainly understand your interest, Senator. The expression of a view of a nominee on the constitutionality of a measure pending in Congress, I feel the nominee simply cannot answer. If it is a question of public statements I have made, as the rational basis for them as a lawyer, I would be happy to try to go into it.

Well, insofar as the antiwar amendments would attempt to limit the President's authority to preserve the lives or safety of men already lawfully in the field, I had reservations about the constitutionality, which I expressed.

AS I recall there were a number of amendments pending in the Congress, quite varying in their approach, and my recollection is not sufficiently good to recall the text of any of them. But I am sure I felt with at least the most restrictive that there was a constitutional problem.

Certainly. 

Let me answer it this way: To me, the question of Congress' authority to cut off funds under the appropriation power of the first amendment is so clear that I have no hesitancy in saying so, because I do not regard that as a debatable constitutional question. I think if one were again to get to the more restrictive types of amendments that were pending last year, there is some area of debatability, and it would be improper for me to answer that. 

Well, I am on record in a discussion before, again, one of the meetings of Senator Ervin's subcommittee as saying, andI think it is in these words, that I do not believe Congress has the authority, given the situation that existed in 1970, to tell the President that he shall not try another attack on Hamburger Hill. I believe that to be a well-reasoned advocate's statement of position, and I do not recall the full

Well, I 

Yes. I think I recognize it. 

It was a misguided and unwarranted use of force. 

This again, this type of question again poses a difficult problem for me, Senator, because there is clearly a lawyerclient relationship here. And if you are inquiring about any advice I have given to a private client, it would be unthinkable for me to testify to it.Nonetheless, my role has been one in reform of public office, and I am bound to say that I think you are entitled to get something more out of me than simply saying on every occasion that there is a lawyerclient relationship. This one is easy for me because he never asked me.

I believe that was where we left this morning, Senator. 

YOU mean urging the Attorney General to call a grand jury? 

NO; I did not.

Well, again, judging from the newspaper accounts I do not see how anyone could help but be distressed by what happened there. And the primary source of distress is the death of the students. I think one cannot help but be distressed over the position the National Guardsmen were put in. That does not justify what they did. But, so far as my own official responsibilities are concerned, our office is primarily a responder rather than an initiator. We are not an operatingdivision and the primary initiative in this area would be the Civil Rights Division.

And I do not believe I have ever thought it proper to simply jump into somebody else's bailiwick and say: Let us do this. 

Well, my impression is that this was undertaken at the behest of the Defense and the State Departments. 

Well, I would not be at all surprised if they had been given hearings in the Civil Rights Division, just as the Defense and State Departments were given hearings presumably in the Internal Security Division in connection with the Pentagon papers. 

NO; I did not.

SO far as the criminal aspect of the Pentagon papers situation as compared to the criminal aspects of the Kent State grand jury prosecutions I am simply not familiar enough with either of those to comment personnally. You are not asking me for my personal comments. I take it you are asking me what is a younger person going to think seeing it?

Just to read newspaper accounts without any full understanding of what may have been very different differentiations between the two situations, I think very likely many young people may have felt that one is not being treated the same as the other. That would not be my own personal opinion, but you are asking mewhat I think a young person might think simply on the basis of media accounts.

But, I am a lawyer, Senator Kennedy, and as a lawyer I feel that I would not make or jump to a conclusion that the disparity in time meant a disparity in the quality of justice administered without having a rather thorough knowledge of the factual situation, which I simply do not have.

I can answer generally to the effect that I think Congress has very significant oversight authority in connection with the operation of the executive branch. Whether that authority would extend to this particular situation or not I am simply not prepared to say.

Yes; I can see a reason. 

Correspondence across my desk between you and the Attorney General, and again, I feel free here since it has gone out of the Department to comment on it to the extend of my input, and I think you are entitled to get that, that some 30 years ago when Justice Jackson was an attorney general he wrote an opinion refusing the request of Carl Vinson, who was then chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee. Chairman Vinson had requested that his committee be furnished with FBI reports, and Justice Jackson in his opinion made what I felt was an extremely sound argument for the proposition that investigative files in the executive branch ought not be furnished to the legislative branch, both because of possible unfairness to the prosecution and possible unfairness to the potential defendants. 

It is a branch of the doctrine of executive privilege. 

That is a question of fact, Senator. 

NO; I am certainly not, but I am suggesting that I think the executive branch is entitled to consider, in analyzing that type of request, its past experience as to congressional committees maintaining a pledge of executive session type of confidentiality. And I certainly do not suggest that I know anything about the facts in connection with your own particular committee that would lead me to think that it would not be kept confidential. 

Well, as I understand it, and I am simply recalling the correspondence, and I do not think there was any offer of executive sessions.

I think to the extent to which I can answer that question, with the sense that I am adviser to the Attorney General, I would sa3" that that would be an added factor to be weighed in the case.

I do not know that much about it, Senator. 

My impression is that some of it was made available in an unknown quantity. So far as my knowledge is concerned, it was made available to the prosecuting attorneys in the State of Ohio. 

YOU realize, of course, I am sure, the difficulty that that question poses for me because of my relationship with the Attorney General. It does seem to me that because the Government ultimately took a public legal position and argued the matter in the courts, that I would not be breaching the attorney-client relationship to answer your question.I am hesitant, but I believe that I am right in saying that I had a slipped disk operation in the latter part of May, and was either at home in bed or in the hospital until about the latter part of the second week in June. I am just tiying to recall from memorj^. Then I started coming back into the office half days, and found that I was overdoing the first couple of days, so I stayed out again, And I think it was either on a Monday or Tuesday I was back in, perhaps for the third time, on a half-day basis, and the Attorney General advised me that the Internal Security Division was going to file papers that afternoon in New York to seek a preliminary restraining order and asked me if I saw any problem with it. And it was a short-time deadline, and I rather hurriedly called such of the members of my staff together as I was able to get.When we reviewed it we came across Near v. Minnesota, and advised the Attorne}T General that basically it was a factual question so far as we could tell. If the type of documents that were about to be published came within the definitional language used by Chief JusticeHughes in Near v. Minnesota there was a reasonable possibility that the Government would succeed in the action.I believe I had one other conference with the Attorney General, and I think that was as to who should appear for the United States in the proceedings in New York and in the second circuit. I then went to the beach for a week during which time the arguments took place in the Courts of Appeal, and I think the Supreme Court case was argued while I was at the beach, too, and I had no further involvement in it than that.

I do not think it is proper for me to answer that question, Senator. That has just been before the Supreme Court. If you want me to tell you what I understand the law to be as of now, I am not at all sure you would be interested in my account of that, and I think my own opinion is something that is simply too close to the type of question I would be asked to describe if I were confirmed, so that I ought not to answer it.

I would be reluctant to get into much detail in that for the same reason. I certainly have not quarrel with the language in the per curiam opinion that the Supreme Court handed down in connection with the New York Times case that prior restraint comes before this Court with a heavy burden on it. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go further than that.

I believe it is very important. 

Well, I think it would be inconceivable for a democracy to function effectively without a free press, because I think that the democracy depends in an extraoridnarily large degree on an informed public opinion. The only chance that the "outs," or those who do not presently control the Government, have to prevail at the next election is to make their views known and the press is one of the principal, probably the principal media in the country through which that can be accomplished. 1 believe it is a fundamental underpinning of a democratic society. Senator Kennedy. What would be your view—would you permit, say, the suppression by injunction of a newspaper that advocated violence? What could you tell us?Mr. REHNQUIST. I think that is too close, Senator. I would decline to answer that.

Well, I am not the first nominee that you or your fellow Senators on the Judiciary Committee have had this problem with. And I can fully sense the problem you have, and surely you can sense the problem that the nominee has, too. Past nominees have generally confined themselves to fairly general expressions, which I am sure are less than satisfying to the Senators. But, in the same token, to start discoursing on one's view, if one has a view, of of what the law should be in particular cases, or what he thinks the Constitution should be in particular cases, would strike me as entirely unappropriate.

I simply do not feel I can answer, properly answer the question about the constitutional principles that would be applied to a newspaper that advocates violence. I think that is too close to the kind of question that might come before or one might be called upon to answer as a Justice of the Supreme Court. I would be glad to try to respond to some other question.

I would say one would be the extraordinarily and presumably very rare situation contemplated by the language in Near v. Minnesota where you had the prospect of a newspaper publishing troop movements or troopship sailings with an extraordinarily high degree of danger, not to Government policy, but to the lives of the men who are engaged in the service of the Government.

That is what bothers me about it. 

I am trying to think of cases that have 

Just to give me, you know, ideas of what arguments have been made. I think we presently have under submission somewhere in the Government a brief on behalf of the NewspaperPublisher's Association that they should be exempt from the price freeze because of freedom of the press.Now, I have not had an occasion to review the merits of that brief, and I doubt that I will in my official capacity, because it belongs to another department. I would think that a newspaper's claim on the grounds of freedom of the press to be exempted from very unevenhanded types or even-handed types of economic relations such as the antitrust laws, the copyright laws, and a price control law, the interest of the Government in applying economic legislation uniformly so long as it is not hostilely inclined to the press would be another interest one would have to consider against the claim of freedom of the press in a situation like that.

I have said I place an extraordinarly high value on it, and I do not blame you for feeling you want something more specific than just a rather, what you may well consider, pious declaration, and yet I find that when one tries to elaborate specifics they tend to be things no one would disagree with or else we get into an area where the matter is likely to come before the court in some form.

My initial reaction was that we had very little time to come to a decision.

If you let me go on, because I am going to do the best I can to answer your question.

What do you mean by "might anticipate what the final outcome was going to be"?

I never felt I knew enough about the facts, which 1 really knew nothing about, to make an assessment. I felt it would turn on the facts, and I did not know what the facts were.

This presents me with the same sort of problem, which I must resolve for myself, realizing that if I resolve it against answering anybody on the committee, or anybody in the Senate, is entitled to hold against me my refusal to answer.I did speak publicly on the May Day matter down in North Carolina 2 or 3 days after it and I, therefore, feel that I do owe an obligation to the committee to describe at least in a general nature my role, without necessarily, without revealing, and "revealing" probably is not the right word, describing the various internal deliberations that went on in the Department. And this is a difficult line to walk.I will try to walk it. My role, up until the time of the events that actually took place was being consulted as to the propriety of the useof the Federal troops in certain situations under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 331 through 334. And I drafted an opinion which the Attorney General gave to the Secretary of Defense, saying that it was legally permissible to use Federal troops in order to preserve the operation of the Federal Government under the situation where a fairly large number of people had announced their intention to shut it down.And that opinion was transmitted by the Attorney General to the Secretary of Defense. I participated in two or three meetings over the weekend, immediately prior to the demonstrations, at which a good number of peple were present. I do not really think I had any significant input or contribution to make at those meetings.During the time the events were actually happening, I was in and out of the Attorney General's office. I was at a large meeting in the Criminal Division at which a number of people from the Corporation Counsel's office, the U.S. Attorney's Office, our Criminal Division, our Internal Security Division, were present.I do not believe I remained long, and since my own knowledge of the local practice of arraignment and arrest and that sort of thing is not very large, I found I had very little to contribute. There may have been more, but that is all that occurs to me now.

One decision reached at a meeting that I was at over the weekend, was that the permit should be revoked for the campground down at Hains Point, I believe it was. I made no objection to that decision.

I believe you have misread mj statement, Senator. 

Yes.

I made a statement saying that the abandonment of the field arrest procedures and the consequent, or perhaps not necessarily consequent, delay in bringing the defendants before an arresting magistrate, or a committing magistrate, was, I thought, defensible because the requirements that a defendant be brought before a magistrate were that he be brought before the magistrate within a reasonable time, and that in my opinion a reasonable time in this situation should take into consideration the necessity of the arresting officer, having made the arrest, continuing to be in the field to prevent the occurrence of other violence.I went on to say in the statement in Boone that in a situation more serious than that which prevailed in Washington on May Day, the doctrine of qualified martial law had on occasion been invoked. I made, I thought, quite clear, not only that it had not been invoked in69-267—71 4Washington, but that it would be justified only in a more aggravated situation.

I certainly am suggesting that. 

Well, knowing the volume of arrests which were made, I simply would not be in a position to comment on whether any particular arrest was made with or without 

Well, I stand by the language I used in North Carolina, and I would call it something less than a general endorsement of everything that was done on May Day. 

Well, I would have to know more about the facts to be satisfied that a particular thing done was not right. I did specifically say that I thought the abandonment of the field arrest forms by Chief Wilson was a legitimate and proper decision under the circumstances which he had to, I understand, confront. 

I do not think arresting without probable cause is ever proper, and if, in fact, it happened on May Day, I do not agree with it. I do not know enough about the facts to say that there were or were not arrests without probable cause on May Day. 

That is my understanding. 

It suggests to me that whereas there may have been probably cause for the arrest of the great number of people, the District of Columbia police were faced with such an overwhelming situation of violation of the law that they chose to try to keep the streets free, and rather than to preserve the necessary information that would enable them to later show either that there had been probable cause for an arrest, or probable cause to bind a man over. 

I am not satisfied that they did arrest a lot of people who were innocent.

Could I have the question repeated? Could I have either the reporter read the question back or 

1 think one thing that happened was that the number of people who were to be involved in May Day was an overwhelmingly large number, larger than the Metropolitan Police contemplated. As a result, they were faced with a choice of either, when an individual policeman arrested a law violator, or someone he thought was a law violator, of himself taking that man to the stationhouse, booking him, and going through the usual procedures, or simply having the man taken in some other manner to the stationhouse. And the policemen then would stay on the streets to try to arrest the next bunch who were coming along. And as I understand it, they were very deliberately tr3Ting to obstruct the movement of traffic, frequently by hazardous means. I think the District police opted in favor of the latter choice, and I cannot find it in myself to fault them for it. 

NO; I would not interpret my final answer that way.

I think what I said was that the Chief of the Metropolitan Police made a decision to abandon field arrest forms and run some risk of being unable to follow up on the prosecution of arrestees in the interest of keeping his forces on the street in order to preserve order, and that I could not faults him for that decision. Senatoi KENNEDY. IS there any procedure that was used during the course of that day, related to regulations, rules, or procedures which were established within the Justice Department, that you would have disagreed with? Mr. REHNQUIST. Well, the abandonment of field arrest forms, as I understand it, there was no decision taken within the Department. 

I was involved in some of the decisions, Senator. I suspect there were a great many that I was not involved in. It is, of course, relatively easy to look back in hindsight and say that one would have done something differently. And the one thing that occurs to me, and this is strictly a matter of hindsight, and I do not believe this was something that could have been fairty anticipated, was to supply more adequate facilities for those who were detained. 

Well, you have made the statement that there were arrests made without probable cause simply as bystanders and people who were walking to work. If that was the case I would certainly have done that differently. 

NO; I did not.

Well, certainly after newspaper accounts occurred one could not rule out that possibility.

Well, it certainly struck me after reading the stories in the newspapers, that if those accounts were true, people have been improperly arrested.

By the time the newspaper accounts occurred, I think whatever had happened had happened and the Corporation Counsel and United State's Attorney's Office, as I understand it, were already engaged in a screening process. I did not do anything. 1 did not feel there was anything that would be appropriate for me to do.

My statement in North Carolina, Senator, as I recall it, and as I see it, glancing through it, dealt with the abandonment of field-arrest forms, and the concept of a reasonable time in which to take a person before a committing magistrate. It did not purport to sweepingly endorse everything that had been done during the May Day demonstrations.As to what I may have done on m}7 own, my own initiative, after becoming aware, I have already answered that I did nothing, and I did not think it was appropriate to do anything.

I do not concede it to be a general endorsement. 

I am sure that I made a comment, Senator, to someone at some time that if these newspaper stories were true, certainly they arrested some people they should not have.

I can remember my own reaction to the newspaper stories, thinking that there are always two sides to a case, and I would want to hear the other side before making a decision, but at the same time, feeling if this was true it was wrong.

I am not sufficiently close to the actual operations in the field to have the necessary information to make a judgment as to whether particular procedures should be changed.As to the overall impression of the thing, the fact that there was not a serious injury, no loss of life, and that the Federal Capital was kept open, I think was a rather significant accomplishment.Now, if it could have been done without arresting anyone who should not have been arrested, if that did, indeed, happen, then it would be better to do it that way. Whether there is some system that could be devised with some several thousand individual policemen to insure that no one would ever be arrested without probable cause, I simply do not know.

Well, yes, that there must be probable cause to arrest.

Yes.

I face the same decision here. 

NO; it is attorney-client relationship. 

My client, in my position as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, is the Attorney General, and the President, and applying—-— 

Well, that puts the rest of the Consitution in the position of having someone advising them as to what his interpre-tation of the Constitution is. Presumably, each of them, being very busy men, they need to get that advice from somewhere, and they get it from me and they get it from other sources, also. But, the traditional role of the attorney-client privilege is that the attorney does not disclose advice given to his client and not otherwise made public.In the wiretapping situation, the Government has filed a brief in the Supreme Court of the United States, which is a matter of public record, and I would be happy to comment on my rather limited role in the preparation of that brief.

It was drafted in the Internal Security Division, and at the request of the Attorney General we were asked to work with the Internal Security Division in preparing the draft and revising it. We did that. It was then submitted to the Solicitor General in the usual course of events, and was finally filed after having been revised by him in the Supreme Court of the United States. 

I think that disqualification is a judicial act, Senator, just as one's vote to affirm or reverse a particular decision would be a judicial act and, therefore, I think it would be improper for me to express any opinion as to how I would act in a particular case. I think I mentioned to you when I was in your office the other day, and I now state publicly, that the memorandum prepared by the Office of Legal Counsel for Justice White, at the time he went to the court, strikes me as being a sound legal analysis of the basis on which one should disqualify himself. At least the thrust of that brief is personal participation in litigation 

Well, I think advising as to particular litigation it does cover. 

'MJ recollection is that it does not. 

I think that is a good deal more difficult question, Senator, and I think that I would have to say that I would do the best with the materials and precedents available to me. 

The factors will be the applicable disqualifications statutes which I recall are 28 U.S.C. 455, the factors set forth in that statute, and to the extent that the canons of judicial ethics would not be inconsistent with statute, the canons of judicial ethics. 

I obviously ought not to say that I will disqualify myself in the wiretapping case. I can say that in my opinion I person-ally participated in an advisory capacit}' in the preparation of that brief, and I will attempt to apply the standards, as I understand them, to that decision.

Senator, you are asking me as to a particular decision that I will make after I get on the court. I have said enough on that, I think, and you can draw }Tour own conclusions.

I am sure I have. 

Yes.

YOU mean how I got the numbers of—— 

Well, given the numbers, which I do not recall, but it seems to me it was something in the neighborhood of between 100 and 200, and the fact that there are 200 million citizens in the country, and presumably millions and millions of phones, I felt justified in saying that any number between 100 and 200 could not possibly be said to be pervasive. 

That is my understanding under the Omnibus Crime and Safe Streets Act of 1968. 

Yes; as set forth in the statute. 

Well, I can tell you nothing from personal knowledge. 

I am not sure whether I did or not. As I recall the latter number is somewhere between 30 and 40, so that whether or not I included it it would not change nry conclusion as to pervasiveness. 

That means that at a particular time there were 30 to 40, and I simply do not recall the figure, and I am trying to get it out of my memory generally, of this type of wiretap used. 

My understanding is not sufficiently great factually to be able to answer that.

I think it would be inappropriate for me to do so, Senator. I have acted as a spokesman and advocate in preparing a brief for the Government, and I think it would be inappropriate for me to express a personal view.

AS to when a wiretap ought to be used? 

In cases contained in the reservation of the act of 1968, as defined in the statutory language. 

I simply do not know. I do not have any part in the operational end of it. 

I think, having acted as an advocate and spokesman for the Department it would be inappropriate for me to give a personal view. 

Well, I can make a general comment. 

Well, I think my comment must be sufficiently general that it is not going to satisfy you. It is, having indicated in my London speech, it is not an appealing t}-pe of thing, and it is justified only by exigent circumstances. 

I was acting as a spokesman for the Department in London, and I have acted as a spokesman for the Department in other instances and in the preparation of the brief, and for that reason I do not think I should give my personal views. 

I do not think that one who has been an advocate, in a particular matter, particularly when it is under submission to the courts, is at all entitled to express a personal view. 

Everybody from the Justice Department does, I think. And you know, they do not want some either/or type of presentation. They want a justification of the Department position, and that is what I attempted to give them. 

Well, I will say this much, Senator, that certainly if I had felt from an advocate's point of view that the Department's position was indefensible, or personally obnoxious to me, I would have resigned. 

I did.

YOU are characterizing my letter, Senator. 

I do not have it in front of me. I am sure the text is available to everybody. 

I will try and answer any question about it. I do have some resistance about accepting a characterizing

TO the extent I recall the letter—I certainly recall the substance of it—it was basically an argument that those who attacked Judge Carswell's civil rights record were at least in part in error and that in addition, although the attack on his civil rights record might demand a good deal of popular support, the idea that it was solely a question of civil rights, and not also a question of other constitutional doctrines being involved, was a matter that should be more fairly presented.

I think the letter has to speak for itself, Senator. I certainly wrote it as an advocate. I think it is a very defensible piece of advocacy.

The letter is there; it is a matter of record. I wrote it. I think anyone is entitled to draw what fair inferences he feels can be made from it.

It is a matter of reasoned individual judgment. 

I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what the President's thought processes were, if I knew them.

Well, if by judicial conservative is meant one who will attempt to •

I simply cannot speak for him, Senator. 

Well, let me tell what I think 1 am, and then you decide whether I am a judicial conservative or not. My notion would be that one attempts to ascertain a constitutional meaning much as suggested by Senator McClellan's questions earlier, by the use of the language used by the framers, the historical materials available, and the precedents which other Justices of the Supreme Court have decided in cases involving a particular provision. 

Could you be any more specific? 

I think the comment I made, if you are referring to my University of Arizona speech, was in the Justice Department, like any other litigant, they had a perfect right to request the Court to review, and if it found it appropriate, overrule a precedent. 

Let me try.

TO the extent that I believe it proper, and it is a very unenviable task for a nominee, I am sure you realize, to the extent that a decision is not only unanimous at the time it is handed down, but has been repeatedly reaffirmed by a changing group of judges, such as Brown v. Board of Education, it seems to me there is no question but what that is the law of the land, that the one wa}r you try to arrive at the meaning of the Constitution is to try to see what the nine other Justices who took the oath of office thought it meant at the time they were faced with the question. On the other hand, to the extent that a precedent is not that authoritative in the sense of having stood for a shorter period of time, or having been handed down by a sharply divided court, then it is of less weight as a precedent.That is not to say that there is not a presumption in favor of precedent In every instance.I do not feel I can say moie without commenting on matters that actually might come before the Court.

I feel I have got to restrain myself. I have gone' as far as it seems to me a nominee ought to in indicating the way I conceive precedent to be applicable. I think anything——

Well, I think it is very important. 

Well, no; phrased the way you do, it certainly does not. 

Well, the idea that people's vote should be counted equally strikes me as something that virtually everyone in the room should agree to. But if you are putting it in a context of a particular fact question that might come before the Supreme Court—-—

I have done my best to indicate the use of precedent, and I simply fear that if one gets into particular issues, he is taking the position that is very inappropriate for a nominee. 

Yes, it is, Senator.

NO; I went on to Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, for one quarter, at which time I turned 18, and then I entered the Army Air Force.

Yes.

Yes; I graduate in 1948. 

Yes.

That is correct. 

Yes; it is.

It might be somewhat difficult to compile. I am sure it could be done.

It was a partnership, not a corporation, and I began representing it, I believe, in about 1960 or 1961.

They had a feed-lot operation and a cattle feeding operation. They had been growing cotton, but, as I recall, were getting out of it by the time I came to represent them, and they had purchased a fair amount of land along the Colorado River, which was my principal association with them, the litigation arising out of that purchase.

Lease, the acquisition of land; then, the lawsuit to determine title to the land, though I am sure I may have represented them on occasional land acquisitions.

Yes; I believe it is, Senator. When I first began representing them it was a locally owned company but still,, between that time and the time I left Phoenix, it was acquired by Transamerica.Seiiatoi BAYH. What was the name of the locally owned company? Mr. REHNQUIST. Phoenix Title & Trust. 

Well, my lepresentation of them was in litigation which they got into as the result of acting as escrow agent or trustee under a subdivision trust. Their business, as such, was to act as escrow agent am1 trustee in very large volume land transactions that occurred in the State of Arizona. 

Defendant and litigation. You know, 1 can give you a description of perhaps the last piece of litigation I represented them on.

1 believe I began representing them in 1963. Perhaps, it was 1962, and my principal representation was of the highway department, as a condeniner of lands necessary for the construction of highways. L was retained by them in at least one instance to defend them against the charge of improper maintenance and construction of a highway where a personal injury and death bad resulted from a collision on the highway, State highway.

I believe I am, yes. 

TO the best of my knowledge, yes. It is general and it is approximate, but I think it presents an unfortunately fair position of my financial position. 

Yes.

Those are 1969 letters? 

DO 3"OU want my present opinion? 

Well, I am inclined to agree with the comment that Judge Blackmun made during his confirmation hearings to the effect that judges generally, after the Senate's denial of confirmation to Judge Haynsworth, had become more sensitive and perhaps more astute to disqualify themselves than they had previously. So that my own inclination would be, applying the standards laid down by 28 U.S.C. 455, and to the extent there is no conflict between them and the canons of judicial ethics, to try to follow that sort of stricter standards that 1 think the Senate, by its vote, indicated should prevail. 

That is a difficult question for me, Senator, because certainly a literal reading of 28 U.S.C. 455 does not, as I recall the statute, seem to require that. 

A substantial interest in the case, not in the party. Yet there is no question that the arguments were made in the minority report of the Senate committee, and on the floor, that were persuasive to many Senators that the canons of the ABA and the strict interpretation of those canons which says that a judge disqualifies himself if he owns stock in a case should be followed. I do not think it would be appropriate for me to simply say right now that I would or would not disqualify myself if I had a share of stock, since I think that is a judicial decision. I think that I can fairly sa,j that I am sensitive, as Judge Blackmun indicated he was, to the closer and perhaps stricter view of disqualification that has prevailed since the Haynsworth decision. 

YOU think I should answer a question as to whether I would disqualify myself, if confirmed, if I owned a share of stock in a corporation?

But I think it would be singularly inappropriate, Senator, just because of that factor, for me now to try and announce to you how I will rule on that case. I have said I think there is an increased sensitivity, increased strictness, in the views of the disqualification statutes, and I think it would be inappropriate for me to say flatly what rule of law I would propose to apply if I were confirmed. 

Yes. I have no hesitancy in doing that. Since you are basically examining my professional qualifications as an advocate, we did not give to the committee that case because we did not find it. 

NO; we did not. We ran it down under the key note system, under "Disqualification," as I recall. Partly it was staff; partly, I remember going through these volumes, myself, and as I recall, the Commonwealth Coating simply did not show up. Now, obviously, one can be faulted for less than complete coverage in the cases on that point. I admit that, had I found the Commonwealth Coating at the time I wrote the letter, I certainly would have felt obligated to comment on it. I would not have felt that it changed the result which I reached in the letter.

Well, as suggested, Senator Bayh, Mr. Frank, in his testimony before the committee, I think he also was of the view that that case was not controlling. It was basically dealing with an arbitration case and a somewhat different factual situation. 

Yes, I do.

It is difficult to answer that question, Senator. I have participated in the political process in Arizona. I have represented indigent defendants in the Federal and State courts in Arizona. I have been a member of the County Legal Aid Society Board at a time when it was very difficult to get this sort of funding that they are getting today. I have represented indigents in civil rights actions. 1 realize that that is not, perhaps, a very impressive list. It is all that comes to mind now.

Well, can you give me some example of what you have in mind?

TO protect individuals and their homes against unreasonable searches and seizures.

That might be another way of putting it. 

[ think the Supreme Court has held that the fourth amendment applies to State and local governments as well as to the Federal Government. 

Yes; T believe it is. Do you want me to answer? 

Yes.

I have no idea whether it was a correct quotation. I can certainly remember in substance defending the administration's position on national security wiretapping, which has since been embodied in a brief in the Supreme Court of the United States.I cannot, at this time, recall the words I used. 

AS I said to Senator Kennedy, Senator Bayh, I think it inappropriate in a case in which I have appeared as an advocate to now give personal views. 

The format of the college visits which I participated in, 10 or 12 last year, was very simple: "Come and defend the Justice Department to the college students." They certainly would regard it as a lawyer-client relationship. 

Well, I doubt that you can find any statement, Senator, in which I have suggested that the Government should be given carte blanche authority to bug or wiretap. I recently made a statement at a forum in the New School for Social Research up in New York, attended by Mr. Mear of the Civil Liberties Union and Mr. Katzenbach, that I thought the Government had every reason to be satisfied with the limitations in the Omnibus Crime Act of 1968.

Well, it was dealt with to the extent that Congress made it clear that the limitations being imposed by that act were not to be carried over into that type of case.

I think that is a fairly debatable legal question. 

I think, again, having participated in the preparation of the Government's brief—the Government's brief which is on file in the Supreme Court of the United States—I think it wTould be inappropriate for me to give a personal opinion. 

I can tell you the position which the Government has taken and which I believe is a reasonably well done job of advocacy, and that is that given the facts, five preceding administrations have all taken the position that national security type of surveillance is permissible, that one Justice of the Supreme Court has expressed the view that the power does exist, two have expressedthe view that it does not exist, one has expressed the view that itdoes not exist, one has expressed the view that it is an open question, that Government is entirely justified in presenting the matter to the Court for its determination.

T think it would be inappropriate. 

I think the Department has taken the position that this is a distinction that is virtually impossible to make. Their position is taken on the basis of operational divisions with the knowledge of which I am not familiar, but I do not think it would be appropriate for me to make a personal observation. 

With the qualification that the surveillance ought to be in the interest of either apprehending criminals or preventing the commission of crime, and with the additional qualification that the surveillance talked about there is not wiretapping and it is not forcibly extracting information. It is simply the viewing in a public place. 

I feel is—what? 

My statement was, I believe, that I did not feel it was a violation of the first amendment. The question of whether it is warranted or not is a good deal different one it seems to me. The question of proper use of executive manpower, you know, with the idea of compiling dossiers on political figures, such as was being done by the Army at one time, strikes me as nonsense. 

I expressed that view at the time of the hearing before the Ervin committee. I was speaking for the Department, and I will stand by that statement. 

Well, I do not disagree with you at all, but it would seem to have no meaningful purpose to me.Even in my examination of the cases as a Justice Department lawyer, I was unwilling, and I did not feel that the precedents suggested that everything that was undesirable or meaningless was unconstitutional.

Can I answer that? I mean, Congress has it within its power any time it chooses to regulate the use of investigatory personnel on the part of the executive branch. It has the power as it did in the Omnibus Crime Act of 1968 of saying that Federal personnelsh all wiretap only under certain rather strictly defined standards. That is certainly one very available way of protecting. 

Speaking as a Justice Department advocate, as I was at the time, I think that a couple of earlier sentences immediately preceding the one you read, Senator, summarized the view that legislation tailored to meet specific evils would not receive the categorical opposition of the Department. I think, from the law enforcement point of view, we were skeptical of the notion that some sort of judicial hearing should be required before an investigation be even undertaken which, I think, would have the most deleterious effect on effective law enforcement, in effect, preventing the commencement of an investigation which might ultimately end up in a showing of probable cause before the investigation could even start. 

I think the LEAA bill sent up, in response to Senator Mathias' amendment to the LEAA Act of 1970, presents what struck me at the time I had a chance to look at it as a reasonable accommodation of the interests. 

In that it prevents the wholesale dissemination of criminal history information; it prevents almost completely thedissemination of criminal investigative information. It confers, in some cases, a right of private action for someone who is wronged by that. I do not pretend to carry in my mind even all of the significant provisions of the act, but it seems to me those were some of them.

I think it can go a long way, yes. 

I agree with that statement. My remarks before Senator Ervin's committee were in a context of the existence of the Bill of Rights, the existence of the statutory restrictions such as were contained in the 1968 act. And the question, as I understand it, was what additional statutory prescriptions should be placed on investigative processes.

Well, you are talking about a court warrant before you commence an investigation?

Well, you are required to get one now.

Well, as to whether Congress ought to enact legislation like this, I would not express any opinion. Our position in the brief in the Supreme Court has been that with the existing provisions in the act of 1968, the Constitution does not require that it be done.

YOU mean what would be wrong with passing such a statute?

I honestly do not understand your question, Senator.

I still do not understand. 

I think probably not.;

Yes.I think the ordinance really worked very well in Phoenix. It was readily accepted, and I think I have come to realize since it, more than 1 did at the time, the strong concern that minorities have for the recognition of these rights. I would not feel the same way today about it as I did then.

I think probably not. And if I may explain: My children here go to school out in Fairfax Count}', in schools that are integrated and attended by a minority of blacks. My son plays on a football team, on which both blacks and whites play. He plays on a basketball team on which blacks and whites play, and I feel he is better off for that experience than if he were playing on a team entirely composed of whites. This, however, is done in the context of the neighborhood school. All of these people are in the general geographical area and attend the school because of that. I would still have the same reservations I expressed in 1967 to the accomplishment of this same result by transporting people long distances, from the places where the}' live, in order to achieve this sort of racial balance, and what I would regard as rather an artificial way.

Well, I think that transporting long distances is undersirable for whatever purpose.

Well, in the context of the situation where there has not been de jure segregation, obviously we get into a situation where there are questions pending before the Court, and which it would be inappropriate for me to comment on. T do feel obligated to comment, because I did write the letter to the editor. I think you are entitled to inquire into my personal views on that particular point.

In the context of busing to achieve integration in a situation where it is not a dual school system; I think it is. 

Well 

The courts have held where a situation has pertained in segregation we are required and obligated to redress that balance. That was not the situation to which I was addressing myself in that letter. 

I would not undertake to explain the grounds of the NAACP opposition. I will try to give a fair answer to the specific charges so far as 1968 is concerned. My recollection is 1 had absolutely nothing to do with any sort of poll watching. That is not a completely fair answer or a completely responsive answer, because in earlier years ] did, and they may well have confused 196S with earlier years.My responsibilities, as I recall them, were never those of a challenger, but as one of a group of lawyers working for the Republican Party in Maricoba County who attempted to supply legal advice to persons who were challengers, and I was chairman of Avhat was called the Lawyers Committee in a couple of elections, biennial elections, which I believe were in the early 1960's. And we had situations where our challengers were excluded from precincts where we felt, by law, they were entitled to get into, and 1 might say that our challenging efforts were directed not to black precincts as such but to any precinct where there was a heavy preponderance of Democratic voting, just as our counterparts in the Democratic Party devoted their efforts to precincts in which there was a heavy preponderance of Republican voting.And, as matters worked out, what we finally developed was kind of a system of aibitration whereby my counterpart, who was for a coupleof elections chairman of the Democratic lawyers, and I, the chairman of the Republican lawyers, tried to arbitrate disputes that arose, and frequently the both of us would go together to a polling place and try to decide on the basis of a very hurried view of the facts wTho was in the right and who was in the wrong. And I can remember an occasion in which I felt that a couple of our challengers were being vehement and overbearing in a manner that was neither pioper nor permitted by law and of telling them so. I can also remember situations in which the Democratic poll judges were refusing to allow our challengers to enter the polling place, and I can remember my counterpart insisting that they let them in.So, I do not feel I can fairly be accused in the manner that the NAACP has accused me on the basis of what those activities were.

It was not devoted to minority group areas as such; it was devoted again to areas in which heavy Democratic pluralities were voting together, with some reason to believe that tombstones were being voted at the same time. And this was one of the principal means used to try to find letters returned with the addressee unknown and then to challenge the person on the basis of residence if he appeared to vote.I might say that the Democrats made equal use of the same device. 

I simply cannot speak for them. I know of my own conduct in these matters, and that the letters were mailed out on the basis of mathematical calculations of Democratic votes in precincts together with aueas in which there was some reason to believe that there actually were tombstone or absentee voting, and I know from my trips to polling places, as a member of the Lawyers Committee, that some of the precincts certainly had a number of blacks, a number of chicanos, and many of them were totally white. 

I do not remember the question, Senator. 

Oh, I do, too; I remember the question. 

Well, I certainly did not mean to suggest then or now that the Court at that time was sympathetic to the claims of Communists, because they, themselves, sympathized with communism. I think what I meant to suggest was that was an ideological sympathy with unpopular groups which was not developed from the Constitution itself which may have partaken of the decision. 

Well, I think my answer to that would be "Yes." 

And in a sense I probably should not have answered the last question "Yes," because I think one has got to reserve his complete independence of decision if he is confirmed. I think you are entitled to know my present impressions, and my present impressions are that the memo submitted to Byron White is a good summary of disqualification law, and that it requires disqualification where there has been personal participation, even in an advisory capacity on the preparation of a brief, and that I have participated in the wiretapping brief in an advisory capacity. 

1 would not want to venture an interpretation of the term of counsel, except to suggest I think it could fairly be said to mean "of counsel," as the term is traditionally used in the legal profession, representing a part in court.

Well, just as I understand your problem, you understand mine, Senator. I believe I have tried to give to Senator Kennedy some basic outlines, and however much it may displease you I do not feel I can do more.As I said, a decision that was handed down unanimously and has been unanimously reconsidered by a succeeding group of judges, of which Brown v. Board of Education would be an example, is to my mind the established constitutional law of the land.To the extent that one takes other decisions which were by a closely divided Court more recently, I would regard these precedents as not being as strong, though nonetheless entitled to weight.So far as the power of the Congress to enact civil rights legislation, such as the Public Accommodations Act of 1964, under the commerce clause, on matters like that, I think they have been sufficiently set at rest by a constitutional decision that one need not hesitate to say that that is so.

That is correct, Senator. If you were present when I answered Senator Bayh, I would answer you much the same way, and I 

Well, that was the only one. I never testified against any State legislation. 

Right. 

Right. 

In that context, I think that is a fair interpretation. 

OK. If we broaden it out, I certainly am not prepared to say, as a matter of personal philosophy, that property rights are necessarily at the bottom of the scale. Justice Jackson, for whom I worked, commented shortly before his death that the framers had chosen to join together life, liberty, and property, and he did not feel they should be separated. I think property rights are actually a very important form of individual rights. On the other hand, I am by no means prepared to say that a property right must not on some occasion—and 1 am again speaking personally and not in any sense of the Constitution or statutory construction—but certainly when a legislative decision is made that a property right must give way to what may be called a human right or an individual right, that may frequently be the correct choice. 

I feel that it is improper for me to answer in that context, Senator. 

Yes. I am not.

Senator, my fundamental commitment, if I am confirmed, will be to the greatest extent possible to totally disregard my own personal belief as to whether property is invariably sub-ordinate to individual freedom or whether they must be balanced in some way. I realize that you certainly are not required to take at face value my statement to this effect and that anyone is perfectly free to attach such significance as they will to Senator Ervin's very perceptive comments that what 1 am today is part of what 1 was yesterday, and yet, framed in the constitutional context in which you fran1" it, I think it is improper for me to answer it.

1 was speaking, I think, as a spokesman for the Department in the area of the pretrial detention bill. And T think that the contest of my remarks was that based on a historical unah sis of the cases that personal freedom can be limited by arrest, by detention of a subject, following- a trial, or even to a momentary search under the doctrine of Terry v. Ohio, that these are decisions that have been made by the Supreme Court, and are parameters under which the Justice Department and the Government now operate.

I was giving my best lawyer's view, I would say. as the Assistant Attorney General, of the constitutionality.

NO.

NO; I woidd not. 

Well, I think it is clear from my speech up there that I would not apply that principle to the situation where a person seeks to test the constitutionality of the law. He runs the risk of it being held constitutional, and then he must pay the price exacted by the law. But if the law is held unconstitutional, obviously he is vindicated.

I will bend every effort to do so, Senator, and I would regard myself as a failure as a Justice if I were unable to do so. 

Well, I think the framers drafted a document, Senator Hruska, which was capable of forming a framework of government, not just in 1789, but in our own day. And there is no question in my mind that the principles they laid down then, as subsequently interpreted, must be applied to very changed conditions which occur now rather than then.But, I think even now it is to the Constitution and to its authentic interpretation that we must turn in solving constitutional problems, rather than to simply an outside desire to be "in step with the times."

NO, I do not; and I think specifically the Bill of Rights was designed to prevent exactly that soit of thing, to prevent a majority, perhaps an ephemeral majorit}', from restricting or unduly impinging on the rights of unpopular minorities.

Certainly. 

Yes; it is.

Well, I would certainly not want to comment on any particular matter that would come before the Supreme Court were 1 confirmed in that context. Taking Judge Lumbard's statement as a desirable philosophical approach to the problem of law enforcement, the concomitant development of the rights of individuals, and the efficacy of law enforcement, I certainly have no quarrel with it at all. Ultimately, of course, any such philosophical judgment or legislative judgment is subject to the requirements of the Constitution, and were I confirmed as a Justice of the Supreme Court, it would be the commands of the Constitution, as I understand them, that I would employ in passing judgment on any such measures. 

Well, if in fact the Bill of Rights does produce such an imbalance, we have a problem. But, it is obviously not one that the Justices of the Supreme Court should solve by rewriting the Bill of Rights so that it permits more balance on the side of law enforcement. It seems to me that the type of situation which you are referring to, and perhaps I am poorly paraphrasing your language, is that the preamble and other sections of the Constitution contemplate that the legislative process, shall ultimately govern, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. And that where the Constitution itself, were it to be distorted in meaning, so as to unreasonably restrict what was the intent of the Framers as to the extent of the legislative power, then it would be something that ought to be corrected. 

NO, I was sure it was not. 

Certainly all sections of the Constitution that have any applicability to a case should be considered.

The Philadelphia plan, Senator, was a proposal implemented under the leadership of the Department of Labor to require in the construction trades in Philadelphia, and in other localities where the situation was similar to that which had prevailed in Philadelphia, where in effect statistics and history indicated that minority members were simply not getting into unions, and the construction contractors were depending on union hiring halls to furnish their employees, to require, as a condition of receiving a Government contract, a commitment to achieve, if possible, certain goals of minority hiring. My role was that almost immediately after the plan was announced by the then Labor Secretary Shultz, the Comptroller General of the United States rendered an opinion that in his view the plan was unconstitutional and unauthorized by law. This obviously put the Secretary of Labor in a serious bind and he consulted the Attorney General and requested an Attorney General's opinion on the legality of the plan. With the help of the Solicitor's Office in the Labor Department, and our own Civil Rights Division in the Justice Department, we prepared a draft opinion, which was ultimately signed by the Attorney General, upholding the legality and constitutionality of that plan. 

I do not know that I know that much about it. 

My recollection is that it was the construction trade unions and some of the contractors. 

Well, naturally it would be improper for me to comment in any sense in a situation like that that might come before the Court for review, whether or not I might feel bound to disqualify myself. But certainly it sounds as if Attorney General Kennedy's testimony was very similar to the practice presently followed by the Department of Justice in which it is substantially defended in the brief just filed by the Government in the Supreme Court of the United States, the limitation to national security cases, and the importance of the same to the protection of the Government, itself, that is.

Yes, and we now have 9 additional years of precedent which we have cited in the Department's brief, since Attorney General Kennedy spoke in 1962.

Point Reyes Park in California? No. 

I do not know that it would be elaboration. Senator, but I will certainly do my best to give you my ideas on the subject from, as you might imagine, a very general point of view which I feel is all that I could say at this time.I think that in interpreting the Constitution, one goes first to the document itself, to the historical materials that may be available, casting light on what its framers may have intended, and to the decisions made by the Supreme Court construing it, and I think that precedent is very important in the case of all branches of the law.I think it is important in constitutional law although I think traditionally it is regarded as less binding in the area of constitutional law than it is, for example, in the area of statutory construction.I think it is nonetheless important and an important factor to be considered because basically it represents the judgment of what nine other Justices who took the oath of office to faithfully administer the Constitution thought it meant on the facts before them then. And I think any decision rendered in that matter is entitled to great weight by a subsequent Court in considering the same question.

Yes; I would. 

I would hark back, and it seems to me it was Justice Brandeis in the Ashwander case, although I may be mistaken both as to the Justice and as to the case, where the observation was made that in the case of statutory construction, stare decisis should be given virtually controlling weight because it is always within the power of Congress to change a decision should it feel that the Court has misinterpreted congressional intent, whereas in the area of constitutional law, with the great difficulty of constitutional amendment as opposed to mere revision or amendment of the law by Congress, there is a tendency to be more willing to review a prior piecedent on its merits.

Senator, I have made public statements as Assistant Attorney General in support of the constitutionality of pretrial detention and in support of the Department's position with respect to wiretapping in national security cases.69-267—71 10

I have done that, yes. 

I would say "No, Senator, I think that five administrations have taken that position from the time of Franklin Roosevelt until the time of President Nixon. We worked in an advisory capacity in our office on the Government's brief to be presented to the U.S. Supreme Court in defense of that authority. We worked with the Internal Security- Division people. But we were dealing with materials that had been evolved previously. 

That certainly was our reading of the exchanges of correspondence between the Attor:ie}*s General and the Presidents. 

That is correct, with this qualification, Senator: had I felt the positions I was taking or the doctrines I was espousing were utterty obnoxious to me personally, I simply would not have continued in that position, but I did regard myself as an advocate.

I spoke for it as an advocate. 

Senator, I was asked the same question yesterday by another Senator and I told him that 1 felt having been an advocate for the Department in the matter and being presently in the position of a nominee, it would be inappropriate for me to answer that question.If 1 might add this observation, having headed for a while last year the Justice Department's program of campus visitations and on one of which I had the pleasure of going to the University of Hawaii, 1 could not help but realize from talking to some of the student audiences that there was a very real fear in this area.You made the comment, ''whether based on fact or fancy." My impression from what 1 know about the facts and figures of the Federal Government's wiretapping activities is that it is not based on fact, but as you point out, whether it is based on fact or fancy, it can nevertheless have a chilling effect on one's feeling of freedom to communicate through the telephone and other such means.And my own hope would be that by a campaign of bringing the facts to the attention of the citizenry, of the actually extraordinarily limited use of these mechanisms by the Government, that some of the fear based not on what is actually done but on third and fourth hand accounts of what is done could be put to rest.I regret that I feel it inappropriate to answer your primary question. 

Senator, that very issue has been decided in two separate district courts and 1 woidd assume is probably on its way through the courts of appeal and ultimately to the Supreme Court. I just do not think it would be appropriate for me to answer. 

AS I suggested 3'esterday in response to a question, having personally participated in an advisory capacity in the preparation of the Government's brief in the national security wiretapping case, and applying the standards laid down in the memorandum prepared for Mr. Justice White when he went on the Court, I would thinkwithout obviously positively committing myself that I would probably be required to disqualify myself in that case.Insofar as simply having generally advocated before students, student audiences, or otherwise defended the Government's use of the authority given it by Congress, I believe that I could divorce mj- role as an advocate from what it would be as a Justice of the Supreme Court should I be confirmed.

There certainly is a difference between a search warrant for particular tangible evidence thought to be located in a particular physical location and a court order for a wiretap, albeit limited in time, for the reasons that you state, Senator.

I think it would be inappropriate for me to answer that question, Senator, in view of my role as advocate. I can certainly say that promiscuous wiretapping I would regard as a very dangerous practice.

With the reservations I previously stated, Senator, and with my lack of familiarity with the detailed provisions of the bill which you are describing, I think I must keep my answer general.Certainly any sort of electronic surveillance that would interfere with the lawyer-client relationship of a defendant after he has been charged would be very disturbing.

Senator, I have had, I think, one grand jury in my life and I am not intimately familiar with the practices or procedures governing grand juries. I would be hesitant to express a view simply from lack of knowledge on that point. My impression from the situation which you describe is that at least in some cases the witness would be adequately protected by the invocation of the fifth amendment. However, I can imagine it being used in a harassing manner also. 

Oh, I certainly do not think any witness should be tricked by the Government. If your question goes further than that, I would have to almost say I would want to see the particular facts. 

My first comment would be I can defend rrryself from my enemies but save me from my friends. [Laughter.]I think that that is not a fair characterization even of vaj philosophical views. M}^ hope would be if I were confirmed to divorce as much as possible whatever my own preferences, perhaps, as a legislator or as a private citizen would be as to how a particular question should be resolved and address myself simply to what I understand the Constitution and the laws enacted b}T Congress to require.

Yes, I do.

Recalling as best I can from Mr. Wiener's book, which I believe is the source of my knowledge on the subject, it is the situation where the force brought to bear against the law enforcement forces is such that the normal procedure of individual arrest and booking and admission to bail and appearance before a community magistrate simply cannot be carried out and in this situation it is my understanding that the courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Moyer v. Peabody, have said it was lawful for the Government in that situation to resort to a situation of arrest not on the basis of criminal charge of individual wrongdoing but on a very temporary basis of simply restoring order, and that the process was not arrest in the normal sense and that release was required in a very short order as soon as the serious emergency had passed.That is a short summary of my understanding of it, Senator. 

AS I said yesterday in response to another question, Senator Mathias, with respect to the public accommodations ordinance, I think my views have changed.With respect to the 1967 letter which I wrote in the context of the Phoenix school system as it then existed, I think I still am of the view that busing or transportation over long distances of students for the purpose of achieving a racial balance where you do not have a dual school system is not desirable.

I would hope none. I realize that that is the same question I would Avant to be asking a nominee if I were a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I cast about for some way of perhaps giving some objective evidence of the fact, rather than simply asking }Tou to rely on my assurance.I was on several occasions in Phoenix chosen to be an arbitrator between lawyers who found themselves in dispute with respect to particular claims, and I think the reason I was chosen was because there was a feeling that I would be fair, that whatever I might feel about personalities involved or about personal doctrine, I would try to apply whatever law there was to the facts and reach a fair conclusion.I have ahvays felt that, as I think Justice Frankfurter said, you inevitably take yourself and your background with you to the Court. There is no way you can avoid it, but J think it Avas Frankfurter who also said, if putting on the robe does not change a man, there is something AATong AATith the man. I subscribe unresenredly to that philosophy, that Avhen you put on the robe, 3-011 are not there to enforce your oAvn notions as to AArhat is desirable public policy. You are there to construe as objectively as 3rou possibhj can the Constitution of the United States, the statutes of Congress, and AA^hatever relevant legal materials there may be in the case before you.

It is so difficult to pin down the terms "liberal" and "conser\-ative," and I suspect they may mean something different Avhen one is talking about a political alinement as opposed to a judicial philosophy on the Supreme Court.I think it would be presumptuous of me to suggest to the Senators on this committee, or to the Senate as a Avhole, AA'hat standards they ought to look for, but I cannot think of a better one than fidelity to the Constitution and let the chips fall Avhere they may, so to speak, whether the particular decision pleases one group or pleases another.I think to an extent in discussion about the Court there has been a tendency to equate conservatism of judicial philosophy not with a conservative political bias, but with a tendency to want to assure one's self that the Constitution does indeed require a particular result before saying so, and to equate liberalism with a feeling that at least on the part of the person making the observation that the person tends to read his own views into the Constitution.I think the difference is well illustrated by Justice Frankfurter's career, who came on the Court at a time when I think it was clear to most observers that the old Court of the nine old men of the twenties and thirties was indeed, on any objective analysis, reading its own views into the Constitution, and Justice Frankfurter, of course, prior to his ascent to the bench, had been critical of this, and as a Justice he helped demolish the notion that there was some sort of freedom of contract written into the Constitution which protected businessmen from economic regulation.And yet, when other doctrines were tested later in the Court, it proved that he was not simply an exponent of the current politically liberal ideology and reading that into the Constitution.He was careful to try to read neither the doctrine of the preceding Court nor perhaps his own personal views at a later time to the Constitution, but to simply read it as he saw it.

Senator, I honestly think that is too specific a question for me to answer. I know there are several cases pending up there now and I would anticipate that there would be a number in the future.

I do not believe I ought to, Senator. 

I just think it would be inappropriate for me to try to now advance some sort of definition of a term which may well, if I were confirmed, come before me and on which I would hear argument and read briefs and have the benefit of discussion in the conference room.

NO. I do not think it really does distort it. I think what was meant was that the guarantees of the first amendment do not mean that everybody is going to be provided with a printing press in order that they can have their own newspapers, but instead that anyone who has a newspaper is going to be permitted to say whatever he thinks. 

Well, I would say that the series of freedom of contract cases, Lochner v. New York, Adkins v. Children's Hospital, by the objective judgment of historians, represented an intrusion of personal political philosophy into constitutional doctrine which the framers had never intended, and that Frankfurter had criticized that from the outside of the Court. It was not entirely clear until he hadbeen on the Bench whether the basis for his criticism was that he did not want laws like that held unconstitutional or whether it was that he felt there wTas no constitutional warrant for invalidating them, and I suppose you never know about an advocate until he does get on the Bench because it is only then that he is put to the test.But the test came for him, I suspect, not so much in those cases but in other cases which later came before the Court, where he had great personal reservations, I suspect, about what was being done but, nevertheless, felt that the Constitution did not prevent it.

Could you spell out the question a little more? 

Well, trying to keep it in the terms of historical analysis rather than my own estimate of how I would decide something, I think Justice Frankfurter's behavior while he was a member of the Warren court is some indication at least of his agreement with them in some areas and disagreement in others. He joined the unanimous decision in the school desegregation cases. He dissented from some of the cases involving the rights of criminal defendants. 

Well, it is much easier to make a historical judgment with at least a degree of confidence about decisions that were handed down over a period of years from 1905 to 1935 than it is with respect to a Court whose decisions are handed down from a period of 1953 until 2 years ago, if that is what you mean by the Warren Court, and therefore I think there is a great deal of difference in the confidence with which one can say history, in the sense of legal historians objectively evaluating it, has said that the so-called nine old men were wrong, at least a majority of them were wrong, in reading in freedom of contract. I do not claim to be a keen student of legal historians analyzing the Warren Court. I would think that in the area of the Warren Court's criminal law decisions there probably is not the same consensus as to legal historians at the present time. 

Well, wThat I am giving you is my understanding of a historical consensus, and

Yes, on the freedom of contract doctrine I think I would agree. I think the historical consensus, because of the recency of the Warren Court's decision, is less firm, partly for that reason. I think there is substantial historical consensus in accord with the Brown versus Board of Education decision. I think that in the criminal law area, it is my understanding that there simply is not that sort of consensus. Whether it is from lack of time to develop or from disagreement 

Well, I certainly would not set myself up to make some sort of sweeping generalization about the Warren Court which sat from 1953 to 1969. 

I was prepared to do it in the sense of a very specific doctrine that was enunciated over a period of years from about 1905 to 1935. 

Certainly the Warren Court was known for those types of cases; yes. 

I have given you my evaluation in terms of my understanding of a historical consensus. I wrote publicly on two cases decided by the Warren Court in 1957 or 1958. That was on the basis of making a reasonably careful study of the cases and the precedents and coming to a conclusion. I certainly would not attempt to categorize all streams of cases without having had some opportunity to research the precedents, even from a historical point of view. 

NO. I am not prepared to say that.

That is substantially correct, yes. 

NO I am still here. 

1 do not think that is an entirely fair statement. 

I know we have. I think it would be inappropriate in an area where I have acted as an advocate to express a personal view. I realize that leaves you in an unsatisfied position, but I do not feel I can do otherwise. 

I am simply not able to. 

I testified before the House Judiciary Committee. 

Yes.

I think I must refrain from answering. 

Well, I think that, if I may speak with extreme generality as I feel is required, that 

Certainly the equal protection of the laws clause in the 14th amendment protexts women just as it protects other discrete minorities, if one could call women a minority. 

NO. I think the Court has been quite unwilling—in tliat Michigan bartender case decided about 1940 or 1949, they held that a limitation on a right of women to tend bar, as I recall, which was a fairly stringent limitation, nonetheless was not a violation of the equal protection clause, and it seems to me that there is one other case which I do not recall in which they also held something claimed to be a violation of equal protection clause was not one.

I think that is one of the issues in one of the cases that is up there now.

Yes.

I think it is not appropriate for me to get any more specific. To say whether I agree with the doctrine of a particular case or not I think would be entirely inappropriate for a nominee. 

YOU mean as a matter—do I think it philosophically sound in accordance with my own personal notions? 

Well, I will certainly try to answer that, with the understanding that this is not the same thing as saying that the Constitution so provides. 

Yes.

That was the view I took in the testimony I presented to Senator Ervin's committee on behalf of the Justice Department. 

My personal view as to whether something that may be bad government policy is nonetheless not unconstitutional?

I think that calls for a judgment on the very specific factual situation.

I think that calls for a constitutional judgment on the very specific sets of facts and I do not think I ought to give it.

None at all, Senator Bayh. 

I think that there are some paragraphs in my Houston law day speech which recognize the great importance of recognition of minority rights, that the progress is not as fast as we would like and that more remains to be done. I am trying to think of some other public statement that may contain similar—well, you know, I am just going back through isolated passages in public statements.

Well, I am trying to think through, perhaps going backward from the public remarks I have made in the Justice Department. I think in my so-called New Barbarians speech I made the statement that the people who lie on railroad tracks to prevent the carrying out of the laws stand on exactly the same footing as a Southern Governor who stands in the schoolhouse door.Now, this may not indicate anything more than a statement on my part but it certainly indicated that I have, long before my nomination to the Supreme Court was made, felt strongly that the law of the land should be carried out in every part of the country and that resistance to it, whether in the name of interposition or something else in the South, or whether in the name of consciencious objection somewhere else, couldn't be tolerated.

Justice Miller, I think, made the statement in the slaughterhouse cases that in his opinion the principal import of the post-Civil War amendments was to benefit the Negro race.I have always felt that was contemporaneous construction and a sound one of those amendments.

I think I would justify it in this manner: that presumably the nine Justices sitting on the Court at the time that Brown versus Board of Education came before them canvassed, indeed they canvassed to such an extent that they set the case down for reargument on specific issues, deeply canvassed the historical intent of the 14th amendment's framers, the debates on the floors of Congress, and concluded that the Court in Plessy against Ferguson had not correctly interpreted that. Now, that seems to me a very proper role of the Court. Precedent is not sacrosanct in that sense. Due weight has to be given to the Justices of an earlier day who gave their conscientious interpretation, but if a recanvass of the historical intent of the framers indicates that that earlier Court was wrong, then the subsequent Court has no choice but to overrule the earlier decisions. 

Of course, I do not support lawmaking as a Supreme Court judge; but as I stated yesterday, if nine Justices, presumably of the same varying temperaments that one customarily gets on the Supreme Court at the same time, all address themselves to the issue and all unanimously decide that the Constitution requires a particular result, that, to me, is very strong evidence that the Constitution does, in fact, require that result. But that is not lawmaking. It is interpretation of the Constitution just as was contemplated by John Marshall in Marbury versus Madison. 

Count the number of votes where?

IS the thrust of your question the idea that I was suggesting that unless all nine of them agree, none of them should have voted to overrule Plessy versus Ferguson! m 

Well, I don't think you would ever say that a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court is irrelevant in determining a case before }Tou as a Justice of the Supreme Court. I think one would approach a unanimous decision, particularly one that has been reexamined and reaffirmed, with the greatest deference. That doesn't say you never decide otherwise.

Well, an examination into the intent of the framers of the 14th amendment. If you became convinced that the Plessy Court had not properly interpreted that intent, that it had simply adopted a view that was too narrow to be consistent with what the framers of the 14th amendment intended, then I think you would be entitled to disregard Plessy.Again, an 8-to-l decision is not one lightly to be disregarded, but nonetheless, if upon reexamination giving the weight that you ought to give to a precedent it appears wrong, then it is wrong.

Well, I suppose one is entitled to take into account the fact that public education in 1954 is a much more significant institution in our society than it was in 1896. That is not to say thatthat means that the framers of the 14th amendment may have meant one thing but now we change that, but just that the rather broad language they used now has a somewhat different application because of new development in our society.

I have felt obligated to respond with my personal views on busing because of the letter which I wrote and I have done so with a good deal of reluctance because of the fact that obviously busing has been and is still a question of constitutional dimension in view of some of the Supreme Court decisions, and I am loath to expand on what I have previously said.My personal opinion is that I remain of the same view as to busing over long distances. The idea of transporting people by bus in the interest of quality education is certainly something I would feel I would want to consider all the factors involved in. I think that is a legislative, or at least a local school board type of decision.

Well, there is no doubt of that. 

I am not sure that I know that much about the various schools in Phoenix at the time to answer that. 

Well, I will stand on my earlier statement that the busing over long distances to achieve racial balance which many might think also contributed to quality education was a burden that the schools in Phoenix as they existed at that time should not have to bear. 

Oh, certainly. 

Senator, I think that goes beyond the bounds of simply my present view as to the comments I made in 1957 and since it is so obviously something that could come before the Supreme Court, I don't think I ought to answer it.

I think I will stand on my earlier statement. 

I have to assume it is a hypothetical question, although some elements have certainly been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local courts here. I think some of them are assumptions. But speaking to it as a combined factual and nypothetical question, I did not make any effort to intervene in the matter after the turmoil for two reasons, I suspect: One is that the Office of Legal Counsel is basically an advisory branch of the Justice Department. The operational divisions—the criminal division, civil rights division, internal security division—are the people who handle things in the courts and in this case, as a matter of fact, I think it was the District of Columbia Corporation Counsel and the U.S. attorneys who were handling it. The second thing is that, as I recall, my last day in the office before I was down with this back trouble was sometime around May 8 or 9, and I was simply incapacitated from that time until early June. 

I think that it is a generally applicable principle in the lawyer-client relationship that the lawyer does not express his personal view as to the merits of the client's case. I think that that has added applicability here because the effect, assuming that there were some areas in which I disagreed with the position I have publicly taken for my clients would be disadvantageous to them. For that reason I certainly don't feel I can simply answer in areas where I may be in agreement and say "No comment" where I am in disagreement, since the obvious implication would be that where I say "No comment" I am in disagreement; and I think this is less than fateful advocacy on the part of a lawyer toward his client.Now, I realize that this puts the committee in something of a dilemma. I don't know that it is much different than that posed by the position of other nominees who have come here, but at any rate I am simply unwilling now, even though I may be a Supreme Court nominee, to foresake what I conceive to be my obligation to my clients.69-267—71 12

Both are certainly involved in many of the cases. 

My clients are the Attorney General and the President. 

Well 

NO. That, Senator, I regard as a great oversimplification. Certainly as to the President, if one conceives him to be a client and have a law3Ter which I don't think is the happiest expression of that relationship, he is, for all practical purposes, a popularly elected executive who is responsible to the Nation as a whole every 4 3Tears for an electoral mandate. The Attorney General is the President's appointee. He is responsible to the President. I am the President's appointee to a position where I am responsible both to the Attorney General and to the President. 

Certainly the President is the closest thing in a Republican form of government that may be typified as representing the people. 

Certainly, the client is entitled to waive the privilege. The lawyer is not.

Well, I think to the extent that the Department, the administration, takes a public position, 1 feel free to discuss and have discussed my own personal contribution to that position—the New York Times case being an example; the preparation of the national security wiretapping brief being another example. But insofar as I may have been asked for advice in the process of making administration policy decisions upon which the administration has not taken a public position, there, I think, the lawyer-client privilege very definitely obtains.Where the administration has taken a public position and the lawyer is asked not what advice did you give in connection with that position but basically do you personally agree with the position or not, there, 1 tlrink, it is inappropriate to answer even though a public position has been taken.

Yes; I do.

1 would think that it could be; yes. 

I would certainly think the privilege could be waived by the clients. Now, just who the client is, whether it is the President or the Attorney General, is something that would depend on the particular circumstances.

I agree on that. 

Without suggesting at all my own impressions as to what a response would be, I would certainly have no objection to your sending

I believe it is, Senator. 

It is not that I have any hesitancy in answering the question, except as to the propriety of repeating any discussion with the President. Since there was none here, I suppose I need have no hesitancy; no, he did not. 

Certainly those sources were available to him. 

NO; I don't believe they would. 

Certainly past nominations have generally taken that position, and I think their refusals to answer that sort of question were probably justified.

Senator, could I get up and walk around the table once? 

Put in context, Senator, I do. The last sentence that you quoted was, as I am sure is apparent to you, a prediction on my part of what I thought the Court would do. That does not represent my own personal opinion. But put in the context of surveillance, not in the sense of wiretapping or invasion of premises or in terms of trying to use Government sanctions to extract information from people, but simply the observation of someone in a public place and qualified by the possibility that the result would be different where actual harrassment were shown, as I commented yesterday, my answer to your question is yes. 

That was my testimony at that time. I think that I am entitled to have borne in mind the fact that I was then a Justice Department spokesman, and that the Justice Department as a possible litigant in such action, is certainly required to take a reasonable position, but it is not required to take the one which would be most restrictive on its activities. 

I didn't mean to say precisely that, Senator. I said that if I felt what I was saying was reprehensible or obnoxious to me, I would not be in the position I am in now. I would take that to leave open disagreements within what I consider to be reasonable bounds.

Would you read that back again? 

I am not sure I do agree with that now. I am inclined to think that it is a fact question and I was perhaps resolving the fact question in my own mind on the basis of the line of inquiry that Senator Hart made yesterday, where thousands of people came, knowing there was going to be such surveillance, on the basis of Judge Austin's decision in Chicago, where he found as a fact that there was no stifling effect.I do not think I would want to categorically say that such surveillance could not have a stifling effect. I think I would treat it as a question of fact.

The question being whether surveillance 

Again, assuming that in fact the surveillance efforts have no chilling effect, I would stand by that answer, I think, again as a spokesman for the Department. 

In the absence of a causative connection between some sort of chilling effect and the surveillance itself, that was the position I took for the Department, and I believe it would be a reasonable one. 

Well, I don't think the question was phrased that way.

Given the factual assumption of a chilling effect, then I would want to reserve judgment. 

Yes, sir; as in a Chicago type of case, I do. 

That is the type of fact situation I would want to know before attempting to answer yes or no on the existence of a chilling effect. 

Subject to the qualification I gave to my previous answer to your question, I would stand by that statement. 

NO ; I am not talking about the sense of redemption of the individual lawbreaker, although certainly I realize the word "atonement" can be used in that sense. I am thinking more of the idea which I also expressed in the same speech, that he who strikes at a law, strikes at the law, and that every time a law is violated there is a risk of a snowballing effect. Thus, individual sentences under the law, while all that are appropriate for the individual violator, may not be able to redress the necessary respect for law on the part of society as a whole. 

NO; not in the sense that he shouldn't be restored .to whatever civil rights and freedom the law authorizes in that situa-69-267—71 13tion. All I meant was that a deliberate lawbreaker strikes a blow at the system, as well as committing a personal violation of the law.

What I meant wTas that what has been occasionally characterized as nonviolent disobedience, lying down on railroad tacks in front of troop trains, and that sort of thing, to prevent the ordinary functions of government to be carried out, simply because it is not itself violent, is not therefore justifiable.

Justice Holmes made the remark in a case he decided when he was a judge of the supreme judicial court of Massachusetts, that a man may have a right to free speech, but he has no right to be a policeman. He in effect held that whatever locality it was in Massachusetts had a perfect right to dismiss a policeman for exercising free speech because it wasn't violating the freedom of speech provisions.I think the courts have since taken a broader view of the free speech provision and felt, quite properly, that the sanction of dismissal was itself an infringement on free speech, could be tolerated in some situations and not others, and I think the great view of history today is that Justice Holmes was mistaken in making that assertion.

Yes, sir; I do.

Yes, sir, Senator. Senator Mathias asked me a somewhat similar question this morning, and I think I said in reply to him that the first amendment did not require that the Government equip everybody with a printing press or give them each a television station. It meant simply that those who had printing presses and those who had television stations should be able to say whatever thev wanted to.

Not at all, and your statement is perhaps a better statement than I made on what the fact is, that the man with the television station has a better chance to express his views than the man who doesn't have it, but each has free speech within his own compass.

Well, putting aside any conceivable constitutional implications or statutory interpretations, I think it is a highly desirable result.I was on the Board of Maricopa County Legal Aid Society at a time when funds were difficult to come by, and the services provided to the poor simply weren't adequate because of lack of funding. I think that the increased funding is now making legal services available to the poor as well as to the rich, and I heartily favor that.

I haven't changed my mind that the Senate ought to be interested in a nominee's views. I have come to have an increasing sympathy for the problem of the nominee to respond to very legitimate questions from the Senators without in some way giving the appearance of prejudging issues that might come before him. Certainly in the sense of formulating a definition of due process, when one thinks of all of the cases that have been decided under that clause, it strikes me as virtually impossible. One can advert to settled doctrines of due process, that a confession obtained by coercion is a violation of the due process of law. That doctrine strikes me as being so well settled a nominee need have no reservation about saying that that is a classical example of it. The idea that a man is entitled to a hearing before he is deprived of substantial rights is another doctrine that strikes me as so wTell settled one need have no hesitancy in saying that.There are much closer questions of due process, I am sure, pending now in the courts that I ought not to express a view on.

Well, I would first, as is obvious, read the amendment, and you suggest that there are no precedents, yet certainly there would be cases that would be not too far off and I would be inclined to go back to the debates, the Bingham explanation of what he meant by the 14th amendment, other explanations on the floor, and I am sure you would come up with something that obviously would not have included a particular discussion of whether a trial could be televised or not.All I can think of doing is by the very best and most faithful type of analysis to see if this sort of thing was within the broad prescription that the framers and ratifiors of that amendment had in mind.

NO; I don't believe I would unless I found that to be one of the components of the due process clause.I don't think it would be right for me to simply say, this doesn't seem fair to me, therefore, I am going to find it is a violation of due process.

TO the extent that fairness is a component of due process, as a part of the debates and intent of the framers, certainly that would be taken into consideration.I think it would be wrong for me to simply read in my own subjective notions of fairness.

NO; certainly the fact that the framers of the due process clause did not contemplate specifically that trials might be televised does not foreclose the issue under the due process clauses.

Fairness in the context of the due process clause. 

I can tell you the general thought that was in my mind at that time, Senator. I am relying on recollection, and my recollection may be incorrect, as to cases or situations, but I think perhaps the thought will come across.As I recall, in the case of Mapp v. Ohio, there was a breaking1 into a house under the most objectionable sort of circumstances, without any warrant, and a simple ransacking search of the whole place. That would strike me as the kind of violation I was referring to in the second context.The technical violation I would put in terms of this case from Wyoming that came up to the Supreme Court last spring, where the sheriff in one of the Wyoming counties, on a tip from an informer, went before a magistrate to get a search warrant, rather than an arrest warrant, for two robbery defendants who were later apprehended in another part of Wyoming as a result of a statewide radio broadcast, and after the Supreme Court of Wyoming had ruled against the claim, and the district court in Wyoming and in the tenth circuit ruled against the habeas corpus eliam, the Supreme Court of the United States ultimately held that the search warrant was improperly issued because the information presented to the magistrate didn't meet the tests that it ought to meet for a search warrant.I think that was the type of thing that I had in mind when I said a technical violation.

AS far as the action of the Government agent is concerned, it is the absolute test there too. What I was referring to was not that the Government agents who may have committed a violation of law, however technical, be treated differently than some private citizen, but whether it was desirable, as a matter of policy, to apply the exclusionary rule which in effect excludes the evidence not as against the technical violator of the law, but against the person who was concededly guilty other than for the absence of the evidence to be excluded.

I think John Marshall. 

He made the Supreme Court what it is today more than any other person. I think it was Senator Fong who was commenting this morning that there are lots of countries with constitutions that have very fine charters of individual liberties and restraints on Government power, but somehow people get arrested all the time, and things just don't work out the way the constitution said they would. I think it is largely the responsibility of John Marshall and his establishment of the doctrine of judicial review which has made our Constitution a living document. 

I believe that position was taken, Senator Mathias, in the district court. I am not sure whether it was taken in the court of appeals or not.In the brief in the Supreme Court, the Government does not take the position that there is some sort of inherent power in the Executive which makes it superior to the fourth amendment. The position the Government has taken is that the executive, like every other branch of the Government, is bound by the unreasonable search and seizure restrictions of the fourth amendment, and that the question is whether this particular overhearing was or was not an unreasonable search and seizure.

Since I have described my participation in the brief, I feel I can say what my own contribution was and not any other opposing views. I felt it was a mistake for the Government to take the position that there was inherent power, and that the case could best be put forward both from the point of view of the Government in its more limited interests as an adversary and in the interests of the Government in the larger point of view by framing the case in terms of whether it was an unreasonable search and seizure under the fourth amendment, rather than some over-riding inherent power.

YOU are referring now, Senator, to the national security wiretapping, or the wiretapping under the Omnibus Crime

Under the Omnibus Crime Act, without attempting to prejudge or express an opinion on any particular case, I would think that the competing factors to be weighed are the closeness of the analogy between the traditional warrant procedure for searching premises for tangible physical evidence and the court order authorized under the Omnibus Crime Act for intercepting a conversation for a limited period of time. And basically the competing interest between the right of the individual to privacy in his conversations, privacy in his home, as opposed to the necessity or the authority of the Government in circumscribing circumstances where prior court authorization has been obtained and reasonable cause is shown to believe that incriminating evidence will be obtained for the Government to obtain that evidence. 

Well, there, of course, since the procedure is undertaken without a court authorization in advance, the question iswhether the exercise of the authority by the Attorney General and the President's designate offers a reasonably close approximation of the type of control that you get from presenting the matter to a neutral magistrate, or whether in view of the exigencies of that particular type of case, some lesser degree of neutral control can be accepted in the interest of preventing possible damage to the national security.

The position that the Department ultimately took was that it would not oppose mandatory dismissals as such if the bill were coupled with some reform in the practice of Federal habeas corpus, and were also designed to allow the system to reasonably adjust to these new time limitations in order that there wouldn't be a sudden wave of dismissals because of the inability of the system to shift to the new time schedule.

NO, it wasn't, Senator, and since one of our leading newspapers in the Nation's Capital lias presented an account from somewhere of what happened, I feel at liberty of speaking about it without the circumspection I might otherwise feel. Several of us in the Department have been working on the program. Although I was not immediately responsible for it, I was one of those who discussed it, and I think all of us unanimously felt that the mandatory dismissals imposed on the prosecution by the bill, without any concomitant sanctions imposed on the defense, was an unfairway, so far as the prosecution was concerned, of implementing the speedy trial requirement. I had occasion to be aut on the road, so to speak, and be giving a speech down at Maxwell Field, and in the discussion there it became apparent to me that a number of people who were by no means softies, if one may use that oversimplified term in the area of law enforcement,, were nonetheless concerned about the situation, where people simply languished in jail because they were unable to raise bond and weren't brought to trial within a short period of time. 

I suspect there is a good deal of truth to that. At any rate, I became convinced, after hearing this discussion, that the Department ought to shift its position and not just the criminal defendant's situation would be improved, but that the whole system of criminal justice would be improved if we somehow got a guarantee of reasonably speedy administration of criminal justice primarily at the trial level but other places elseAvhere, and that the values to be gained from such improvement clearly outweighed the probabilitythat there would be some mandatory dismissals of people who were guilty and simply weren't able to be tried in that time.

Yes sir.

If you will forgive me for being general, I will certainly try.

Well, certainly one factor is the strong public policy in favor of assuring the presence of a defendant at his trial. Once he has been indicted and arraigned.Congress has, in the Bail Reform Act of 1966, provided for a number of other less severe sanctions than the actual requirement of bail, but under the Constitution bail is nonetheless permissible.Whether or not it is excessive, 1 would take it, would depend on whether the amount fixed with an eye to actually assuring the defendant's presence at the trial.I would suppose that bail would quite arguably be excessive if it were fixed with an eye to simply keeping the man in jail rather than an .amount sufficient to reasonably assure his presence at the trial.

Well, of course, in many States my recollection is that capital offenses simply aren't baliable, and I take it the philosophy behind that is that a man who may be convicted of a capital crime has absolvtely no incentive to show up for his trial, and that, therefore, there you do not even run the risk of any sort of bail; but I think going down the scale of graduation of offenses, certainty the lighter the offense, the smaller the bail would be, is the customary way one would balance that.

Unless you can prod me with some statement of fact, I am not sure anything comes to mind as due process under the fifth amendment.

Yes, no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. I suppose that means at the very least a person to be deprived of his liberty is entitled to a hearing before a fairty constituted tribunal, to be apprised of the charges against him, to have an opportunity to present witnesses on his behalf, to have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses—again assuming this is a full-fledged criminal trial.I think if I got more particular than that I would be roaming into areas where I probably ought not to.

Well, I think the Court has held that the general rule is that a search without a warrant is unreasonable and that ordinarily in order to search, there must be a warrant issued by a neutral magistrate upon a showing of probable cause.On the other hand, there are recognized exceptions to that doctrine, as the doctrine of exigent circumstances set forth in Kerr against California.I think the classic example is that of the automobile which is very likely to be moved hj the time that the police could go and apply to a magistrate for a search warrant. There I believe the courts have said that because of that necessity, a warrant is not required, and I think that is the sort of balance the courts have tried to strike; that where a warrant is obtainable, the general rule is that a warrant is required, that it is up to the Government to justify those exceptional situations in which a warrant is not required.

AS general propositions, I have no quarrel with those at all. 

It will. 

Yes, I would very much, Mr. Chairman. My wife of 33 years, Nan. My daughter, Janet. My son-in-law, Joe Lynch.

Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is a great honor to have an opportunity to appear before this committee today. I am deeply grateful to the President for the confidence he manifested in me when he nominated me to be Chief Justice of the United States, and I welcome the opportunity these hearings afford the committee and the Senate to discharge their constitutional duty in the appointment process.I want to thank Senator Dole, Senator DeConcini, Senator Warner, and Senator Trible for spending the time and effort necessary to introduce me to the Committee.I am at the committee's disposal, Mr. Chairman. 

NO, Mr. Chairman. I understand the questioning is reserved for tomorrow. 

Thank you, Senator Metzenbaum. Let me amend my statement to thank Senator Goldwater. 

IS it my understanding that I may be excused, Mr. Chairman? 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. 

Yes, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I think that the Chief Justice can exercise a certain amount of leadership on the Court, but I do not think it is apt to be in a philosophical direction.130 Several of the cases this morning that were mentioned—Brown v. The Board ofEducation, the Nixon tapes case—were those kind of rare great cases where I think the Court develops a consensus that the opinion ought to be written by the Chief Justice, and there is a real institutional feeling that it ought to be unanimous, if possible. You take another case like the steel seizure case, which was an equally important case, and there the Chief Justice was in a minority of three. The only way for him to have led the Court there would have been to change his own vote and make it 7 to 2. I do not think that is leadership to simply say that since you are outvoted you will change your mind. I think the Chief Justice does have a couple prerogatives, again, that have been mentioned: the authority to lead the conference discussion and the authority to assign cases. And I think both of these, properly exercised, can lead to a smoothly functioning Court. But the idea that the power to lead the conference discussion to start off and be the first one to discuss means that the Chief Justice can pull the wool over other people's eyes by his discussion and make them think that green is blue, my 15 years on the Court convinces me that is not the case. The same with the assignment power. The Chief Justice, by properly exercising the assignment power, can pick out the strengths and weaknesses of his colleagues, play on the strengths, avoid the weaknesses, and again, work toward a smoothly functioning Court. But if the Chief Justice assigns the case to someone who feels very much the way he does about it, but not like the majority of the Court feels about it, the person to whom the case is assigned is not going to be able to get a Court opinion. So I think the Chief Justice does have a leadership role, Mr. Chairman, but I do not think it has much to do with the philosophical direction of the Court. 

In the absence of any more careful description of the allegations, I think I would say, Mr. Chairman, that I have reread very carefully the statement I made to the committee in 1971 and have absolutely no reason to doubt its correctness now. 

I would be happy to, Mr. Chairman. I think we do need an intercircuit panel of some sort, and I so stated publicly, as has the Chief Justice. Different reasons have been assigned for it. There are nuances of differences, as I understand it, as to how the panel would be made up. But I think the basic problem is this: That for the last 50 years, the Supreme Court has never heard more than about 150 or 160 cases a year on the merits, as opposed to just denying certiorari. And I do not think any careful student of the Court thinks that the Court ought to try to hear more than 150 cases a year.So that in this country right now, we have a nationwide decisionmaking capacity for questions involving Federal statutory law and constitutional law of 150 cases a year. Now, that just is not a large enough nationwide decisionmaking capacity, in my view, to accommodate the need to resolve conflicts among the circuits on statutory questions and to decide Jebatable, novel, constitutional questions.Again, 50 years ago, the Court had roughly 800 petitions for certiorari which gives you some rough idea of how many cases the Federal courts of appeals and the State supreme courts were turning out.Today, we have somewhere around 4,500 petitions for certiorari, an increase of almost sixfold, and yet the nationwide decisionmaking capacity is exactly what it was 50 years ago. I think we very badly need to increase that nationwide decisionmaking capacity by creating some version of the intercircuit tribunal to which your question refers, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Chairman, I think Congress is probably the ultimate decider as to what the proper relationship between State and Federal law is in most situations. Our Court has adopted various preemption doctrines which allow it to interpret whether or not in a given set of circumstances Federal law, which does not say so in so many words, nonetheless preempts State law. And I joined in a number of opinions to that effect, and it strikes me as a sound exposition of the doctrine.But how much is going to be Federal law in any area in which the Congress power reaches and how much is going to be State law, really in the last analysis, depends upon Congress.

Mr. Chairman, I will certainly do the best I can within the limits of the constraints which I feel are on me.As a sitting Justice of the Court, I may certainly refer to cases and perhaps try to describe them from memory, and I feel I can also perhaps, where I am informed, speak in fairly general terms. But I could not, of course, express any view on a question that might come before the Court or I could not attempt to say, well, you know, this case that was decided in 1980 will soon be interpreted, or maybe later be interpreted to mean such and such.This may seem an overly simplistic answer to your question, but it is the kind of question that has to be answered either very shortly or ad infinitum because there are so many nuances.I think a judge has the obligation, when sitting in a Federal system like ours under a written Constitution, to attempt to use every bit of information and every method he can in order to find out what the Constitution means.Certainly a large part of this is the written word that the framers used, not the undisclosed intentions of the framers, but the words that they used.Other useful things are the previous decisions of the Court which have always represented a decision by nine people—or at least nine since some time in the 1830's—who have taken the same oath of office that the then-sitting Justice had, and who presumably have done their best to figure out what it means.And I think that is as good a short answer as I can give you. 

I will certainly venture my opinion, Mr. Chairman, although I have not done the research that I would like to do in order to make a more careful answer. I think the biggest thing about the caseload of the Supreme Court in 1950 and the caseload today is the vast increase in the number of decisions involving constitutional questions. The principle followed by the Court following Justice Brandeis' opinion, I be-lieve, in either the Ashwander or the Burnett case, is that stare decisis is a very fine rule of law, and it should virtually be unanimously adhered to when you are talking about construing a statute. But when you are talking about construing a provision of the Constitution where Congress cannot come back and change it if it feels the Court has made a mistake, then there is more latitude for overruling precedent.I think that probably the reason there have been so many more overrulings since 1950 is that a much larger percentage of the Court's docket has involved constitutional cases.

Again, Mr. Chairman, I am on somewhat difficult grounds, because I think I can describe the holdings of the cases which you describe, and of course, I will be describing them from memory, and I should state very emphatically that it is the opinion of the Court in those cases that speaks authoritatively. My synopsis from memory may well have some errors in it.But I also realize that you cannot at an oral hearing such as this simply point to a volume of the U.S. Reports and tell someone to go look at it.So, in Stone against Powell, the Court held that 

Surely. I am sorry, Mr. Chairman. When a fourth amendment claim had been fully decided against a criminal defendant in the State court system, that the same claim could not be renewed on Federal habeas corpus in an effort to have the State court decision set aside because of a violation of the exclusionary rule. United States against Leon and Massachusetts against Shepard held—and I think it was only in the case of a warrant—that if there was a good-faith mistake on the part of the officer seeking the warrant and his conduct was objectively reasonable, although it turned out it was mistaken, that the exclusionary rule would not be applied in those cases. 

Mr. Chairman, again, I will certainly venture an answer without having had the opportunity to look into it the way I might like to if I were to give a more comprehensive answer.The staple of the Court's work in the 19th century was basically common law. Most of the cases were in the Federal system by reason of diversity of citizenship, and the principles were what were called general principles of common law. There were very few statutes involved.That was in the days when being learned in the law had a very definite connotation. When you said a judge was learned in the law, it meant that he knew Story's Commentaries, and various other commentaries which were largely based on the common law. And so there was a good deal of unanimity of opinion in those days. There was not the sort of discussion, debate, and controversy that has come in the 20th century with difficult questions of statutory interpretation and, again, the increasing constitutional docket of the Court, where we deal often with fairly broad, general phrases, disagreements are natural as to their meaning, and as a result, there are going to be divisions that there were not when you were just dealing with the general common law.

The first part of your question, Mr. Chairman, I think was whether the Supreme Court should be covered by the Judicial Conduct Act. There was a good deal of feeling, I think, among the lower court Federal judges that they had some reservations, as you might imagine, about the Judicial Conduct Act, though I think many of them agree that something of that sort may be necessary.But I think with all respect to those judges, that if you are talking about even a judicial council determining that one of nine members of the Supreme Court is unable to serve and avoiding the impeachment requirement of the Constitution, that is something I would want to take a very, very long look at. And I think the way to do that would be to see how the Judicial Conduct Act works when applied to the judges to whom it is now applicable.I think one should take a couple of very close looks before translating that to the Supreme Court.

AS to the first question, Senator Biden, certainly at the time I was a law clerk when Brown was first argued, there was talk about the South possibly shutting down the public school system. I would defer to Judge Bell's judgment, even if it did not coincide with mine, because he is from Georgia, and that is where the decision was going to be operative.And then I would certainly add, yes, unanimity was certainly essential.And as to Justice Douglas and the Chief Justiceship, I think I remember Judge Bell yesterday saying he did not think he would ever have accepted. And I think that is where I would rather leave it.Really, I think if he had accepted it—he was a remarkably able person—if he had accepted it, I think he would have put his hand to it and done a good job. But I just do not think he ever would have accepted it.

Yes. I am not sure I have read the book in full that you mention. I have read a recent biography of Chief Justice Warren which certainly makes the same point, and I do agree.

The question is very difficult to answer, Senator. Certainly, from the point of view of hindsight, realizing the importance of Brown, the importance of unanimity, one would like to say in answer to the question: "Yes, of course I would." And I think I can probably answer the same way, that if I had seen the thing, seen the case the way the Chief Justice did, and the need for unanimity, I certainly would have tried to persuade a last dissenting colleague that it would be better for the country to make it unanimous.

I was not—I think 

I was there when it was argued for Chief Justice Vinson. 

YOU are asking me what I thought of it as a law clerk? 

I do not know that law clerks think in terms of the need for unanimity, but I do not think I saw it as a law clerk as Chief Justice Warren later came to see it. 

I thought that—putting myself back in 1952 as best I can—I thought that Plessey against Ferguson was wrongin saying that when you segregate races by law you are not depriving anybody of equal protection. I also thought that Plessey against Ferguson had been on the books for 69 years, that the same Congress that promulgated the 14th amendment had required segregated schools in the District. I saw factors on both sides, I think.

Did I think that Plessey was wrong? 

When Brown came down? 

NO, I do not think I did, because when the Court went on record saying that, the stare decisis problem was gone. 

I had not come to rest on that, Senator. I thought about it, and perhaps if I had stayed, if the case had been decided in the term I was there and I had seen circulating drafts, I would have come to a firmer conclusion than I now recall coming to. 

I have told you everything I recall about my views then, Senator. 

Yes; that I thought Plessey had been wrongly decided at the time, that it was not a good interpretation of theequal protection clause to say that when you segregate people by race, there is no denial of equal protection.But Plessey had been on the books for 60 years; Congress had never acted, and the same Congress that had promulgated the 14th amendment had required segregation in the District schools.

Senator, I do not think I reached a conclusion. Law clerks do not have to vote.

Yes, they do. 

I just do not think I can put myself in the position of Justice Reed. I think you can certainly say that he performed a service in doing what he did, and yet I do not think you can say that every time, even in a very important case, the Court stands 8 to 1, that you nonetheless ought to alter your view. 

I was 1 of 18 men chosen at that time. 

And I might add, Senator, that things came to a stop so far as working on any drafts, I believe, the year I was there after the oral argument. It was not the kind of a situation where you would have followed the case through, seen the drafts circulate, see the opinion finally come down. 

NO, no, it was not. 

TO a certain extent, Senator, I think I would have to say yes, although I am sure I have been a contributor on occasion, as have all nine of us, to what you refer to as something of a proliferation of individual opinions. One of the previous witnesses—it may have been Mr. Lane— made the statement that when the Court comes up with a plurality opinion, or with a Court opinion in several concurring opinions, it just is not clear to judges in lower courts and perhaps to lawyers exactly what the law is. And that cannot be a plus. There is a great tendency to feel—and I felt it myself, and I have followed the tendency myself, although I must say I try to restrain it lately—that so-and-so who is writing the Court opinion has not said it quite the way I think it should be said, and therefore, I will write this little concurrence; it will not harm anybody. Well, in fact, it does tend to muddy the message a little bit. So I agree with you it is regrettable. 

Senator, the Chief Justice can cajole or urge, as Chief Justice Warren did Justice Reed, but I have a feeling that when you get to the ordinary kind of case that it does not work very often. I think one thing the Chief Justice can surely do is lead by example. That is, if the Chief Justice makes it a practice of not writing separately, except when he feels it is absolutely necessary, I think that then the Chief might have some weight in speaking to someone else and saying, "Look, do you really need to say this?" But if the person spoken to has the feeling it is the pot calling the kettle black, they will not get anywhere.

And you would like me to comment on it? [Laughter.]

I will be happy to comment, Senator. It is rather easy to put together statistics showing A, B, C, or D if you choose the right year. I think certainly the early days of my tenure on the Court, I filed, quote, "lone," closed quote, dissents probably more often than any of my colleagues except Justice Douglas. I think in the past 5 years, the statistics indicate that my colleague Justice Stevens has filed lone dissents more than I have. And I think that is an interesting example, because no one would contend that Justice Stevens is on either the right or the left wing of the Court; he is regarded as a centrist. And yet he has filed more lone dissents than anyone else. Sometimes it is not that you are way over on one side, but you may just disagree with the way the Court has reasoned through a rather fine point. So I think if one were either in lone dissent or in dissent with two or three other people very, very frequently, it probably would have an effect on how you are able to perform as Chief Justice. But the statistics I have just referred to, it seems to me, indicate that I should not have any great problem. That does not mean there will not be an occasional lone dissent. 

I view it as a very important aspect of the role of the Chief Justice, Senator. Chief Justice Burger will be a hard act to follow in that respect, because certainly, no Chief Justice has ever devoted the attention to the sort of things you have just described as he has. But I do not think it is something that ought to be regarded as kind of an idiosyncracy of his, because I think that the lower Federal court judges, State court judges, havereally felt that he was speaking for them on many occasions, calling problems of the profession or of the Judiciary to the attention of Congress or of the profession in the way a highly visible spokesman can, but in a way that a multitude of less visible spokesmen cannot.I think the Chief Justice is going to have to keep on in that role, and I think it is a very important one.

Yes; as I say, the Chiefs act is a hard one to follow, but I would certainly do my best if the Senate confirms me.

I have, Senator Mathias, and I think that is just the way the system should work. The Federal Constitution certainly lays down one rule for all 50 States, and if some States want a more stringent prohibition against searches and seizures than that provided by the fourth amendment, it just makes sense that they ought to have it. If some States are content with the Federal provision, which everybody has to live up to, it seems to me that makes sense for them to have that. I think it is a very healthy development.

Oh, absolutely. 

NO; I do not think the Court is necessarily the final arbiter of the law of the land. It is the final arbiter of the U.S. Constitution and of the meaning of Federal statutes and treaties. But we still live in a somewhat pluralistic society where the States' highest courts are the final arbiters of the meaning of their State constitutions. That is just as it ought to be, I think. 

Speaking generally, Senator, and of course, that is the only way I can speak in response to a question like that, because

Yes; the same type of deference as the Supreme Court gives to decisions of lower Federal courts interpreting the U.S. Constitution. The decision is obviously entitled to weight, but if it does not fully square with precedents from the Supreme Court then it probably, if brought up, should be overturned. 

That was the question I believe you brought up a moment ago, and that is every bit their privilege. But it is when State courts say this conviction should be reversed not because it offends the State constitution, but because the search offended the fourth amendment; that, of course, is a Federal question, and the final authority on Federal questions like that is the Supreme Court of the United States. 

That is kind of a tall order. Let me go immediately to the multiplication of Federal judges. This is a concern which has been voiced by me in the past, by Judge Rubin of the fifth circuit, by Judge Higginbotham of the fifth circuit. It is a very real concern to anyone interested in the Federal judiciary. The Federal judiciary obviously does not pay comparably to what a lawyer with a substantial practice in a good-sized city would make. And so the attractiveness of the job and the ability of the Federal courts to get first-rate lawyers has got to depend on the—prestige sounds somewhat like it is a social thing—but the significance of a Federal judgeship and the sort of work that Federal judges do, how interesting is it. To the extent that the Federal judge is no longer trying cases, deciding motions and that sort of thing, but simply reviewing what subordinates do, I think the job is going to be less attractive. There will always be plenty of people lined up for Federal judgeships, but the question is are they the people that you want to have Federal judgeships.

I think we should be thinking very definitely about a national Court of Appeals or an intercircuit tribunal, as I indicated to the chairman when I answered his question.I think some more thinking is going to have to be done, and to me, this is the area in which the next Chief Justice could devote some attention not with the idea that I am bringing in some ideas that I know exactly what ought to be done, but let us get some people to sit down and look and think about what is going to be done.

I should think it would be extraordinarily important.

I do not agree with the Chief Justice on that point. I think that 20 or 25 years ago all the courts, State courts and Federal courts simply worked at a more leisurely pace, and it may very well be there was a little more time for ripening of ideas and that sort of thing.But I just do not think with the kind of litigation explosion that we have had in the last 20 or 25 years courts should or really can aspire to go back to that. I think they have to work a little bit faster and quite a bit harder up to the point where you get to a certain point where you become kind of a bureaucracy, and you begin sacrificing all of the contemplative aspects. That is not good either.But I think the 150 cases that we have turned out quite regularly over a period of 10 or 15 years is just about where we should be at. The certiorari cases, the number grows every year. I think you cited the figure 5,100 this past year.They take time and the more of them there are the more time they take, but even 5,100 of them do not take a substantial minor fraction of the Court's time to dispose of, I do not think.I think it would be on the order of somewhere 20, 25 percent of the Court's time spent disposing of certioraris, and I am just guessing, because I am guessing on the figures in my own chambers, and I really do not have any basis for saying how much the other chambers put in on certiorari.

Senator Kennedy, I have a copy with me, if I might get that. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I cannot recollect them. Were you reading from the document? 

If that is from what I said in 1971 I think they are correct. Yes. 

I do not believe so, Senator. It has been a long time, some 20 years ago, but the name does not certainly ring a bell. 

Since I do not know him, I certainly do not know any reason why he would make that statement. 

NO, I do not, Senator. 

NO, I do not. 

I do not believe so, Senator. No. Does he say the year Bob Morrison was running against Paul Fannin? 

Well, that would have been 1958, I think, which would be 28 years ago. No, I do not really think I do. 

I do not believe I do, no. 

Yes, I do. 

Would you read me again what Mr. Brosnahan says that I did. 

NO, I do not think that is correct. 

NO, I do not believe they are. 

I would think I would, yes. 

Well, Senator, I gave my best recollection in 1971. I reviewed that statement, and that stands as the best of my knowledge. So I suppose if they say I did something that I have said I did not do, I would have to say, yes, they are wrong. 

Really do not know. 

I think they are mistaken. I just cannot offer any further explanation. 

I do not think the ballot security program as you refer to it took on that name until 1964. Before that I think it was just called poll watching or challenging. I have no idea whose it was. 

When you refer to these activities, Senator, that may cover a lot. 

Would you read them to me again? 

Yes, I do deny that. 

Yes, I do deny that. 

I deny that. 

I am sure he is mistaken as to the latter part. It is perfectly possible that I could have arrived at a south-148 west Phoenix polling place with a couple other people, and again, I gather he is not definite as to the years, because one of my jobs as notice reading what I said in 1971 and recalling as best I can now, was to go to polling places where our challenger was not allowed into the polling place or if a dispute came up as to something similar to that, either I or along with my Democratic counterpart would go.So it is not at all inconceivable that I would have been with a group of two or three other people going to a southwest Phoenix polling place in whatever year that was. But the later part is false.

I think that is correct. 

Senator, let me beg to differ with you on that point, if I may. I thought your question was challenging. Now you say harassing or intimidating. As to harassing or intimidating, I certainly do categorically deny anytime, anyplace. If you are talking about challenging, I have reviewed my testimony, and I think I said I did not challenge during particular years. I think it is conceivable that 1954 I might at least have been a poll watcher at a westside precinct. 

I think it was simply watching the vote being counted. 

I do not think so. But a challenge 

A challenger, Senator, was someone who was authorized by law to go in the polling place and frequently the function was not to challenge but to simply watch the poll, watch the vote being counted. 

But to be a poll watcher at that time, I think you had to be a challenger. 

I do not think so. 

I am not entirely sure. I cannot recall ever challenging any person, but you are talking about a period 

NO. I have responded in each case that you said to say that I did not agree with it, but if you are asking me149 whether over a period from 1953 to 1969 I ever challenged a voter at any precinct in any election, I am just not sure my memory is that good.

What does the rest of the affidavit say? 

Well, I answered all your questions the best I can. 

I do not believe I was. 

My present recollection 24 years later is that no, I did not know it. 

Not that I recall. 

I have met Senator Campbell. I had met him in Arizona. No, I do not. 

It is difficult for me to think back that long. It seemed to me there was a Republican, or some Republican, some type of version of the, perhaps a precursor of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, that would have extended Federal coverage to interstate highways, and that sort of thing, and that had always seemed pretty sensible to me. 

Well, supported it is 

Well, you read about it in the paper. You think, you know, this might be a good idea. 

Well, Senator, if you mean by support, publicly announce in favor of, no. 

NO. 

Right. Because I had thought it was 

Correct. 

Your question, Senator 

NO, other than what I have said, I think that is it. 

Senator, recalling as best I can after this lapse of time, at some point there I was counsel to the Republican county committee.

I think it was on the county level, but it might have been on the State level for a short period of time. I honestly cannot remember. 

Giving legal advice to the county committee, I think. 

I would think so, yes. 

Well, the only State I was ever active in, really, was Arizona, and it certainly was normal there. 

Yes. The statutes authorized challenges. 

Certainly, but I think the Republicans were the first to get active, but I think the Democrats became active very shortly afterward. 

Yes. I am not sure that I was ever chairman of the entire program, even in Maricopa County, Senator Laxalt, and again, I would refer back to the statement I made in 1971, because my reflection, my recollection was a good deal more closer then than it is now. I think that I was chairman of the lawyers group which was active on election day, and before hand, doing the sort of things that you mentioned. I am not sure that I was ever chairman of the entire program, say, recruiting the challengers, and that sort of thing. 

It certainly was in Arizona. 

Yes. 

A supervisor of lawyers. I do not think I had responsibility for the overall program.

I think that is accurate, Senator. I think most challenges, when the program started out, were on the basis of residency. But again, let me repeat what I said to Senator Kennedy: that the usefulness of the challenger program, as I recall it, to the Republicans, was that it was the only way we could get a person in the polling place to watch what was going on. Because although State law provided for two persons of one party, and one person of another party to constitute the election board, that constituted, that ran the election, in some very heavily Democratic precincts, that person, the person on the election board, had to be a resident of the precinct. And we simply could not find, in some precincts, a Republican to be a member of the election board.And so there would be a two-person or a three-person election board of the opposite party and the only way we could get someone who was of the Republican faith—if you want to call it that—into the polling place at all, to see that things went on as normal—was to put them in as a challenger.

Well, I agree with you a hundred percent. 

Yes, I have stated it in 1971, and I state it again now. 

Correct. 

NO. I do not. 

DO you know when he was Democratic chairman? 

NO, it still—I am sorry—it still does not refresh my recollection. 

Yes; that is correct. 

Does the statement say where I was? 

Oh. 

Yes, I can, Senator. 

I guess the first qualification I feel I have is nearly 15 years service as an Associate Justice which enables me to, or I hope will enable me to perform a large part of the Chiefs responsibilities without having much difficulty getting started. I have sat at the conference table for 15 years, and I know how conference discussions go. I know the procedural niceties which any institution has, which may not be terribly important, but they are the way any institution works, and someone coming in from the outside and getting used to the—it just takes a while to get used to how things are handled. So, I think that is a valuable experience. And I think 15 years of getting to know the other eight people, although I of course have not known all of them for 15 years, is a very valuable asset. It will not be a group of strangers to me, obviously. And I also think—perhaps I am being immodest—that I have a very real interest in the Federal judicial system and the American judiciary. I have a great interest in the Supreme Court and its work. But I have a very great interest in trying to see improvements made, not just in the lower Federal courts, but seeing what might be done through the Center for State Courts, in helping State courts, at least getting financial assistance to them without trying to tell them what to do. 

Senator, I think the position of Chief Justice is an awesome position just because it is the No. 1 judicial position in the United States of America. I do not think it is because of the awesome power, that the Chief Justice possesses. I tried to indicate, in answer to the Chairman's question, and in answer to Senator Mathias's question, that the Chiefs prerogatives in the conference, the prerogative of assigning opinions, and the prerogative of lead-154 ing conference discussion, while important, are seldom, if ever, ones that he can use to foist his judicial ideas, his jurisprudential ideas, off on an unwilling colleague.But it is because it seems like, with the increasing caseload of all the courts, that we are looking at real problems, and not just in the Supreme Court, and not just in the Federal judiciary, but in the entire American judicial system. And the Chief Justice is a visible spokesman for those concerns. That I think it is an awesome responsibility.

The Chief Justice, Senator, has been referred to as primus inter pares, the first among equals, and I have a feeling, from the way you described the power of the majority leader, that he is a good deal more equal than the majority leader. The Court, by vote, grants certiorari in a case to bring it up for review. It takes four votes in the conference to bring the case up for review.The Chief cannot bring a case up for review himself. The cases are generally placed on the docket in the order in which certiorari has been granted. So the Chief, as far as I know, has no particular power in deciding, well, we will hear this case out of order, or, we will hear these cases because I want to hear them, even though they were filed later.It is all, so far as I know, virtually a mathematical thing, in the order in which the cases are granted. So, the Chief has virtually no control, singlehandedly, over the cases the Court will hear, or the order in which it will hear them.

NO, I do not, Senator. No, I do not. 

I do not think that claim can be credibly made, Senator. I think that the constitutional positions I have taken in some cases involving the equal protection clause, have resulted in less favorable rulings, or votes on my part, for women's rights issues, and for some issues involving blacks, and other minorities, than would a broader construction of the equal protection clause. But I have taken the same position on the equal protection clause with respect to corporations. It is nothing peculiar to the155 fact that blacks, and minorities are invoking it. It is simply the fact that I read the equal protection clause, giving it the best interpretation I know how, somewhat more narrowly than some of my colleagues.

I think it has. 

I do not believe so, Senator. The Congress has taken over a great deal of the protections of women's rights, and things like title VII of the Civil Rights Act. And I authored an opinion for the Court just this past June, I think, the Meritor Savings case, where we held that harassment in the workplace was the responsibility of the employer, even though not performed directly by the employer. It certainly was regarded, I think, as a victory for the cause that you are talking about. 

Well, I hope no bias, blatant, or otherwise, Senator. 

Yes. It does. 

Yes, it is, Senator. 

I think and believe that you are right. 

I do not presently recall it that accurately, but if that is what I said in 1971, I certainly stand by it. 

NO. I do not believe I did. 

In the process of challenging them? 

NO, certainly not in a voting booth. 

Not that I can recall. 

It certainly does not come back to me at this time, in 1986. 

Did I ever ask a voter to read from a card? No. I do not think I did. 

TO what question? 

My answer would be the same. 

Not that I recall. 

They are certainly wrong, yes. 

Yes. 

The ones that you have referred to, yes. 

Confront them in the sense of harassing or intimidating? 

And does this cover Bethune precinct for all years? 

I do not believe I did. 

If it covers 1953 to 1969, I do not think I could really categorically say about anything. 

NO. NO, I do not. 

Well, to the best of my recollection. You are talking about something in 1953; it would have been 33 years ago. 

Senator, challenging was a perfectly legitimate thing. 

I believe I told the Senate, Senator, in 1971, over a given period of years, I did not think I had challenged some, and I stand by that testimony. I think you are broadening it to go way back into the early 1950's.

I do not believe I did, no. Again, I point out that that is 30 years ago.

I do not think so, no. I cannot imagine why I would have had one. I have no recollection. 

I think he is. 

AS to the first part, Senator, if he saw—he certainly could have seen me giving instructions to challengers in a polling place. As to the second part, would you read that again. 

I have no recollection of that, no. 

We gave instructions to challengers generally the night before the election, or maybe two nights before the election. Read the statute to them, told them what could lawfully be done, what could not lawfully be done. 

Well, I think I said in my 1971 statement to the committee, Senator, that on one occasion, in some polling place—and I do not think I specified it then, and I certainly do not remember it now—I came upon one of our challengers exercising challenges in what I thought was an unlawful manner, and told him to stop. 

I have only the most general recollection now, and I think I stated, in more detail, in 1971. I think it was a committee to assist in the poll watching and challenging process in the 1960 election.

I would think that we probably had some sort of a challengers' school at which one of the lawyers spoke. At this passage of time I could not say whether it was me, or somebody else.

Yes. 

Yes. 

I did not detect inconsistencies. 

Those challenges that Judge Hardy described were not following the instructions that they got from the lawyers group. 

I think I said in the affidavit that you just quoted that I learned about it late in the day. 

I do not remember it. 

Yes, I suppose one could read it either way. The "I's" in it certainly could have been mine rather, just looking at it as a text, rather than Justice Jackson's. 

He did in the second argument. Chief Justice Warren, however, says that in the conference after the argument in December 1952, that the views Justice Jackson expressed were contrary to what he ultimately came up with.

Justice Jackson was a great believer in the idea of whatever you want to call representative democracy, the Court having made mistakes in the past by reading its own moral views into the Constitution. And much of the theme of the one and a half page memo is along those ideas that the Court has run afoul in the past by reading into the Constitution what it felt were the morally right views, only to find that it had made a mistake. And this apparently was an effort to apply those ideas to the Brown case.

IS that a question, Senator? 

I have tried to explain that the theme of the memo, the failures of the Court in the past was a very strongly held value of Justice Jackson. 

I am familiar with both of those quotes, yes. 

They are certainly true quotes in the sense that I am sure that Don Cronson said them. 

I think it is, Senator. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I am, Senator. And I made an excerpt here of a case in which I joined the Chief Justice's opinion in a case called Milliken against Bradley. 

Where the Court said—this was not just kind of citing Brown as authority—here is what the Chief Justice's opinion said in that case. Ever since Brown v. The Board of Education, judicial consideration of school desegregation cases has begun with the standard, and this is a quote from Brown, "In the field of public education, the doctrine of separate but equal has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." And the Chiefs opinion goes on to say this has been reaffirmed time and again as the meaning of the Constitution and the controlling rule of law. 

Yes. Yes, I did. 

Senator, I am not sure there were four other colleagues on the opinion. I think there might have been just a total of four people, maybe even a total of three people on Justice Powell's.

TO the best of my recollection, yes. 

Yes. I have a feeling that as to whether the judgment of the court of appeals should have been affirmed or reversed, there were five to—I am not sure. But the more I think about it, it seems to me it came out 5 to 4, but I could be wrong on that. 

That is certainly the best of my recollection, Senator. But I want to state that it was a fairly complex fact situation 

Of course, the opinion itself would be the authoritative statement of what the facts were. 

I certainly agree with you 100 percent on that, Senator. 

Yes, I do. 

I draw back a little bit at paraphrasing there, Senator, because we had the Wygant case and we had a couple other cases up there, and your summary may be entirely accurate. But I'm loath to subscribe to it unqualifiedly without a better recollection. 

Yes, I did. 

Yes, I did. 

Senator, that's an issue that was before us in the Stotts case; it was again before us in Wygant and a couple of other cases. It is going to come before the Court again, I'm sure. It's a very critical issue right now.

If you would forgive me, I think I would prefer not to comment on it. 

I'm glad you see it that way, Senator, and I agree with you. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Only in this very possible way, which I would not think would be a correct answer to your question. But if you say you were discouraging minority voters by putting a challenger in at precincts which were heavily Democratic and which certainly had a number of minority voters voting at them, in order to lawfully take advantage of the State law which permitted observing the election board functioning and challenging as provided by law, one could say, I suppose, that that did discourage minority voters. But not lawful minority voters.So if you would just amend your question to say lawful voting by minorities, I could answer unqualifiedly "yes".

NO. 

In the years that we are talking about in the 1971 affidavit which I think is 1958 through perhaps 1968 or something like that, and I think I stated that I was not myself, I did not myself challenge during that time.

I cannot say going back way further into the 1950's that I was not, and one of the reasons it is hard to say is because to even watch an election counting in a precinct where youdid not have someone on the election board, the only way to get in, perhaps you recall or maybe the law was changed by the time you younger people came along, was to send someone in as a challenger.Then they would frequently let the person stay to watch the counting of the ballots, but in the years that we are talking about in the 1971 affidavit and conflicting testimony and so forth, I stated as fully as I could on the basis of my recollection in 1971 what I had done in each of those years, summarizing on the basis of a much fainter recollection now.I think my activity was primarily that of a member and perhaps 1 year a chairman of a lawyers committee that tried to tell the challengers in advance what they could do and then one biennial election—I cannot remember which it was—I know that Charlie Hardy and I made rounds on occasion to try to settle

I cannot recall from memory now what a challenger could do. But I notice Senator Metzenbaum and Senator Kennedy said that a challenger could challenge on the basis of reading the Constitution in English and failing to reside at the place where you claim to reside for 30 days before the election.I do not vouch for that. That rings a bell with me. I think perhaps that is the way it was.

I certainly gave that type of advice, reading from the statute probably. I cannot remember exactly what was in the statute.

Well, it sounds perhaps a little more glorified than it was. It was lawyers who would volunteer a couple hours on election day to come over to county headquarters perhaps or sometimes work out of their offices in case legal disputes arose, you know, some question was raised by someone on the county committee somewhere else as to some election practice, and we wanted a lawyer handy to give a legal answer.

Yes, I am. 

I would have no reason to doubt it certainly. I cannot presently think back and say yes. But I have no reason to doubt that.

I remember that name, yes. 

I think I might have heard about it on the phone the day it happened, and I think that I read about it in the paper the next day. 

NO, I do not. 

NO, I do not. 

Harold, I could not give you a face, but certainly the name Harold Musgrave sounds familiar. 

NO, I really do not. 

I recall a committee of lawyers. I could not tell you if there were 12 of them. 

It certainly could have been, yes.

If trouble came up, it was our job to go out and see if we could solve it.

Exactly. Troubleshooting. 

Yes. Our problem, as I recall, was usually getting our challenger into the election place and the Democrat on occasion has complaints about the qualification that our challenger would have. 

Again, I do not have a very clear recollection. 

Senator, I realize that is very much the prerogative of the Chief Justice to keep abreast of matters like that.But I must confess that I am much less abreast of it than I would like to be.I know that the act was passed and that it gives the judicial council, the collective judges of the various court of appeals some disciplinary powers over other judges. And I have a couple instances in mind where I have a feeling that those powers have probably been exercised.But I simply have not made enough of a study of it, and I am not familiar enough with just what each circuit council has done to be able to give an informed answer to your question.

Well, I would certainly think that was something that would merit the serious attention of the Judicial Conference of the United States which has the sort of administrative capacity to see whether the various circuit councils were doing what they were required to do under the law.

Certainly. Certainly. 

Senator, I do not believe that the current caseload is too heavy for the Supreme Court, as I indicated to Senator Mathias. But I respect the Chief Justice's contrary view. He is following Justice Frankfurter's idea, I think, that ideally when you are dealing with very important cases that take a lot of thought and have a lot of arguments, pro and con, maybe a nine-judge court would do better to take 100 cases a year rather than 150. My own feeling is that all the courts are so much busier today than they have been in the past, that there would be something almost unseemly about the Supreme Court saying, you know, ev-erybody else is deciding twice as many cases as they ever have before, but we are going to go back to two-thirds as many as we did before.I think that we can manage to decide 150 and do a reasonably competent job.

I believe very strongly that you should pass that.

I have an opinion which I think may disappoint you to a certain extent, Senator.The Chief Justice proposed in his bill or draft, suggested that they be appointed either by the Chief Justice or the Supreme Court. And I do not regard this as terribly desirable because the Supreme Court as a body, I do not just think it is very good at administrative tasks like that.I believe your bill calls for appointment by the circuit councils? 

And I share some of the Chiefs misgivings about that. They were not expressed the same way I think he expressed them, that it could make the new court a kind of a United Nations where each of the circuit judges is primarily loyal to his circuit or her circuit and the doctrine of that circuit rather than being an independent member of the new court. I think in time and, goodness knows, it is obviously going to take time to ever get the intercircuit tribunal passed, we are going to have to recognize it as a new court with judges appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and not as a borrowing proposition. 

It is my view that in the long range it ought to be new judges appointed. The judges of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit did some careful thinking, and I remember reading their submission to—I do not know whether it was your committee or Congressman Kastenmeier's committee. And they came up with what I thought some very reasonable objection to the proposal as they understood it. And one of them was if the court is just temporary, the court is never going to establish the sort of reputation for excellence that would make its decisions followed by the courts of appeals. And it is going to be controversial with the courts of appeals anyway. I think that is a valid point, that we are going to have to set up an institution that does have prestige and the dignity of brand new judges. 

I think that would be a perfectly sensible way to approach it, Senator.

I do not suppose they can be entirely separated, Senator, since judges are human beings like everybody else. But certainly one mark of a good judge is the extent to which he is able or she is able to separate personal philosophy from judicial decisionmaking. 

Yes, I think I have. 

Senator, I have some reservations about answering that question, and let me tell you what they are. I think that when you have a nominee here who has not much of a prior judicial record, so that it is very difficult to figure out what their judicial philosophy would be. Perhaps the only way the committee has of getting at the nominee's possible judicial philosophy is to ask about personal views on things, thinking that no judge is going to completely succeed in separating personal views from the way they vote.But, in my case, I have been on the bench for 15 years. As you point out, I voted in the Chadha case. I did not join the Chief Justice's opinion. I dissented. But, likewise, as you point out, I did not join Justice White's opinion.I am very loath to give you, and I think I feel perhaps constrained that I cannot give you at the present time, but I think I did work with it when I was in the Office of Legal Counsel before I ever went on the bench, and I remember thinking at that time, as something that had kind of been worked out between Congress and the executives in a way that, you know, might raise considerable legal questions, but it struck me that, as a practical matter, it worked quite well.

Senator, I do not feel I can answer that now in view of the Chadha case.

I think the cases that have come down since I have been on the Court have pretty well established a general approach that, first, you look to the works of the statute that Congress enacted. And if those words are clear beyond per adventure of a doubt, in applying to the particular fact situation before you, you do not go to the legislative history to support any contrary claim.But if there is ambiguity in the application of the words Congress used to these, then you can go to the legislative history to try to clear up the ambiguity.

Well, Senator, I like to think when I do make those pronouncements, I will know more about those issues than I do now. Just because I have not been Chief Justice and have not really organized my thinking. But I think one of the most critical things in American society today is the cost of litigation, and the implementation in some places, but not everywhere, of alternative means for dispute resolution, the tremendous delays that people encounter in getting a dispute settled.I think back to the time when I was in practice, when things were not nearly as congested and the courts were more accessible in the sense that you could get a case tried in 5 or 6 months if you filed it. And some of my clients, we were in a four lawyer firm, and some of our clients were quite small people. And I think to say a material man's lien claimant, a person who put some—either some177 labor or some material on a construction job, the contractor does not pay. So he has got a claim for $15,000 or $20,000 against the contractor.You walk into any good sized law firm nowadays and they will tell you no, we just cannot handle your case. It would cost you more than $20,000 to have us litigate it.Now, some people have kind of scoffed at alternative dispute settling means as kind of a denial of access to the courts. But I know from some of the clients I had back in practice, they wanted their disputes settled. They would have even accepted a negative decision sometimes. But the idea of paying nearly as much as what is involved in order to get a judgment was what really angered them. And, you know, I think that is a real concern that I hope to look into as Chief Justice.

I am reluctant to comment on statutory things except in the area that you picked out, which seems to be so closely related to the way the courts function, that I could not be criticized for responding.I have mixed feelings. I think analytically diversity jurisdiction ought to be repealed. It exists solely by reason of the fears in the early days of the United States that a State Court judge in Iowa could not be fair to a litigant from Missouri. And I simply do not think that there is much ground for that any more.But I have talked to people around the country, and the Bar Associations in the West, I was looking up for Senator DeConcini, because I think the Arizona Bar Association and many of the Bar Associations in the small Western States have taken the position they do not want diversity repealed. Perhaps Iowa has too. And when you start asking them why, they like the option of having two courts. And they generally have the feeling that because the State Court judges are paid less than the Federal judges, that the Federal judges, by and large, are going to be somewhat better judges.And I have also talked to a number of the judges in the lower Federal court, the courts of appeals, and the District Courts, and a lot of them, although they concede analytically diversity jurisdiction should be repealed, they said I would rather try a diversity case than a title VII case, or some other kind of a statutory case because it is more interesting. Or it is the only chance I have to see 90 percent of the lawyers that come into my court is diversity jurisdiction, because that is the only kind of cases that most lawyers in the State have.So I am not sure that you can just say analytically it ought to go contrary to the wishes of a lot of the judges and a lot of the people who think they are benefitting from it.

I do not think it does, although people have argued with me about that too.

I do not think I would have much success in steering the Court down any path that my colleagues did not agree with me on.And on the bright line rules, there is no question but what the typical practicing lawyer, the typical trial judge is going to get more satisfaction out of a case enunciating a bright line rule than out of a case which has a lot of ifs, ands and buts in it. And yet when a case comes to our Court, in some cases we will find we have laid down a bright line rule that sounds great. Then it comes back on slightly different facts, and some of the people who joined it before say, well, gee, if I had known it was going to be this kind of a thing, I would not have subscribed quite that broad language, and it ends up qualified.I think that, Senator, is the nature of the judicial process. 

It is an accurate characterization of the views I expressed in my dissenting opinion in Wallace against Jaffrey last year, yes. 

Senator, with all respect, I feel that since this is a case that—the kind of issue that constantly comes before the Court, I must respectfully decline to answer. 

Senator, you are going to find me obnoxious, I am sure, because there was at least a concurrence, I think, in one of the contraceptive cases that said there was a penumbra of rights that perhaps flowed partly from the Ninth Amendment, and just179 because we recently had a case of Bowers against Hardwick, I forget whether the ninth amendment was directly involved, but it was the same type of case.I just feel I can't answer as to my personal views because I have participated in some cases and they are bound to come again.

Certainly—that have not yet been defined? 

I think the only correct answer to that is that it may develop, as future decisions come down from the Court, that just what you suggest will happen. But it simply can't be predicted one way or the other profitably now. 

I know there have been bills to that effect pending in Congress. There is a case decided right after the Civil War, and let me think 

Correct, right, ex parte McCardle—where the Court seemed to say that Congress did have that power. In fact, it didn't seem to say it; it said it, I think. But then there has been a great deal of, I think, quite hostile criticism of the McCardle case, not from our Court, I don't believe, but from scholars and commentators. And just because that kind of bill has been pending here, again, I don't feel I can express a view on the authority of Congress under article III, section 2. 

Under television coverage in the Supreme Court, if the lights shine in the eyes of the lawyers, the way these lights shine in my eyes, for the sake of the lawyers I would be against it. I have a feeling—and I thought about that, Senator, because I sat back there for a couple of hours this morning, and if I were a lawyer arguing before the Supreme Court, with these sort of lights on me, trying to make contact in my argument with nine Justices, I would be kind of unhappy. If I were convinced that coverage by television of the Supreme Court would not distort the way the Court works at present, I certainly would give it sympathetic consideration. But if it meant a whole lot of lights that would disturb the present relationship between lawyers and judges and arguing cases, I don't think I would be for it. 

I participated in the Chandler decision that the Chief Justice wrote a number of years ago, saying that where Florida had provided that, there was nothing in the Federal Consti-tution that prevented it. So I suppose you would say from that that each State is free to chose for itself.

Yes, it is, Senator. 

Yes, we do. 

In 1974,1 believe. 

Not at the time, Senator. I was advised of it a couple of days ago. 

I certainly thought I did, but I'm quite sure I didn't note that. 

I don't recall, not having it in front of me. I relied on a lawyer in St. Johnsbury to close the title. 

I'm sure I signed whatever deeds were necessary to sign. 

NO, I wouldn't be surprised. 

NO, I don't. 

Yes. 

I was amazed.

Well, I think it's unfortunate to have it there. But it's meaningless in today's world, I think.

The covenant is unenforceable under Federal constitutional law and I think under Federal statutory law. 

Oh, certainly. 

Did I do anything 

I don't know exactly what the point of having it removed from the deed would be, other than to get rid of something that is quite obnoxious, because it's unenforceable now. Is there some procedure under Vermont law where one could have it removed? 

Yes. Yes; I certainly do. And if there is a procedure under Vermont law where one could avoid it or get rid of it, I would certainly go through it. 

You're talking about simply viewing people in public places? 

Well, I think at that time I perhaps wasn't aware of a case that I later became aware of, and it must have been shortly afterwards, because I think a similar question was asked in my 1971 hearings. There was a case decided in the Federal court in Chicago, I think, that suggested that if there was an element of harassment about the information gathering, that that would be judicially enforceable. I certainly agree with that case.

Well, if we're talking about the Constitution, I'm not sure that it does. But it seems to me that's what we have to count on legislatures and Congress for, to regulate where regulation is necessary.

Senator, I am reluctant to answer that question because we have had a couple of cases involving surveillance of people in public places come before the Court, the Knotts case and in the Carroll case. They weren't precisely in this context, but it seems to me that I really have to draw back there. 

Senator, I honestly feel that I can't answer that question. It's the kind of thing that might come before the Court. 

Senator, the transcript of the hearings would certainly be the best version of what I was saying at the time. I don't recall it now, at the time, but I am sure the transcript you're reading from is accurate.

The term "nonjusticiable" troubles me because it could be taken to mean something that, although there is a constitutional violation, the courts can't remedy it. I don't think that's what I was meaning to say.Again, just trying to interpret portions of the transcript you read, I think it certainly could be interpreted to say that, under those circumstances, there was no constitutional violation.

I want to make sure I understand your question. You're not talking about my remark about Tatum against Laird as a case during that hearing, but you're talking about the statement I made about the more general proposition?

Should I have recused myself? 

AS you know, Senator, I wrote a fairly lengthy opinion explaining why I didn't think, under the law applicable then, I ought to have to recuse myself, because I didn't think the law required that simply the public statement of a view prior to going to the bench foreclosed one's consideration of the issue, even though the same view was involved in a litigated case.I realize people might disagree with me, but that was the position I took in that case.

I never thought of it again until these hearings, to tell the truth. I have gone back and read the opinion, and I think, under the statute as it was changed after Laird v. Tatum, I think there would be probably a very strong ground for disqualification. But I didn't feel dissatisfied with the way I had behaved under the statute as it then stood.

Justice Stewart, who was a good friend of mine, I remember, after I wrote this opinion—you know, it may have been months afterwards—he had been on the drafting committee of the ABA standards, and he told me that in some respects he thought my comparison of the ABA standards and the statutory standards was incorrect and that the ABA standards had intended to be more stringent.

I just can't put myself back in that position, Senator, not having the ABA standards in front of me. I really just can't answer.

NO. 

I had—if you would consider information obtained in the course of preparing for the May Day demonstrations, which did involve some military activity, I suppose you would say yes. 

NO. 

NO. I am not. 

Senator, I responded to Senator Grassley a little

Yes. Unobtrusive, in the view not of the television people, but of the Justices. 

Unquestionably. 

Yes. I think they do.65-953 0 - 8 7 - 7

Senator, as you know, I am sure, as well as I, there was a case right after the Civil War, ex parte McCardle, that held that Congress could limit the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court; even require that a case which had already been submitted to the Justices for decision, be dismissed.Since that time, there has been a lot of scholarly criticism, criticism from commentators, something along the lines I think your question suggests. That this thing cannot just be allowed to sweep away the power of the Court to finally adjudicate cases.I know there have been bills pending here, in the last 2 or 3 years, testimony as to their constitutionality, and I feel I cannot go any further than that, for fear that that sort of issue will come before the Court.

Senator, as you can imagine, I would like to oblige, but the fact that the issue is fundamental, and important, does not make it any less one that could well come before the Court. And I think that the approach I have to take is, in a case like that, I ought not to attempt to predict how I would vote in a situation like that.

Well, I think this type of question, like most other questions that lawyers and judges deal with, has elements of degree about it. Whether Marbury against Madison is good law is something that—no one has challenged Marbury against Madison,it seems to me, for a century, perhaps, you know, nearly two centuries.I do not think that the question you pose is quite the—in light of the McCardle case, is quite as totally free from doubt as Marbury against Madison.

Well, there would certainly be some loggerheads there. It might put Congress at loggerheads with—I suspect it would—with the Court.

Well, perhaps it is easy, Senator, and I realize the arguments you advanced are persuasive ones, but even if the question is easy, I do not think that permits me to indulge in speculation about its outcome.

Senator, I understand your position, and I honestly feel that I must adhere to my view that it would be improper for a sitting Justice to try to advance an answer to that question.

Well, when I say open question, Senator, I do not mean one that is 50-50, or something like that, that are equally plausible arguments on both sides. Just it is a question not settled totally by a precedent, that could very easily come before us.

Yes. I think it is. 

Well, I would find it of considerable concern, too, Senator. But that does not make me feel that because I would feel it was wrong, or mistaken, that one would automatically come to the conclusion that it was unconstitutional. 

I would certainly, you know, reconsider my answer—I do have the feeling, and I may be wrong, that Justice O'Connor, in her confirmation hearings, was asked similar questions, and I believe she took much the same position that I am taking. 

I do not recall it in Trimble against Gordon but I remember writing to that effect in a couple of other cases: the Buckley against Valeo case, and I think the First National Bank of Boston versus Valati. And the position I took there, and I think I took it without any support from my colleagues, but it was following a view held by the second Justice Harlan and by Justice Jackson, for whom I clerked, and I think by Justice Holmes at one time—was that the freedom of speech and press clauses were directed against—by their terms, directed against Congress. And that the 14th amendment carried over the general prohibitions of those clauses against the States, but not with, necessarily, the same specificity. And in Buckley against Valeo, I wrote it, a partial dissent from a rather small part of the opinion, because I expressed a view there, that whereas the States had, if there were going to be elections at all, there had to be State regulation of the ballot process, when you vote, how you get on the ballot, and that sort of thing. And there were precedents from our courts saying that there was a fair191 amount of latitude on the part of the States to favor a system which favored the two major parties—the Democrats and the Republicans at the expense of splinter parties.And the position I took in Buckley was that that was perfectly good for the States who had to regulate ballots, but that the Federal Government was more restricted by the first amendment, because if there were going to be elections the States had to step in and establish the process. The Federal Government did not have to regulate the things it regulated in Buckley, in order for elections to take place at all. And so I felt that the Federal statute—and expressed the view in the dissenting opinion—discriminated, unconstitutionally, in favor of the Republican and Democratic Parties against the splinter party.

Well, if you are looking at the language of the due process clause, as I recall it, Senator, it says: "No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law."And the question then becomes, you know, as you know perfectly well, what is included under liberty, or, what provisions from the Bill of Rights are carried over by that language? And I would say that, from the language itself, it is not evident that any particular provisions are carried over, not inexorable; but if you look at the word liberty, and you wonder what kind of liberty are they talking about, surely one liberty was freedom of speech, freedom of the press.So, it seems to me it is quite natural to carry those over. But I do not know that the language of the due process clause, nor necessarily, what I happen to recall about the debates, and that sort of thing, necessarily indicates that the full rigors of the first amendment as applied to Congress, necessarily were to be applied to the States.

Well, if you say that the due process clause incorporates and makes applicable against the States, the first amendment in haec verba, so to speak, the question is answered. If it does that, it does carry it over in precisely the terms that it is applicable to Congress against the State.But I think the argument on the other side, is that—and I think this is made very well in Justice Jackson's dissent in the Beauharnais case—is that there was a good deal of understanding of what freedom of speech meant at the time the Constitution was adopted, that was undoubtedly applicable against the States, but that there were perhaps slightly more latitude allowed to the States than were allowed to the Federal Government.Justice Harlan took that position in his opinion in the Roth case. That the States could proscribe certain kinds of obscenity but that the Federal Government could not.

Most certainly, yes. 

NO. I think I criticized the Everson case in my dissent in Wallace against Jaffrey, not for the result it reached at all, but for its use of the term "wall of separation between church and state," which I felt was simply not historically justified. 

I would certainly make every effort. 

Yes. I will try to, Senator. One occasionally, looking back at times where the Chief Justice has changed, whether it was Hughes to Stone in 1941, or Stone to Vinson in 1946, and you will read press accounts, that the new Chief Justice is expected to "harmonize" the Court and resolve the disputes. He will clear up these five to four decisions, because he is a great negotiator, and that sort of thing.194 Most predictions have just never come true, for the very reasons, I think, that you stated. That if 

Well, OK, what I stated, Senator. If the President appoints a Cabinet member, the President has a great deal of authority over the Cabinet member. If the Cabinet member does not do what the President likes, the President can fire the Cabinet member. But the authority of the Chief Justice over the Associates is just very, very minimal, and you get no kudos from the people who are watching your performance—the law reviews, the bar associations, and that sort of thing—for voting with the Chief Justice. There is just nothing ever said about, you know, let's get one for the Chief. 

The Chief does not correspond to the Gipper, at least in the eyes of Associate Justices, except in those rare situations like Brown, or the Nixon tapes case. And there I think there is a little of that. But generally, each Justice wants to be regarded as totally independent, and you are praised in law reviews, if you are regarded as quite independent of everybody else, and if people vote together. You know, there is the Minnesota twins, or something like that, or the Arizona twins, or something like that. It is regarded as something of a stigma to vote regularly with someone else. My own opinion is it should not be, but nonetheless, the fact that it is perceived that way produces those sort of pressures. Not to join up with any alliance, not to be regarded as carrying water for the Chief Justice, or any other Justice, but just being totally your own person. 

I unreservedly agree with you, Senator. I do not think the State courts or State court judges have ever had a better friend in the Office of Chief Justice than the present incumbent. I like to think that while perhaps not having all the innovative capacities that the present Chief Justice has, I am not sure that there is need for those with all the institutions that he founded. If I am confirmed I will at least follow in his footsteps, and see to it that those institutions work.

Senator, I am interested in working in those areas but I do not think perhaps all of them equally. I certainly would have to find out a great deal more about it.The Miller Center, I know that you know this, Senator, at the University of Virginia, did a very substantial study on the Office of Chief Justice, and there are something like—I forget—50 or 60 statutory responsibilities that the Chief Justice has, which the Associate Justices do not have.So I certainly do not know these by experience at all. I think one of the suggestions that was made by a number of the people who participated in this program at the Miller Center, was that the Chief Justice ought to give serious consideration to delegating some of these responsibilities and perhaps ask Congress to authorize delegation in some situations. Now I know that you introduced a bill a few years ago to provide for a chancellor, who would perhaps correspond partially to a 10th Justice or a Justice for administration, and I believe the provision was that that person would be a delegate of the Chief Justice to preside over the Judicial Conference. Certainly, I think that is an idea well worth exploring.I have a feeling that the consensus of these people in the Miller study seems to be so heavily on the side that there should be some delegation, that the Chief should not keep it all in his own hands. But I would give the most serious consideration to that, hoping that it would enable me to devote time, selectively, to the things that it seemed to me that I could not delegate.

I would regard it as a high priority, Senator. It seems to me there is a great deal of mutual interdependence, whatever you want to call it, between the Congress and the Federal courts. And that does not mean that one should obviously be lobbying the other for things that are not properly lobbied for, or that there be lobbying in reverse.But just the concept of judicial machinery that I think you told me was covered at the Williamsburg Conference—I think Senator Specter also said something like that—I do not think Congress with all of its other responsibilities and the Judiciary Committees of the two Houses, with all of their other responsibilities, are going to necessarily know in detail the problems of the Federal courts, or at least the problems that the judges of the Federal courts see to be those things, unless someone from the Federal courts comes and tells them about them. I would think the logical person to do that would be either the Chief Justice or some recognized delegate of the Chief Justice that the Judiciary Committees had confidence in.

Senator, I think it was Arthur Vanderbilt that said, "Judicial reform is no sport for the short-winded." And I think the Inter-Circuit Tribunal is proving to be that. Since the idea was first advanced more than 10 years ago, many respected students of the subject still have substantial reservations about it. And I have no doubt at all that if Congress would prefer to see a temporary Inter-Circuit Tribunal put in that that is the way it ought to go, rather than have no reform.But ultimately, and I think if Congress could be persuaded, not ultimately but very presently, there ought to be a new national court, frankly recognized as such, with judges appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, who would act as something of a junior chamber of the Supreme Court, to hear primarily statutory cases about which there are presently conflicts in the circuit.It seems to me that this new junior court, or national court of appeals, poses no threat at all to the Supreme Court, because the kind of cases that I envision the Supreme Court referring to them are not the controversial, highly-charged constitutional issues upon which the Supreme Court has staked out positions, but statutory cases where I think most of us would trust five or seven competent198 judges to reach the same result as any other five or seven competent judges, with some differences, naturally. But it would not be doing the kind of, what I think of as the five-to-four work, five votes to four, that our Court often comes up with.I think the sooner that kind of a tribunal is in place, the better off the country will be.

Senator, I have been over the testimony of those hearings, and I am honestly trying to think whether I was or not. I think I was. I am not positive. 

I think I may have been, but I am not positive. 

Previously stated positions, I think, yes. 

Yes, I did. 

Yes, I did. 

I believe it is, Senator. 

The judiciary is kind of fettered by many restraints, many put on it by Congress. Congress has a propensity to create new causes of action every session, and each one of them by themselves may be utterly unobjectionable, perhaps beneficial. But gradually the same thing is happening to the Federal court system as the environmental people saw was happening to Lake Erie 25 years ago. We have a system that has only a finite capacity, and more and more is being expected of it. And it is quite understandable that the system cannot perform quite the way it did in the past and that there are real problems ahead. I think that Congress is going to have to in the near future ask itself, do we repeal diversity jurisdiction. Repeal of diversity of jurisdiction—and I remember looking at some statistics when I went down to Lexington and spoke at the University of Kentucky 3 or 4 years ago; I think the Federal courts in Kentucky have a great deal of diversity jurisdiction, cases based on diversity of citizenship. Now, that would help the district courts a great deal. It would help the district courts in States like Kentucky and the less populous States more than it would help some of the very popular States, where I think there is a smaller percent of diversity jurisdiction. It would help the courts of appeals some, but it would not help them as much as the district courts, because a lot of the diversity cases are strictly demands for money judgment, the kind that can be settled on appeal. Whereas, if you are talking about some more personal claim, a constitutional claim, it is much more difficult to settle that case after you have won a judgment in the district court and are talking about appealing to the court of appeals.Repeal of diversity jurisdiction would not help the Supreme Court of the United States at all, because we never grant certiorari in diversity cases. So that diversity would help at the trial level of the Federal court system; repealing that would help a great deal. It would not solve our problem, the Supreme Court's problem.The national court of appeals situation would help the Supreme Court most of all and not give great benefit to the other courts.What type of help the judges of the courts of appeals feel they need to handle this mounting explosion is something I think they are probably far better to speak up about than I have, and very likely they have spoken.

Senator, I think that a lot of times, Supreme Court Justices are thought to have a far greater grasp of the facts of the professional world and the legal world than they do. It has always seemed to me that the provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the affidavit of bona fides required under rule 11, the provisions for assessment of costs for frivolous motions, that the tools are all there for any district judge who wishes to use them to dispose of frivolous lawsuits the way they are supposed to be disposed of.On the other hand, it may be that there are some judges who do not take advantage of these rules. I cannot think of anything now that comes to mind from what I know as a Justice of the Supreme Court, which does not cover the whole waterfront by any means, that would lead me to think significant changes are necessary to solve the problem of frivolous lawsuits.

Well, do not kid yourself, if I might use that rather familiar term to a U.S. Senator. Because of the in forma pauperis rules, litigants in our Court can file petitions for certiorari without paying costs, and they can file petitions for rehearing when their petitions for certiorari are denied. And a substantial part, not a major fraction, perhaps not a large minor fraction, but a significant minor fraction of the petitions for certiorari we get in our court each year are people who just are outside—to talk about outside the mainstream, they are really outside the mainstream of litigation. They have started a lawsuit in a trial court somewhere, they have lost it, so they bring another suit, and they now name the judge who ruled against them as a defendant. And then they appeal the decision against them to the court of appeals; the court of appeals says no, there is nothing to it. They petition for certiorari; we deny it. They petition for rehearing. And then they start all over again, adding everyone who has decided against them along the way as defendants.Now, this is not a major problem. The courts know how to handle this thing. But I did want to correct the impression perhaps that lots of people share with you, Senator, that frivolous lawsuits do not make it to our Court. They are not granted, but there are efforts made.

I have a feeling that that might be desirable, Senator, but again I do not know. I would want to know more about what is going on in the various district courts, the various courts of appeals before I simply leap to kind of a facile conclusion yet.

I think that is something that might be very appropriately addressed by a committee of the Judicial Conference which would represent people from different circuits, different parts of the country, perhaps district court and courts of appeals201 judges, who would have more hands-on feeling for how this thing is working than, frankly, I would.

I think it does, Senator. I was up at an Allegheny County, PA Bench Bar Conference early in June and talked to several lawyers and a couple judges up there. And it sounds to me that in Pennsylvania they really have a system working that requires arbitration before you go to court, given certain jurisdictional limits and certain other facts. I am obviously not familiar with the details. But my impression, talking to people up there, it is a success, it is well-regarded by lawyers and laymen alike, and the limits have been steadily raised so that now the limit is much higher before you can go directly into court without going through court-attached arbitration.

SO there would be no hearing in any court? 

Well, that is not Marbury against Madison, when I was talking to Senator Specter a while ago. To me, that is not so clear that I feel free to answer it. 

I think the present Chief Justice's proposal of some sort of an impact statement requirement for committees ofCongress which propose bills which create Federal causes of action might be useful if Congress thought it were useful. That is, if you are going to have a new cause of action created, or a new right to sue in Federal court, let us try to figure out how many cases are expected to be brought, and might they be concentrated in one part of the country rather than the other; is this going to take new judges.Certainly, it is always Congress prerogative to create those. But what so often happens is that the causes of action are created, and then the new judges are not forthcoming.

Senator, I would certainly want to give some thought before coming up with a conclusive answer. But I think the business of alternative dispute resolution that I have mentioned to several of your colleagues is probably as important a concern to me as penal reform is to the Chief. 

Senator, I knew David Young. But I am not sure I was head of any classification group. I was part of a project in the Office of Legal Counsel to recommend revision in the classification regulations. It might be that David Young worked with me; if he did, I do not remember it. 

Yes, then that is it.

Oh, certainly, yes. 

Was he on that? 

I certainly do not recall it. If that is what it says, maybe that is the way it was. 

He worked for the group, too? 

And I was chairman of it? [Laughter.] 

NO, I was not. 

NO. 

I agree with you. 

NO, I have no reluctance at all to defend either the Establishment Clause or the Freedom of Religion Clause. Now, I have in my opinions read the Establishment Clause more narrowly than some of my colleagues. For instance, last year in the Wallace against Jaffrey case which, as I recall came out 5 to 4, as to whether the Establishment Clause prevented the moment of silence in Alabama, and I think a majority of our Court held it did, for different reasons, and I and several others felt it did not. Now,obviously, the four of us in dissent took a somewhat narrower view of the Establishment Clause than the five who said it prevented the moment of silence that Alabama had enacted. And I suppose in that sense you could say the person who is in dissent there is not as sensitive to the Establishment Clause as the person who voted to expand it.But I also think, Senator Simon, that these are almost questions of degree and that there is not a tremendous amount of difference there as to the broad principles of the establishment clause are uncontroverted, and those kinds of cases do not get up to us because they are pretty well settled. It is these kinds of frontier-type cases that come up and reflect divisions among us—and I certainly have read the establishment clause more narrowly than some of my colleagues.

I would say partly but not entirely. I mean, I do not think any person who studied my record would have any question as to my fairness or lack of bias toward any litigant or any cause appearing before me. But I think that certainly, groups who are going to have litigation insofar as a broad reading of the equal protection clause are going to see in me not a champion, but someone who more frequently votes against them than someone who would read the equal protection clause more broadly than I would. And in a sense, therefore, you have a spectrum where the person who appears as the champion, perhaps a real champion to women's groups or to minorities, is going to appear as a good deal less of a champion to the citizens of a community who vote and pass a legislative act which is held to be limited by the equal protection clause, because I think, Senator, there are two sides—in fact, it is almost trite to say it—in almost every one of these cases where the equal protection clause, which I think is the main clause, is claimed under and often decided in favor of the people whom you refer to. Every time the equal protection clause is invoked, it means that an act of some State legislature, or an act of Congress, is struck down.Now, certainly, it was intended that the Bill of Rights and the other restrictions on Congress and State legislatures be applied in just that way. But occasionally one gets the sense that it is a victory for the Constitution every time a court invokes a constitutional provision to strike down a law. I do not subscribe to that, and I do not think most people who approach it from that direction would think so, either, because you know, every bit as much as the Bill of Rights are protecting the rights of the individual in this country, we certainly also believe in representative democracy where a majority can make rules that bind the rest of them unless they do conflict with some provision in the Bill of Rights.All I am saying is that more often than one might think sometimes, there are really factors to be weighed on both sides.

Yes, I think I can, Senator. And if I thought in order to do that that I would have to change the philosophy, or the judicial philosophy evidenced in 15 years of decided cases, I do not think that would be a proper thing for me to do, except perhaps where there are constraints that there ought to be a court opinion rather than a plurality opinion. Those are not the principal things I am sure you are asking about.But I think the Chief Justice as symbol has so many nonadjudicative functions—you know, whom he speaks to, whom he works with and that sort of thing—there, believe me, my door would be open as wide as anyone else's door in that office.

I would respond to that by rejecting it quite emphatically. You know, that is not to say that I do not have ideas, which I certainly have followed; I have a sense of what I think the Constitution means. But it certainly is not a sense that is, fixed in concrete at all. I am one of the few members of our Court who can present both exhibit A and exhibit B in support of open-mindedness. On two separate instances since I have been on the Court, I have written opinions for the Court overruling earlier opinions that I have written, which certainly is some testimony to openmindedness.

United States v. Scott, overruled Jenkins; and either Davidson or Daniels this past term, overruled a significant portion of Parratt against Taylor. 

Well, I have thought about it, frankly, since I called on you and you mentioned it to me. And I think there is a tendency—I think judges have much more of a tendency to—I cannot think of the expression—something about "pulling the wagons around" or something like that—than people in public elective life, the way Senators are. Just because—particularly on our Court, where there are only nine seats, the health of every individual Justice is an endless subject of speculation. You know, is he sick, or really sick? And I went through that when I was in the Justice Department in 1971, when Justice Harlan was ill in the hospital, and Justice Black was ill in the hospital. Some of the calls I got from people I knew in the press were almost goulish. And perhaps that is it partly, that I have brought with me a sense that so long as I can perform my duties, I do not think I have any obligation to give the press a health briefing.But I also see the point you made when you and I talked, and particularly in the office of Chief Justice, I think I would have to approach it differently.

If that is a quote from my testimony, it certainly is.

Again, yes; if that is what the statement says, that is correct.

Yes. 

I do not recall it now, but I recalled it in 1971,1 think. 

That is correct. 

Senator, if I am confirmed, I think I perhaps ought to sequester myself for a short period of time until I understand the job better, and then I certainly propose to behave just as you suggest.

Yes, I have. I think I have visited, you know, a great number of law schools. As you well know, I visited the University of Wyoming Law School in Laramie last year.

Yes. I have the feeling—I enjoy that, and I certainly hope to, if it is possible. But I have the feeling from some of the concerns expressed by the Senators and some of my own feeling that there is probably work to be done in the sense of the Brookings-type meetings at Williamsburg and some of the other duties that the Chief Justice has that are not going to enable me to enjoy that sort of thing as frequently as I did when I was an Associate Justice.

I will certainly try, Senator. I think I saidsome time earlier today that since the Supreme Court has so ex-pansively construed Congress' power under the commerce clause,that how power actually is divided between the States and Con-gress is now very much a matter for Congress to decide and nolonger that much of a constitutional question.And as to how Congress exercises that power, certainly that isnot a judicial question in the ordinary sense. But my personal pref-erence has always been for the feeling that if it can be done at thelocal level, do it there. If it cannot be done at the local level, try itat the State level, and if it cannot be done at the State level, thenyou go to the national level.And I suppose much of the difference in how many Federal laws,how many State laws we have depends on how people think howwell the local and State governments are doing. But I certainly share the concerns you expressed, and I think that the decisions our Court has handed down in the area are an effort to fairly divine the intent of Congress to whether a Federal law shall prevail or where a State should prevail when the two conflict.And that, really, I think is about the extent of the function of our Court in that area.

Well, certainly, it is a fundamental principle that it is the legislative bodies that make the law and the courts that interpret the law. But when you get to some of the broad phrases of the Constitution, you know, what does due process of law mean; what does equal protection of the law mean.When the constitutions are drawn in those phrases, you are drawing them in a way that necessarily is going to give the judges some authority to—some latitude to construe them, just because their meaning is not self-evident at all.And I think the general differentiation in that area between judicial activism is perhaps seeking to cure a social evil by an expansive construction of the Constitution. And I think my record of 15 years on the bench reflects that I do not subscribe to that view.I think that it is—the meaning of the Constitution is best possibly found from relevant materials that you have got to be guided by, even though it does not lead necessarily to the solving of the social evil.But in other areas, we have real problems of determining intent because Congress—I will be frank to say that I think Congress does not legislate as carefully now as it did 30 or 35 years ago, perhaps, when I was a law clerk, when I was in law school.Perhaps it is because the bills are 200 pages long, and that sort of thing. And frequently we get cases where I must say that it looks like the proponents of the bill have been given the right to draft section 1 and the opponents of the bill have been given the right to draft section 2, so that the result is you read one section of the statute and it seems to mean one thing; you read another section and it seems to mean another thing.And there, again, it is not really a matter of judicial activism. It is a question of trying to find out what Congress meant, but often being quite unsure about it.

Senator, I do not think I ought to address a specific question of how Congress could go in regulating this, in view of the separation of powers. I would like to address myself to a point you made in your question and something that I have expressed concern with in an opinion I filed a couple years ago—I think there were only two of us on the opinion—and that is the authority that is given to agencies to preempt State laws, as opposed to Congress.There is no question, Congress, under the commerce power, can preempt as much State law as it chooses to do so. But I have always felt it was another kettle of fish, if not jurisprudentially, at least practically, for the agency to say, well, now, we are preempting the law, the State law, where perhaps Congress has not specifically given them the authority at all.I think that is an area we are going to see more of, and in my de la Cuesta dissent, I think I expressed some of the concerns that you are questioning.

That is exactly the word I would use, Senator, is balancing. And just as I said to Senator Simon about the equal protection clause in that area, the constitutional rights of the defendants are essential and vital.But they also stand against the right of society and limit the right of society, in the traditional view of criminal law, to apprehend the guilty and exonerate the innocent.And, obviously, it was intended that the Bill of Rights have this restrictive function, but I have expressed the view in my opinions212 that this endless expansion of constitutional rights for defendants by judicial construction is not a welcomed thing because it does tend to impair in a way that the Constitution did not intend to have it impaired, the right of society to fairly and justly administer criminal law, with proper respect not just for the defendant, but for the victim and for the social interest in seeing the law enforced.

Certainly, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you, Senator. 

I am aware of that, Mr. Chairman. 

I do not have any perception of how that occurred, Senator. I did not participate in the case. I do not believe I saw any of the circulations. And it is just, really, as if I had not been there.

I think the Chief Justice probably has a greater obligation than anyone else on the Court in those very rare, great cases where it is apparent that unanimity would be highly desirable to not only try to get colleagues together by way of consensus, but to himself adapt some of his views. 

YOU are talking about cases in which I dissented in lone dissent?

I do not have those readily before me. And I am trying to think whether any one of them might have. My feeling is no. 

I do not believe I can, Senator, and the reason for that is that I think that would be a form of being called to account here before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a judicial act which I performed as a member of the Supreme Court of the United States. My opinion, of course, is available, explaining reasons. But how I came to that conclusion I think is something that I think ought not to be inquired into here. 

They would be better spokesmen than I would, but I should think—I do not know seminal, but I would say important. 

Senator, if I might, the Bob Jones case was a statutory case, not a constitutional case in any significant way. 

The end result would have been that that would have been left up to Congress. Congress could have changed the law, as I saw it in my dissent, simply by a legislative act. 

Right. 

Yes, I think it is. 

I would be happy to answer them. 

I do not know, Senator. 

I was not a party to the conference discussion or any of the discussions of the Court on the Brown case. 

I do not know if it was you, Senator Metzenbaum, or Senator Biden, that asked me about this yesterday, but one thing I said yesterday was that the thesis which is very roughly and very shortly, certainly, developed in the memo that most of the Court's mistakes up to that time had been reading its own moral notions into the Constitution was a view that Justice Jackson was a champion of. His entire book, "Struggle for Judicial Supremacy," is devoted to that thesis.I also would like to point out—and I think that would conform to what I said yesterday—that one reason that makes me think it was not simply a memo of my views to him is that the bald statement that Plessy was right and should be reaffirmed was not an accurate reflection of my views at the time.Also, I think that the tone of this particular memorandum is not the tone of a law clerk even expressing a great deal of his own opinions and submitting to a Justice; it is a tone of one equal speaking to another.

I am certainly not saying that, Senator. The reason I know of the authenticity—I had no recollection in 1971 and do not have now of ever having actually sat down and written out these particular memos. I recognize the typescript. This was the way the office proceeded. I am sure this was typed by me, initialed by me.

Senator, a lot depends on what you mean by "my memo." If you are suggesting that I am saying that someone else prepared the memo, no. The memo was prepared by me, typed by me.The question that I understood you to be asking is whose views does the body of the memo contain. And there, I have answered you, I think it is principally, in fact, entirely, Justice Jackson.

Yes, I think there are. 

I think they were on occasion in Justice Jackson's chambers. 

It was not necessarily that he would say, "You do not agree with this position so make an argument." But he would say, I want both sides presented." 

NO, no, I do not. 

Yes, I certainly tried to make clear to the committee that I did not agree then, and I certainly do not agree now, with the statement that Plessy against Ferguson is right and should be reaffirmed.

NO, I do not. 

Yes, I certainly do. 

Yes, I think it does. 

If you are asking me, Senator, whether under the Constitution 

Yes; if a claim is made under the 14th amendment on behalf of a permanent resident alien, a court would have to decide it. 

Yes, I think on behalf of the Justice Department, I presented the administration's view that the ERA should pass. 

Should pass, yes.

I think it was in 1971. It was when I was in the Justice Department. 

I presented testimony which had been prepared for me. 

NO. I would think it would be in the records. As I recall, it was a House committee, because I remember Congressman Wiggins gave me a very hard time on the testimony. 

Yes, it is. 

I had reservations, I think, at the time. You know, I could see arguments pro and arguments con. But I do not think I was as enthusiastic—I thought there were more problems with the ERA than the administration's position would have indicated. 

Yes, yes. 

Oh, sure; I am sure there was discussion back and forth, and it was just simply resolved. 

Yes, I did. 

I think generally, yes, Senator, that if one sees a constitutional issue a particular way and simply is not persuaded, that in most cases it is a part of a function of a judge to say something in dissent. I think on statutory cases, it may be somewhat different. The ballgame is over when the Supreme Court decides a statutory case. Congress can change the result if they do not like it. And I think there, a dissent, particularly a sole dissent, has a good deal less to be said for it. 

Exactly, Senator. 

Yes. 

I never thought a great deal about it, to tell the truth. It is regarded as some evidence of the strength of the majority opinion, the number of dissents it attracts. But I had never thought there was a lot of difference between one Justice and two Justices dissenting, other than the obvious fact that the numbers are different. 

Yes, I think that is quite right, Senator. 

I think so, when compared with a number of my colleagues; the number of times I have been with the majority as opposed to in dissent is greater for me than with some of my colleagues. I am by no means the person that is most often with the majority. 

Yes, I am. 

Certainly, we owned a home in Palmcroft, AZ from about 

Yes, that sounds right. 

Yes, that sounds right. 

NO. 

I believe early 1969. 

I certainly do not recall it, no. 

It is 1961. I simply cannot answer that, Senator. It was a title company transaction, I think, and one relies on the title company for the sufficiency of the deed. I simply cannot answer whether I read through the deed. 

I certainly have no recollection of it. 

Would I 

Well, if a lawyer were handling the thing for me, and there were any sort of a complicated warranty, I think I would tend to rely on the lawyer.

Your question is would I examine a warranty deed now?

Oh, no, certainly not. 

NO. 

Yes, I would. 

Well, in terms of—yes, I think I would. 

It simply had not occurred to me. 

Well, the discussion today, or last evening certainly has brought it out. [Laughter.] 

Well, I must say my normal approach in looking at a statement, or a statement of title, was does it convey good title and that sort of thing. I certainly not only thought, but knew, that this sort of a covenant is totally unenforceable and had been for years, since a Supreme Court decision a long time ago.So, while very offensive, it has no legal effect. 

I am sure I must have. 

I cannot answer from my own knowledge, but certainly, we had done nothing to remove it, as I recall, in the years—I would think it probably was. 

Yes, I did.

Senator, as you say, I prepared a memorandum considering the request that I disqualify myself in deciding that I was not obliged to, and that I should not. I think disqualification is a judicial act, and I do not believe that I ought to be in a position here of defending something that I did in that capacity as a Supreme Court Justice.

That I was performing a judicial act, and that

NO, it is not a governmental legal sanction, in my opinion.

Well, certainly the Posse Comitatus Act places substantial limitations in that area.

Well, as I say, I think that was unauthorized and reprehensible. I do disagree with you as to the first amendment question.

I agree with that it can't collect it by compulsory process.

Well, to say that I say they can do it sounds either like I am advocating they do it or that Congress can't prevent it or that^ Congress has authorized it, none of which propositions do I agree with.My only point of disagreement with you is to say whether as in the case of Tatum v. Laird that has been pending in the Court-of Appeals here in the District of Columbia that an action will lie by private citizens to enjoin the gathering of information by the execo-tive branch where there has been no threat of compulsory process and no pending action against any of those individuals on the part of the Government.

I am not certain what use was made by the information gathered by the Army. The Justice Department has its own investigation made at the time a person seeks employment and, so far as I know, the information gathered by the Army was not used by the Department.

Certainly I agree when the Government seeks to obtain it either by threat of discharge from a job or by threat of compulsory process.. 

Oh, very much so, Senator. If you are the swing vote in putting together a five-judge majority, you have some leverage, obviously, but so does everyone else. The opinion, if there is division among the five, is apt to be a composite; whereas if you are a sole dissenter, you are writing only for yourself. 

There is no doubt that when a Justice is assigned an opinion to write where the majority has only five people in it, the Justice cannot just write the ticket the way the Justice himself sees it. You have to accommodate the views of the four other people whom you hope to join your opinion. So, there is often compromise, because it is unlikely that five people are going to see any important issue just exactly alike. And, on the other hand, as you point out, when you are writing for yourself, there are not those constraints on you. 

Yes; I did. I completely agree with your characterization of me, and the statement that I plan to do something about it is correct, and I will see that it is done. 

The last couple days. 

I frankly have not, Senator. I have been so busy with these hearings that I simply have not devoted myself to anything else. 

I intend to write the lawyer in Vermont who handled the transaction for me today when the hearings are over, if they are over for me today. 

Senator, you said yesterday that you thought Justice O'Connor in her hearings had answered a similar question. I still have considerable reservations about it, whether I ought to do it, but I am sure you are correct, if one of my colleagues has felt that that was proper, I certainly will resolve doubts and try to give you an answer.The answer obviously is not one that comes with the benefit of reading briefs, hearing arguments, conferring. It is very much of a horseback opinion; it has to be in a situation like this.And I think that it would be very hard to uphold a law which carved out certain provisions of the Constitution such as you are describing, the first amendment, and said the Court should have jurisdiction over everything except first amendment cases.

That is correct. 

Not that I recall, Senator. I believe there were two law clerks each in most chambers at that time. 

I honestly do not, no. 

Senator, it is 32 years ago, or whatever it is. I just have very great difficulty remembering whether something like that might have been said or might not. I am sorry. 

I do not think you would say my practice had a large element of real estate in it. I know I handled some commercial closings on occasion, but I do not think it was a significant element. 

Senator, Arizona was pretty much of a title insurance State. That is, the title companies had taken over from the lawyers, at least by the time I left, most of the kind of title opinion work. And people who were simply handling a real estate transaction did not feel they needed lawyers.But I think the title insurance company report followed exactly the procedure that you suggest, a notation of the covenant in question and the notation that it was void.

Yes, certainly, constitutionally, I feel that way any time the Constitution speaks to the question. I think I said yesterday in answering a question from Senator Broyhill that a lot of those decisions are really nowadays for Congress rather than for the Court, because the commerce power of the Congress is so sweeping. It is a question whether Congress leaves part of it to the States rather than whether the courts are going to set aside part of it for the States.

Well, certainly Congress has never made the slightest suggestion that any State law, any State criminal law of the area you describe should be superseded. And I would be very, very reluctant to read that into anything read by Congress.The Bill of Rights, applicable to the case, obviously limits the way a State can proceed against someone who has violated its criminal laws, but it certainly does not say that you cannot have the criminal laws.

Well, my belief in that area is certainly that the civil tort area is one of the few Congress has still left to the States, and it would be nice to see them keep it for a while.

Stare decisis is the principle, of course, that once a case has been decided—let us take the Supreme Court, forexample, because that is what I have been nominated as Chief Justice of—once the Supreme Court has decided a case, that that decision settles the law for the future. And I think—and I am not sure that there is a great deal of difference between conservatives and liberals here, though perhaps I am wrong—when you are looking at a statutory question—that is, let us suppose that in 1950, the Supreme Court has said that a particular act of Congress means thusand-so, and now, 36 years later, someone is coming back and saying, "Well, the Court was wrong in 1950. If you really look at the legislative history and construe the words the way they ought to be construed, it did not mean thus-and-so." I think every responsible judge would reject that sort of an attack, except under the most extraordinary situation, because when you are talking about a statute, Congress can change the result if it does not like the conclusion the court reaches. If you turn to a similar constitutional question that perhaps was decided in 1950, and now you are urged to reverse it and overturn it in 1986, there is more flexibility, more play in the joints, but still a very strong presumption in favor of the earlier decision, it seems to me.But nonetheless, the stare decisis principle has a more flexible application when you are talking about constitutional decisions than when you are talking about simple statutory decisions.

AS to the Arizona property settlement in 1969, I can answer with certainty, because I was back here in Washington by that time, and the house was sold in Arizona. In fact, my wife and kids stayed in Arizona to handle the house sale. So I did not attend that. The Vermont settlement, I do not believe I attended, but I cannot be sure. Since I was represented by counsel there, I have a feeling I probably did not. 

That is my recollection, and of course, signed the necessary instruments. 

Well, we were selling at the time—the deed, yes, I would have, I think, signed it back here and sent it back to Arizona. 

Senator, I just do not remember. 

I would think so. 

It only takes four Justices to grant certiorari. When you say a committee, Senator 

It is just nine people, basically, sitting around a conference table, and it takes four votes to grant certiorari. 

I think obviously it would be a smaller number if you require five than if you require four. 

Well, I suppose it depends in a way on how you define the interest of justice. My colleague John Stevens made the suggestion several years ago that one way to help the court's docket would be to require five Justices rather than four to grant certiorari. And it would help the court's docket in a sense in that you would have fewer cases granted, or perhaps different cases granted. But it would also mean it would be more difficult to get certiorari granted; that someone who now gets a hearing in the court by virtue of getting four votes might not get that hearing if five votes were required. 

Certainly it would limit probably the number of cases the Court takes. I do not right now feel that the court is taking too many cases, but I think some of my colleagues probably do. 

Senator, it sounds trite to say that I am glad you asked that question, but in fact I am glad that you asked that question. That is a matter upon which all nine members of the Supreme Court, I believe, have expressed agreement. And there is notthat agreement on the national court of appeals or on four versus five votes to grant certiorari. I believe all of my colleagues are of the view that the present vestigial mandatory jurisdiction of the court is not necessary for any purpose of justice, and it requires us to hear cases on the merits that we would otherwise not hear.

I would be happy to, Senator. I do feel quite strongly that we need a national court of appeals to provide us with more nationwide decisionmaking capacity. Right now, the Supreme Court is the only body in the country that has the capacity to decide a legal question on a nationwide basis. And I think a properly-constituted national court of appeals could, by taking statutory cases primarily where there is a conflict between the courts of appeals, take some of that burden off of our court so that our court could take on additional cases, perhaps in the Constitutional area. 

Yes, I do, Senator. Let me say that if it were necessary to compromise or change my views on any of the views as to how the judge should be selected, or how it should be staffed, I would cheerfully charge them in order to get the national court of appeals. To me, the other things are secondary matters. But my own view is that appointment by the Chief Justice is unsatisfactory because it gives the Chief Justice too much authority over how this particular court should be constituted. I think that the proposal for selection by the Circuit Councils is unsatisfactory because I think that would turn the new national court of appeals into something like the United Nations, where the judges on it are primarily loyal to where they came from, rather than to where they are coming to. In my view, the ideal solution—and maybe Congress is not yet willing to provide this—is to frankly recognize it is a new court, it is going to be here to stay, that the judges should be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate—new judges. 

Yes, I would. 

I belong to an organization that I think some people might say would fall into that category, and that is the Alfalfa Club.

I do not think the Code of Ethics should be changed, but I think when you understand what the Alfalfa Club is, that I do not believe it meets the standard.The Alfalfa Club is something that I believe has been going on here since 1914, and its only function is to, once a year, hold a dinner. And the Alfalfa Club, as I understand it, is open to men only. And it is not a social club except in the sense that these people get together for dinner once a year, and hear some patriotic music, hear some funny political speeches, and then go their ways for the rest of the year.

Certainly. I would be happy to. 

That is a very difficult question, Senator. May I take a moment to think before I answer?

Obviously, I cannot give you any very good answer. All I can perhaps give you is two or three reactions to what you have just said. I think it is for you to decide, obviously, Senator, the extent to which your differing with me about my Constitutional views is a ground for voting against me as a nominee. I might add, just parenthetically, that my reference, I think, in the Wallace against Jaffrey dissent to Justice Story was not to adopt his view of the church-state, but to simply show that he, as a respected and contemporaneous commentator, back in the first half of the 19th century, took a view quite different than Jefferson's "wall of church and state". I think that if it boils down to basically a difference between—in the mind of a Senator—and as I say, it would be presumptuous of me to say this to the Senators, except you have asked me to say it—what is this confirmation process all about? The President obviously has his role in it, but surely the Senate has its role, too. And the President is a sole individual. He can pick someone without—in other words, he alone nominates, whereas 100 Senators end up voting whether or not to confirm. And I suppose the question is how is the Senate's power to be exercised. And I know a lot of people have spoken on it and written on it. I think you probably have to say that a Senator should not simply say, "This is not the person I would have appointed. I would have rather had someone who felt the religion clause of the First Amendment should be much differently. Therefore, since this nominee does not share my views, I am going to vote against his confirmation." And yet obviously, the Senate certainly, I do not think, is limited to any particular qualifications. I think, again, putting myself in your place, which is very, very difficult, have I fairly construed the Constitution in my 15 years as an Associate Justice. 

NO. I think I have seen that reference. I certainly did not call him "Mr. Justice" in the office. [Laughter.]I think it was really kind of a form of spoof. 

NO, I do not think he is. Again, it is hard to remember back, but I think it probably seemed to me at the time that some of the others simply were not facing the arguments on the other side, and I thought they ought to be faced. 

Well, Senator, I am confused by your question, too, because you say other memos where I refer to my coclerk as a "colleague" 

Yes. 

Senator, I think I answered that question when you asked it yesterday, that I had ideas on both sides, and I do not think I ever really finally settled in my own mind on that.

Well, I am sure, you know, as Don Cronson says, around the lunch table I am sure I defended it for the reasons I stated to you yesterday.

Well, as I said to you yesterday, I thought there were good arguments to be made in support of it. I am sure my talks with Don Cronson were certainly a good deal more detailed than they would be around the lunch table, and I probably expressed myself more fully to him.

Senator, I have written on that subject many times in the 15 years I have been on the Court, and it is almost impossible to encapsulate or summarize.

IS what the question? The one you just read, how much more in addition to 

Yes, I think that is the question and a way of asking what the 14th amendment means. 

I think that was whom it was primarily directed to, but I do not think they meant to limit it to them alone. 

Again, Senator, I have written on that for 15 years in various Court opinions. If we are simply talking generalities 

I am not sure it is entirely correct. I think original intent manifested in the words that the people that drafted the document used is a very important factor in deciding what the provision means. 

Well, there are a number of provisions in the Constitution that are sufficiently general so that they have applicability far beyond what the framers, the people who ratified the Constitution, had before them at the time.In 1787, there was not a steamboat, there was not a railroad, there was not an airplane; yet they gave Congress no power over buggies or over post roads; they said Congress shall have power to regulate commerce among the several States. And that provision is obviously broad enough to embrace any number of things that have come after. And there is a due process clause in the fifth amendment to the Constitution and also an equal protection component in the due process clause.The fact that there were not any public schools in 1787 does not mean that those clauses of broad general applicability would not have application where appropriate to institutions that have come after the Framers.

Yes; it certainly is one result that can flow from it.

Well, I think probably the best answer I can give is to nominate and appoint judges who sense the difficulty involved in judging; that, as Justice Frankfurter said, if putting on a robe does not make any difference to a man—and he put it as a "man" at that time; he would say "to a man or a woman" now, I suppose—then there is something wrong with that person.Someone who thinks that they are going to be able to go on a court and apply a whole bunch of kind of horseback opinions, the kind that you form from reading the newspapers, for example—andI remember this experience, and I daresay an awful lot of other people have had it—of simply reading in the newspapers about a court decision, when I was a lawyer, and saying, you know, "How can that be? That sounds ridiculous." And my wife sits across from me now at the breakfast table, and she will be reading something that the court—and she said, "That is ridiculous." And certainly, when you hear a lot of these decisions described, they sound ridiculous. But sometimes you get back into them, and you see that a surface absurdity really is not an absurdity, in fact, and that your initial reaction to a particular case has got to be tempered by study and that sort of thing.I do not think taking any particular oath is going to get you a better judge.

I thought the stare decisis argument in Plessy was a strong one.

I think it is, Senator. 

Other things being equal, I would think so, yes. 

Yes; again, other things being equal. 

Yes; I think it is. 

Yes. 

I would expect over a period of 3 years I probably did.

I do not believe I have them. 

I do not think so. 

I would certainly waive any claim that I have so far as the Justice Department 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I think in answer to Senator Biden's question yesterday as to reconstructing what my view at that time would have been in 1952,1 said the reasons I thought the thing had arguments on both sides at that time. I think the reconstructing again on the basis of this memo, I would suspect that a logical interpretation in the last paragraph is I perhaps imagined this was the way Justices spoke in conference.Insofar as the statements about, you know, arguing that Plessy against Ferguson was right at the time, law clerks, I do not doubt that is correct. I think there is also an interview with Mr. Cronson in 1971 indicating that I had told him that that was not a correct statement.

I think the opinion speaks for itself, Senator. It is all written out. And I would also want to add that that case, as I recall, was not an Alabama statute requiring prayer in school. It was a statute allowing a moment of silence.

I do not think that is a completely accurate summary of Wallace against Jaffrey. I think that the statement you read, that the 1st amendment, the religion clause, does not require the Government to be neutral between religion and irreligion I think is a correct statement.

I would be outraged. 

Your hypothesis is that the Government requires that you be a member of some religion before you can run for public office. 

I would not think that was the promotion of a particular religion, no. 

Not in my view. 

NO. 

I do not believe that, in my opinion, Wallace against Jaffrey got into the kind of hypotheticals that you are suggesting now, Senator. 

I would have a great deal of difficulty with it, Senator.

It is accurate as far as it goes, but it leaves a misleading impression that one can do the job of an Associate Justice in 6 hours a day. That cannot be done, and the practice I developed was because I did find it very good for me physically to get a swim in in the afternoon, was to work at home in the evening, as all of the Justices of our Court, of course, did that before they moved into the new Court building in 1935.And I put in a good number of hours at home. There is a—well, I should not be explaining to you what the life of a Chief Justice is since you have been one and I have not. But as you know, part of the work of any appellate judge is working with law clerks, working with one's colleagues, sitting on the bench hearing arguments, going to conferences.But there is a fair amount of the work that you have to do by yourself. The staffers cannot help you, the law clerks cannot help you. You have to read briefs. You have to read circulating drafts of opinions. You have to read either petitions for certiorari or memos summarizing. And that is work that not only can be just as well done at home, I have found, but better done at home when you are not interrupted the way you are in your office.

Yes; I do. 

I do not believe so, Senator. I am, of course, aware of the fact that the Associate Justice's role is pretty well deciding the business that comes before the Court. The Chief Justice has a good deal more extensive responsibilities that would involve seeing more people, just as you point out, working with groups completely outside the Court. And whereas I certainly do not propose to give up my fairly regular swimming, which I think is essential to feeling fit, obviously I am going to have to tailor and remodel a lot of the way I handle the job of Associate Justice and simply spend more time in the building. There is no question.

Yes, I do, Senator. I certainly would not have accepted the nomination had I thought otherwise.

Senator, I would say that in my mind the jury is out on whether a court that big will ever work. I think no one has labored more indefatigably to see that it did than Chief Judge Browning, and I think he is a real student of judicial administration, and Judge Wallace along with him, as you mentioned.I do not know how you could get a better production out of that situation than they have done. Whether or not it ultimately will work, I certainly do not profess to know. I think the judges of the ninth circuit and people attending the ninth circuit conference say they believe it is working. And since we have so many problems with court of appeals, conflicts of circuits and that sort of thing, I think one of Judge Browning's arguments in favor of keeping the ninth circuit the way it is, as I understand it, is that if you split the circuit, that is just one more court that is going to furnish conflicts that need to be resolved, either by the Supreme Court or the National Court of Appeals.So, I would definitely feel that—and I daresay the judges of the ninth circuit feel that way—certainly it should be observed; but if they can do it successfully, more power to them.

I think I started wearing glasses off and on, you know, sometime in probably—I think maybe grade school, perhaps high school.

I switched, as I recall, from wearing glasses part of the time to all the time right after I moved to Phoenix in 1953, more or less out of pride. I had not wanted to wear glasses because I obviously thought I looked better without them. But then I moved to a new city where my wife and I knew only one other person at the time we moved there, and the idea if you are going to be successful and get around and meet people. And I realized I was meeting people and then snubbing them on the streets the next day. [Laughter.]That is when I started wearing glasses all the time. 

I recall one case, and I am not sure you would describe it as laches. It was a case called United States against Nevada that was about 3 or 4 years ago. And it was a question of the Government being prevented from opening up a decree that had been entered in a district court proceeding out in Nevada, oh, in the 1940's, I think. I do not know whether, thinking back, I cannot remember whether it turned on laches or not, but that is as close as anything I remember. 

He wrote another memo on the same case, I know from now reviewing the Jackson memos. I cannot say whether it was earlier or later.301 

I think Justice Jackson did. 

It certainly happened in some cases, Senator. 

Oh, I see now that it was. I do not know that I would have remembered it just from reading my memo by itself. 

He said that. I believe that he is correct in saying that for the reasons that I said in my 1971 letter to Senator Eastland. His statement that it embodied a lot of his views, I cannot recall at this time whether it did or not. 

It is certainly consistent with my recollection. 

I did not think it was, no. 

Oh, certainly not. 

Yes; it is, Senator.

Yes; it is. 

Yes; I did. 

Yes; I think it is. 

There certainly are. I cannot vouch for the exact number. 

Yes; it was interpreting an act of Congress, and the question was whether or not the exemption was to be denied. And I would add in supplementing what you have already said that, in my opinion in that case, I specifically rejected the constitutional argument advanced by Bob Jones.

Yes. 

Well, no question of that. 

I think that is clear from what I wrote at that time. 

Yes, they did. 

Not at all, Senator. 

Yes, I wrote Mueller against Allen. 

Yes. Of course, Wallace against Jaffrey came after Mueller against Allen, but certainly there are very definitely common threads in the reasoning of them. 

That the first amendment does not forbid any of the Nation's long-standing religious traditions? 

Similar to the creche perhaps? 

I would not want to speak for any of my colleagues on that, Senator. These cases, although in theory they are very logical and analytical, often tend to turn on the facts very much. Certainly if something were identical to the creche or very close to it, I would think we would get the same five to four division that we did in that case. 

We are all extremists together then. [Laughter.] 

It is hard to put oneself back in that time, Senator, but I am not sure how I would have thought about that. It is a noble sentiment, nobly expressed. Having seen the cases that have come before us recently where, for instance, there have been efforts by student governments to recognize the fact that parochial schools do a great deal of the education of people and take burdens off public schools, in an effort to somehow recompense that by allowing, for example, tuition credits to parents whose children attend parochial schools, and I am not sure that I—with the benefit of hindsight—I would completely agree that there should be a wall of separation between church and state of the kind that would prohibit that sort of aid. 

Certainly any effort to coerce religious minorities to conform, I think, is a definite problem. 

Senator Metzenbaum, if you look more thoroughly at the memo that you are talking about, which I believe was in one of my memos in Terry against Adams, it starts out with the statement—and it is signed by me, WHR; it is to Justice Jackson—if you are going to dissent, I should think you might combine the ideas which you expressed last week with an attack on the reasoning of the two quote majority opinions, close quote.And then No. 1 below that is Justice Black, it says Black. No. 2 is FF, which certainly stood for Felix Frankfurter, and then, No. 3, your ideas, dash, dash, the Constitution does not prevent the majority from banding together, nor does it taint success in the effort. It is about time the Court faced the factSo that I think the memo read in context gives a somewhat different impression. Though I certainly shared the view at that time that in order for something to be unconstitutional it had to involve State action; and I continue to share that view, and I think it remains the law.

On the law of the matter, yes. 

Unless you want it, Mr. Chairman, or Senator Metzenbaum does, I do not have any particular need for it. 

I think it would have been much more accurate to say, unlawful discrimination. Because there was obviously blatant discrimination in that case, just as you put it. I think what I meant was that a desire which overbore every other consideration of law to find State action where there might have been very good reasons for thinking it was a purely private act. 

The memo certainly is subject to being fairly interpreted that way. But I think a more accurate statement of my views would be that the idea that the overriding element was the effort to bring everything within the rubric of State action, even though perhaps it could not justifiably be done. 

I think it probably was. 

At that time I was, Senator; yes. 

Yes, I have. 

Well, there have been cases in which I certainly voted to enforce antidiscrimination ordinances, statutes passed by Congress. There was a case, I think Tillman v. Wheatenhaven, that came up shortly after I went on the Court, where I think the opinion of the Court was unanimous, saying that Congress had prohibited discrimination—there was an exception for private clubs, and saying that particular outfit was not a private club. And I joined what I think was an unanimous opinion. 

Either he or I, and it may well have been me, had picked the wrong space for the name to be printed. And I think actually my name should have been printed or typed in the first—or perhaps below it. But at any rate, he signed where I should have signed. He also signed as a notary. And then we crossed out his name and put my signature in above it. 

I thought it was a matter of form, Senator. Because, as you say, I had just made the oath.

If Congress would welcome such an address, I should think any Chief Justice, including me, if I am confirmed, would be delighted to have the opportunity to tell Congress some of the problems, some of the current situations, in the judiciary. It is a very significant occasion when a joint session of Congress is convened. And there might be a feeling, I suppose, that only a President or something like that should get that degree of dignity. 

If I had heard only what you said, Senator, I would have the gravest doubt. But I think if, again, there is a full sentence there which qualifies it. And it was in a context not of an effort to integrate the schools as such, because the schools in Phoenix have never been segregated by law except, I believe, for a high school system. Do you have before you the full sentence, because I am not sure that I do? 

If I were being elevated to the Court for the first time, and yet somehow had the foresight that enabled me to see how I would vote for the next 15 years, I would say, I think, if I were a member of a minority, and not being a member of any minority it is very difficult for me to put myself in that position, but this person reads the Constitutional clauses upon which many of the lawsuits which would benefit minorities are based, more narrowly than some of the other people. I wish someone with a more expansive idea of the equal protection clause would be appointed.But since I am already on the Court, and am simply being promoted to Chief Justice as opposed to Associate Justice, I would not think there is any reason to think that the way I see things for the next however many years it is I am permitted to serve if confirmed, would change from the way I have been doing it for the last 15 years.

I believe it is, Senator. 

Senator, I was reluctantly willing to answer your questions about the first amendment questions. I am a good deal more reluctant to venture an answer that would be any sort of a broader classification. In effect, I must say I am very much inclined to think that I best ought not. 

Well, the difficulty with the question and the difficulty with my answering it, Senator, is that it is a totally abstract question as you propose it and as I would have to answer it. We do not know what context it comes up in. I have not had a chance to read whatever the framers might have said in connection with the article III, section 2, with such exceptions that Congress may provide. It just gets us into an area that may come before the Court and that frankly is the kind that previous nominees, I think, have not answered. 

I said in my—I do not know whether I said in 19—what was it, 59—that it was appropriate for the nominee to respond. I know I said it was appropriate for Congress to inquire. But I was asked a similar question in my 1971 hearing, and I think I made the statement that I had no doubt at all that it was appropriate for Congress to inquire and to find out in every way, but that I had no idea of the extraordinary difficulties that that approach put the nominee in. If I were coming before you as someone from private life without any record of participating and deciding cases, perhaps that is the only way you can get at it. But I have 15 years of decisions that should give an adequate indication, I would think, of my judicial philosophy to the extent I have one. 

I really did not go into in 1959 what the nominee's responsibility was. And I really had no idea what the problems confronting a nominee were then.

Well, I think I can, Senator. The questions can be directed to sources and places other than the nominee. And I think Justice Frankfurter took that position when he came before the committee, that his philosophy was a very legitimate inquiry, but he had written lots of things, and he was not going to answer any questions about it.

Senator, I am sure it goes without saying that I respect your position. I think I understand your problem, and I hope that you understand mine too, that this is, as you say, there have been bills pending. I do not know what the contents of the bills were, but if we get away from the very rock bottom thing that we were talking about earlier to a different kind of bill, I simply think that I would be expressing an opinion on something that might come before the Court.

But, Senator, I believe in those situations, the expressions had taken place when the people were not Justices and had not been nominated. They were then in some other function. And I think that is quite a difference.

Senator, with all respect, I think I disagree with you. I think it would be one thing for me to get up in the Senate, if I were a Senator, and to say I think the proposed Court stripping bill is wholly unconstitutional, and then later vote on that case if I had been appointed to the Supreme Court in the meantime. But I do not think that is the same situation if someone who is a sitting Justice at the time the question is asked is nominated to be Chief Justice and asked please express your opinion on this case, that concedingly might come before you.

Well, I naturally regret that she feels the way she does. I have given the committee the best explanation, the best reconstruction I can of that memo, some first in 1971 when it was 25 years old, and now in 1986 when it is 34 years old.

NO, I do not think they do. 

Yes. Obviously something for him to say. 

NO more than that. 

I think that is correct. 

Perhaps I can amplify a little bit. If their intent were to prevent the newly-freed blacks from being subject to black code, they could have drafted a fairly specific provision, saying that this kind of thing is prohibited. They did not. They used quite general language, saying no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without beep, beep, or no State shall deprive any person of the equal protection of the laws. And so I think you have a situation at which they were aiming, which was the specific one, and yet they used general language to cover—and the fact they used general language makes one think that they certainly wanted to cover the evil at which they were aiming, but also other evils that might be similar to it.

I think so. 

Yes. I think it is actually—I think the person claiming the right in Craig against Boren was not a woman but a man. It was I think Oklahoma. I think it was perhaps when Senator Boren was the Governor, had passed a statute saying that women could, I think, buy liquor or buy beer at age 18, but men could not until they were 21. And there was a man who was 19 or 20 who said that is a denial of the equal protection of the laws, to treat men differently from women. And I think the position I took there was that, just like a legislature is going to have to distinguish between, you know, optometrists, opticians, any number of other similarly situated people in regulating that sort of a thing, a legislature ought to be able to make reasonable judgments about whether, perhaps because the men do the driving or did the driving or something like that at the time the statute was passed, there was a reason for putting down different age limits and restricting men more than women. 

Well, our cases are—there is disagreement among the members of the present Court on some of the standards to be applied in equal protection. I think we all agree that any classification based on race is suspect, and that only what is called a compelling State interest would justify it. And I think even if there were 

Well, that is kind of embarrassing because the phrase was used in an opinion, I think, about 25 or 30 years ago, and it has been picked up in subsequent opinions. It is not out of the Constitution, but it is kind of a shorthand form, as I understand it, of saying the kind of justification you would have to ad-vance, or a law that treats blacks in any way differently from whites or Asians or, you know, any sort of racial discrimination.And the Court has never gone so far as to say there are no circumstances in which that can happen, and I think the recent minority hiring cases, of course, talk about compelling circumstances that justify in some circumstances giving preferential hiring.

NO. I think the prevailing standard now for women is what is called intermediate scrutiny.

Senator, it is not simply my rationale. But I think our 

Well, I am trying to think if I have covered that in anything I have written. 

Well, what case? 

NO. That is 

That is a mistake, Senator. And if you will come back to that, I can give it

May I expand on my answer? 

The 14th amendment, the equal protection clause, by its term, applies to all persons. That is any person under the sun. So the question is what standards do you use in judging the claim of a person under that amendment? And the strict scrutiny standard or the compelling State interest standard that we talked about earlier, is the one that you use for judging claims advanced by blacks and similarly situated people. 

I think we have—I know the Court has applied it to Chinese, Chinese-Americans in the Yic Wo case. Then the question becomes, when a woman is advancing that claim on the basis of a law which distinguishes between men and women, does the woman or the man, for that matter, get the benefit of that sort of a standard, that very strict standard? And I think the response, and this has been mine, but also the other members of the Court, we do not agree entirely but we will both respond this way, no, discrimination between men and women is not to be treated the same as be it discrimination between blacks and whites. Women and men are virtually equal in our population. And much of the traditional discrimination against women by virtue of labor laws and so forth, while very unfair to them, nonetheless, does not have the—there are many situations in which distinctions between men and women are not genuinely invidious in the way that—it is not felt that it was the same to say, for example, that we do not hire blacks for heavy labor, which is a violently offensive thing, or to say we do not hire women for heavy labor. One may be as wrong as the other, but there is not the same invidious context. 

Senator, is your question directed to the standard of review under the equal protection clause?

The explanation I just gave you a moment ago is the best one I can think of.

NO. I do not think anyone for a moment would contend that the people who drafted the 14th amendment in the Congress in 1868 intended to have a very wide ranging prohibition in that clause as to discrimination between men and women.

Senator, with all respect, I think you confuse the people to whom the amendment applies, which is everyone, every single person is covered by the language person in the equal protection clause. 

The question is when a person makes a claim, saying I am a person, and further describes themselves as black, female, Oriental, whatever, what standard do we use to decide whether their claim states a violation of the equal protection clause? 

Well, the clause is no State shall deprive any person of equal protection of the laws. That is all there is to it, 10 words. 

There is obviously no standard there and no varying standard. Yet, the Court has come up with varying standards and has adhered to them. 

I was not sure it was a question. [Laughter.] 

Yes, I did, Senator. 

There are a number of cases where a Federal statute is construed one way by one court of appeals and another way by another. My colleague, Justice White, is the most determined advocate of this view, that there ought not to be those sort of different readings on any important question of law. In effect, the Internal Revenue Code ought to not to mean one thing in South Carolina and another thing in South Dakota. I think it is very hard to argue that position when you're dealing with a statute that's been enacted by Congress, presumably because Congress wanted a uniform interpretation. There are a number of those cases every year that we do not review because there seemed to a sufficient number of Justices to be more pressing issues that need to be reviewed. But I think all of us would agree that if there were adequate national decisionmaking capacity, those conflicts ought to be settled. 

Yes, it is. 

Yes. We have, for instance, constitutional decisions. I can't be any more specific than that, just because none occur to me right now, coming from all of the 13 Federal Courts of Appeals, and petitions coming from 50 of the State courts. Now, some of them are not significant questions, but some of them are significant. I also have the view that any constitutional decision has a significance all its own, by whatever court made. So I think with due regard for the limits of the court on the number of cases it can decide, I have felt that cases like that, perhaps, were—should have a higher priority than a simple statutory conflict. 

If you mean by a civil liberties claim, Senator, a claim in which the, say, criminal defendant is raising a con-345 stitutional defense to his sentence or trial, that has been sustained by the lower court, I think that's an accurate statement

It's an accurate statement. Because in reading some lower court decisions that come to us on petition for certiorari, I occasionally get the sense that some of their decisions don't conform to the constitutional law in the area that our Court has laid down. 

If the State court decided a Federal question, probably yes. 

Yes. 

Justice Jackson. 

I think so. 

I don't have it immediately before me, Senator, but that conforms to my recollection. 

I have no recollection of this memo or any other memo, except to note they were typed by me. Certainly, the memo makes it appear that he was contemplating a dissent at that time. 

NO; not at all. 

Yes; it has. 

I could say I believe it has. I would have to know more about my colleagues 

I believe you are, Senator. 

AS I recall, it was. 

I can't answer now as to what Mr. Justice Jackson's original view was. I think the memo indicates that that was his view.

Yes. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

AS to approving of the Brown ruling, I think Brown might have been argued but I don't believe it had come down. I think this was 

Oh, sure. The 14th amendment prohibited discrimination. 

Reconstructing from this memo, I would certainly say so. 

Yes; I think it is, Senator. 

Yes; that is absolutely correct. 

Yes; it is. 

Yes; and for a lot longer than that. 

I think it is. 

I didn't hear it in what you read. 

I think that's your addition, isn't it, Senator? I mean, did I say that? 

That the nominee ought to respond? 

It's funny, I don't have a—that is what I said at that time? 

Well, certainly, that is the fair import of the statement, just as you say. I don't think I appreciated, at the time I wrote that, the difficult position that the nominee is in. If you will read over some of these other confirmation hearings, I think you will see that other nominees have felt just as I have about the sort of question that you want me to answer.

Well, perhaps the distinction isn't as clear as I would like it to be, but I think there is some distinction. The Court has often referred to the first amendment as the preferred freedom, the indispensable matrix of a democratic society. I think that really is the guts, probably the thing that is the necessary prerequisite for effective democratic government.As important as many of the other constitutional guarantees are, I don't think they have quite that same importance in that context.

When you say—you mean that I, as a Justice, might possibly vote that that was a proper congressional action?

Senator, I don't believe I can answer that question. It would depend on briefs, arguments, and the like. The nominees before this committee have been, I think, quite steadfast in refusing to answer a question, which I believe from your question, you say bills have been pending in Congress to do that. 

Senator, it is not that I have a question about it. It is the idea that, as you posit it, it is based on pending legislation in the Congress that could well come before the Court.350 I think the precedents of many nominees before me foreclose me from answering. 

Other than the point I made yesterday. It, obviously, incorporates freedom of speech. I took the position in a couple of opinions I wrote in following Justice Jackson and Justice Harlan that some of the details might be different as applied against the States as opposed to the Federal Government. 

NO; I think that is settled by the Everson case. 

I do not think so. 

Yes; I think they are. 

That was held in Mapp v. Ohio. 

It is certainly a settled matter, yes. 

I think that was in the—Senator, I am going to draw back a little. Because in a case like Benton v. Maryland that came to the Court where—before I got there. I did not participate in that case. I have followed Benton v. Maryland many timeswhen I have been on the Court. But to say whether I agree with a case that was decided before I came on the Court, I think it is better to phrase it that my record in voting on the case has certainly shown that I have followed that case.

I think in a case—I cannot remember—a case coming up from Montana, I took the—Justice Stewart joined my opinion, I joined Justice Stewart's opinion—saying that some of the nuances of the double jeopardy clause should not apply the same to the States as to the Federal Government.I think this was a case involving when the trial started, for the purposes of—when jeopardy attached. And the rule in the Federal cases was when a witness is first sworn. But Montana had a wholly different procedure. And it just seemed that a fair translation of the Federal rule to the State rule would not give you an identical situation.

NO; I think I am OK, Senator. Thank you. 

Sir, I remember giving a speech. I do not doubt that that is in it. I do not recall that offhand. 

Yes, I think that is correct. 

Yic Wo. 

1885,1 think. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I think maybe, Frontiero, yeah. 

And I think Craig v. Boren. 

It may be that some other members of the Court did. The full suspect classification, compelling state interests rule. I am not sure of that. 

In Craig, yes. 

I think in the Hogan case—I am not sure of this, but I think in the Hogan v. Mississippi case some 3 or 4 years ago I was in dissent. But I have a feeling either my opinion or the opinion I joined suggested that there was a higher standard than simply pure rational basis. I am not certain of that. 

Well, the sex discrimination cases had been before the Court for a long period of time. And it was treated strictly as rational basis. I think up until the time of Reed v. Reed, in about 1971. And there, without naming any level of scrutiny, as the cases say, the Court struck down a statute that discriminated between men and women. And in the intervening time, I think the Court and various Justices have taken different positions, is just trying to settle in on a standard that will govern discrimination between men and women. A plurality, as you point out, in Frontiero, had said this is just like discrimination against blacks. But then members of that plurality settle back in Craig v. Boren for a more middle-level thing. Whereas I had said in Craig I thought rational basis applied, I think in at least one case I have written or joined since then, I have intimated that something more perhaps than rational basis 

Well, Senator, much depends on what you mean by a living breathing document.If you mean that 

Again, it depends on what you mean by a living Constitution. 

Well, I cannot put the speech right back in my mind, but perhaps I can tell you now

Well, and again, speaking in generalities, when you are dealing with something like the equal protection clause, which I think is a good example, it came about because of particular evils that were inflicted on newly freed blacks after the Civil War.But Congress, in attempting to protect these people constitutionally, used very, very general language. No person shall be denied equal protection of the laws.And it is fair to believe that that should be, for that reason, extended to people other than the particular group who was to benefit from it and who may have been the cause of the amendment into a principle of law that applies to, very broadly speaking, similarly situated people.The fact that there may be things that would be covered by the fair meaning of the equal protection clause, practices that were never started or had never occurred in 1868 certainly is not a reason, I think, for not applying the equal protection clause.

NO question about it. 

I would not say wholly right. But there is certainly something to what you say. If you are talking about people who go beyond the positions I have taken, and simply say that everything that bothers them should be a suspect classification. I do not suggest that any of my colleagues have taken that position. There, I think you would haTe an example of simply—of fitting the equal protection clause to reject your own personal dislikes or institutional factors that you dislike. 

NO, it is not based on dislike. 

NO, I am not sure I agree with you, Senator. You know, you cannot get away from your philosophy, or whatever, as judge. But I think a judge should make a conscious effort not to simply bring his own philosophies. 

Yes, I think that is settled law, and my opinions reflect it. 

Again, my opinions reflect the fact. 

I think certainly precedents to be followed under the standards I earlier indicated, to which you referred.Now, I think it is unsettling, also, to the—sometimes to the country, if it is a big enough situation, but always to the profession and to courts who have to apply the case, to have a case overruled. And cases have been overruled, there is no question.But I think as an institutional matter, the Chief Justice, probably has something of an interest in seeing that there is stability in the law.

I have not been over every one of them, Senator. If there was a particular issue that I felt very deeply, after having reviewed the majority opinion and my own, and it was a constitutional issue, I certainly might feel obligated under my oath as Chief Justice to continue to vote for that position.But unless it were of that stature, I certainly would feel the other way.

I simply cannot recall at this stage, Senator. 

I simply cannot recall at this time. 

If the memo you are referring to is the Terry v. Adams one that we discussed earlier, that may have been a paraphrase. It did not purport to be a literal transcription of what Justice Jackson had told me of his ideas. But it certainly was a reflection of them, and an accurate reflection of them I would have thought. Certainly not necessarily and precisely the language.

A year and a half. 

That white people in the South did not like black people? 

I simply cannot remember. 

Senator, I was asked about that, I believe by Senator Hatch, afterward, and he pointed out that after the words, leading to a segregated society nor to an integrated—but to a free society in which each person is equal under the law. And then there is another phrase added which I cannot remember. 

Yes. 

There is no question those were my views at the time. 

I think generally it is more dedicated to an integrated society than to a segregated society, where you are talking about any sort of legal action or any sort of government-sponsored activity. 

Certainly phrased the way you do, yes, I would be. But I think the statement was also made in the context of a proposal for fairly extensive busing of kids that would have pretty well torn up the neighborhood school system.

I do not think it is, Senator. I think it was the idea that some of the blacks would not have wanted their children bused. 

Well, Senator, one of the superintendent's proposal, I think, to which I was objecting—again, it is 20 years ago—was one in which he said that busing was a possibility, or he would not rule out busing. 

I think the Chief Justice joined in that. 

Senator, I set forth my reasons in my opinion. I realize you disagree with them, but I do not think I should be in the position of defending it any further than what I stated there.

I do not believe I should expand on it, Senator, for the reason I said, but I would add that what I said was the law laid down by the majority of the Supreme Court in a case called Swain v. Alabama, in 1966, when some of my present colleagues were on the Court and voted that, voted that way. So, it was no novel idea on my part. The rest of the Court decided to overrule that case. I did not feel it should be overruled.

Senator, I am not sure I am—I think I might be disqualified to answer, because I have been suffering for 15 years from exactly the same problem. In that period of time I have had the meteroric rise in seniority from ninth to seventh, which is still very junior in our institution. 

Yes. I do. 

I think one tries to analyze what the situation of the people are that are making the claim. Whether it is most like the blacks, who are the victims of slavery and discrimination, at the time the 14th amendment was adopted, or, whether they are a group that has a pretty full access to society, no question of right to vote, how big a fraction of society are they—that sort of thing. 

I think it was. I am 

Yes. I believe it is. 

I believe that is correct, yes, saying that the nursing school could limit its enrollment to women only under the circumstances of that case. 

I think in Kirchberg against Feenstra if I recall, I think I did, and I think one of the Weinberger cases. There were a number of them. I cannot remember which ones.

Senator, this is something like one of the questions that came up with Senator Specter, I think, whether it is one thing as to whether my, the opinions I have written while on the Court subscribe to the view in the one man, one vote case. In Mann against Howell I certainly did subscribe to it.But to go back to a time when I was not on the Court, and say, as a judge, how would you have voted then, I think perhaps only someone who has been a judge realizes the difference between hearing the holding of a case and saying, "Well, that sounds all right to me," or, no, it does not, and the act of going through, reading the briefs, hearing the arguments, discussing the case in conference. You cannot substitute for that experience.

If you ask me whether I subscribe to the principle now—as I said, in Mann against Howell, which I wrote for the Court, there is no question that that principle—I thought you meant put yourself back as if you were a Justice

I do not think I can answer that. 

Yes, there have been. 

I am not sure that I have because I have had some difficulty with it, and the most recent decision of our Court, in that case, the Hardwick case, declined to accept, to extend the principle to the right to practice homosexual sodomy. There may have been cases in which I have subscribed to that, but I have been somewhat at odds with some of the members of the Court on it, and so I am hesitant to say yes. 

I think I understand you. I think the voter watch program, as conceived, to have Republican poll watchers in all of the precincts, and to have some sort of a test, according to the statute, as to whether or not they resided where they said they resided, was entirely sensible, and in accordance with law. And I think there is nothing to apologize about it, for at all.I think the provision allowing challenge for literacy was one that very readily lent itself to abuse, was outlawed in 1964, and I think that one would be better left undone.

I think the challenges for literacy, even though they were authorized by the statute, looking back with the benefit of hindsight, there were abuses on the part of our poll watchers. 

On the present Court? 

On the conservative side. [Laughter.] Using that term for want of a better one. 

Again, using that term for want of a better one, I think the Chief and I are probably the most conservative, and it may be that I am moreso than he. I am just not sure. This is, I mean, on the basis of our opinions, not on the basis of our 

Yes. 

OK. 

That was one of them, yes. 

I do not think it is entirely correct to say that in that case. It was two different versions of double jeopardy: one which seemed to make sense at the time it was written, and then, because of other intervening decisions of the Court, it just made a good deal less sense by the time we got to Scott

Certainly. Not different versions of the amendment but different cases taking different positions, interpreting.

Senator Byrd, I think the goal would be in the field of judicial administration rather than just the work of the Supreme Court. And it would be to try to persuade Congress and the country that we do need what has been referred to as an intercircuit tribunal, or a National Court of Appeals to operate as kind of a Junior Chamber of the Supreme Court because of the increased caseloads in all the other courts.I know there have been proposals submitted to the Congress for that. But they have not really gotten the necessary number of votes to be enacted into law. And I would hope by working with the Judiciary Committee in the Senate and the Judiciary Committee in the House, and by doing whatever else I can to assist those committees and getting some support in the ranks of the profession, to get such a court created.

Senator, I would. As you know, the bills that are pending do not take that position. I think perhaps with an eye to appeal to the Congress on the ground of economy, they contemplate using existing circuit judges, and simply having a rotating panel that would sit part of the year in Washington to decide those cases.But there have been very real difficulties raised, I think, with the manner in which judges to that sort of a court would be appointed. And so I think I would favor, if Congress would accept the idea, the idea of a really new court, called it what it is, with new judges to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

Let me say first, Senator, that if Congress should feel that the Court could only be created under one of the existing proposals, I would cheerfully abandon what seemed to me some objections to those. But the objections do not come from me; they come from other segments of the profession and other judges.There are two existing proposals, as you know, for staffing or picking the judges of the new court of appeals under the existing bill. One would be that they be picked by the Chief Justice of theUnited States. And I am loath to subscribe to that because I think it would give the Chief Justice too much power over the composition of the court.Another proposal is that the judges be elected by each of the various circuit counsels and the regional courts of appeals that now sit in the country. I have some reservation about that because, as I answered one earlier question, I believe, I think it would tend to make the new court a little bit like the United Nations with the judges named to it having loyalty primarily to the court of appeals from whence they came rather than to the new court. And that is why I think it should be appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate.

Yes, I suppose they would be. 

I think I see your point, Senator. I think that some thought has been given to it, and it was thought, I believe, that there was a precedent for it in the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals which sat during the Second World War, and which sits now, where the judges held judicial office in a regular court and were appointed to this rather temporary court.But I realize, as you suggest, that if the court were not temporary, then you would really have a problem under the officers of the U.S. court.

They have manifested, the majority of them who have spoken out on it have manifested, I think, disagreement with the idea.

I am familiar with it in the sense—was that the first book he wrote?

I think I am familiar with it. I have not read it from cover to cover. I think I have read parts of it.

Yes; I think very much so. 

I, certainly, recall him sending me some tough questions. This far back in time, it is hard to pick out any one thing.But the most difficult thing about many of the questions we used to get from the White House in the Office of Legal Counsel was not the inherent difficulty of the question. They were questions that any good lawyer could have answered in 2 weeks or maybe 1 week. But the difficulty was the White House would call at 10 and want an answer at 2 in the afternoon. And that was what posed the difficulty, because the questions often had some substance to them. And it took a real determined effort plus a bit of the seat of the pants instinct to get the work out.

Well, I think the side of the things sent to me was generally the legal side of the thing. The question would have political implications.Just to take a hypothetical example: Can the President do such and such under such and such?Now, the question if the President could legally do it, he would go ahead and do it, would be a political question. That was not the kind of thing that was submitted to me.But a lot of the political decisions that the President was considering had legal implications.

I think they were mixed issues of law and politics, but I would be surprised at the White House, with all of the political operatives over there, sending to the Office of Legal Counsel something that they wanted a political decision on.

I am sure that was possible. 

I recall something involving a question where—I think it was a Governor, I cannot think of his name—a Republican Governor who was pressing to have some sort of a—I cannot even remember what it was now, but it was sent over to us with the idea, is what the Governor asking lawful? Could we do it if we wanted to? But there was never any suggestion that the Office of Legal Counsel simply ought to give a legal opinion because the president wanted to do the thing politically, or because somebody in the White House wanted to do something politically. 

Many of them were just over the phone; some of them were formal opinions; some of them may have been letters.

Yes; I think we rendered written opinions over my signature, to departments, and things like that. 

I am sure some of them were in writing and some oral. 

I cannot think of any instance, Senator, in which I ever refused to answer a question. I may have said that I could not render a satisfactory opinion in the time given, or, perhaps the opinion I rendered was not the one that the people over there wanted. I cannot imagine myself flatly refusing to answer a question. 

NO, I do not; Senator. 

I do not recall any but it has been a while. I would not say there were not any.

NO; I cannot. 

Not with leaks or investigations. I was chairman of a committee to look into the classification of materials as secret, and that sort of thing. And whether some part of that work might have dealt with leaks, I am just not sure. It was the same general area, certainly. 

I cannot recall any, Senator, but I cannot say that there were not any. 

I do not recall their having come to me one way or the other, Senator, but certainly, if they had come, it could have been either oral or written. 

It could have happened in any one of those three ways, Senator. 

I certainly remember meetings to discuss legal questions with Mr. Ehrlichman, and I recall talking to him on the phone, and I am sure I probably sent him letters. 

Well, I—excuse me. The original would have been sent to him, and I do not know where that would be, and I presume a copy of the letter would be kept somewhere in the Justice Department files. 

Obviously, I do not know what he was talking about. I could perhaps give some idea about what I think those words might have meant on this part.I think it was what any good lawyer does for a client. The client does not want to hear no, no, no. If the client's proposal is, has some legal problem with it, the good lawyer tries to figure out what the client's objective is, and find a lawful way to accomplish the objective. And I think perhaps that is what he is referring to. It was not simply a situation of sending back a letter saying, no, your plan is not authorized under the statute. It would be sending back a hypothetical letter, saying:You cannot proceed under the statute as you thought you could, but perhaps if you take a look at another section of the statute and change your plan a little, it might comply with that section of the statute.

Well, those are very general words, Senator. I have offered one explanation of what I thought he might mean by them. I do not know that I can offer much else. 

Only the qualification, Senator, that I think I mentioned earlier, that I would not have used the term, in describing the things that the White House, in Mr. Ehrlichman's testimony, as mixed questions of law and politics. I would describe the questions in the White House as that, but it seems to me that it was the legal implications of those questions, and those only, that were sent to us. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator Hatch. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

"I am sure he is mistaken." Now, he is talking about Dr. Smith. "It is perfectly possible that I could have arrived at a southwest Phoenix polling place." Now, Smith is talking about either 1960 or 1962, in a southwest Phoenix polling place.REHNQUIST. "It is perfectly possible that I could have arrived at a southwest Phoenix polling place with a couple of other people, and again, I gather he is not definite as to the years, because one of my jobs as notice reading what I said in 1971, and recalling as best I can now, was to go to polling places where our challenger was not allowed into the polling place or if a dispute came up as to something similar to that, either I or along with my Democratic counterpart would go."So it is not at all inconceivable that I would have been with a group of two or three other people going to a southwest Phoenix polling place in whatever year that was."The clear impression that Mr. Rehnquist is trying to give—not his impression; that is his testimony—that that was his kind of function. He was whatever you call a ''notice reader." I do not know whether there is such a function.Mr. BROSNAHAN. I do not know. 

AS to the first part, Senator, if he saw, he certainly could have seen me giving instructions to challengers in a polling place. As to the second part, would you read that again?

I have no recollection of that, no.Now, was Justice Rehnquist wrong? Mr. MIRKIN. I do not know whether he is wrong about what he remembers or not. I remember something else having happened. And what I remember is what I told you today. 

I am sure he is mistaken as to the latter part. It is perfectly possible that I could have arrived at a southwest Phoenix polling booth with a couple of other people. And, again, I gather, he is not definite as to the years, because one of my jobs is notice reading. What I said in 1971, and recalling as best I can now, was to go to the polling places where our challenger was not allowed into the polling place, or if a dispute came up as to something similar to that, either I, or along with my Democratic counterpart would go. So, it is not at all inconceivable that I would have been with a group or two or three other people going to a southwest Phoenix polling place, in whatever year that was, but the latter part is false.

Senator, let me beg to differ with you on that point, if I may. I thought your question was challenging. Now you say harassing or intimidating. As to harassing or intimidating, I certainly do categorically deny any time, any place.Would you characterize the activities that you saw at that polling place as harassing or intimidating voters from participating in voting?Dr. SMITH. Well, that is what it certainly looked like to me. 

I think it was simply watching the vote being counted. 

A challenger, Senator, was someone who was authorized by law to go to the polling place. Frequently, the function was not to challenge but simply to watch the poll, watch the vote being counted. Well, that is fine. As I understand your testimony, you said you were a poll watcher. The challenger has a different connotation. Justice REHNQUIST. TO be a poll watcher at that time, I think you had to be a challenger.Well, here we go around in semantics, which we have found the Justice very capable of doing. In the Laird-Tatum case we found that possible. We found it in terms of the Jackson memorandums, and we found it in terms of response to these questions.But as I understand your testimony here today, is that you positively identified Rehnquist as being there, and you positively identified him doing the kinds of activities of requiring the voters to read from a card, and that you observed voters who were subject to that kind of activity leaving the line.And that you are here today, really, in response to your children's belief that this is a patriotic duty. That at a time of conflicting testimony, that you have a positive citizen's responsibility tospeak to this Judiciary Committee, and to the American people, to tell them—Dr. SMITH. Yes.
