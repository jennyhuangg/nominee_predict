Senator Leahy, yesterday many of the Senators emphasized their—the values they thought were important for judging, and central to many of their comments was the fact that a judge had to come to the process understanding the importance and respect the Constitution must receive in the judging process and an understanding that that respect is guided by and should be guided by a full appreciation of the limited jurisdiction of the Court in our system of Government, but understanding its importance as well. That is the central part of judging.What my experience on the trial court and the appellate court have reinforced for me is that the process of judging is a process of keeping an open mind. It’s the process of not coming to a decision with a prejudgment ever of an outcome, and that reaching a conclusion has to start with understanding what the parties are arguing, but examining in all situations carefully the facts as they prove them or not prove them, the record as they create it, and then making a decision that is limited to what the law says on the facts before the judge.

I became a lawyer in the prosecutor’s office. To this day, I owe who I have become as—who I became as a lawyer and who I have become as judge to Mr. Morgenthau. He gaveme a privilege and honor in working in his office that has shaped my life.When I say I became a lawyer in his office, it’s because in law school, law schools teach you in hypotheticals. They set forth facts for you. They give you a little bit of teaching on how those facts are developed, but not a whole lot. And then they ask you to opine about legal theory and apply legal theory to the facts before you.Well, when you work in a prosecutor’s office, you understand that the law is not legal theory. It’s facts. It’s what witnesses say and don’t say. It’s how you develop your position in the record. And then it’s taking those facts and making arguments based on the law as it exists. That’s what I took with me as a trial judge. It’s what I take with me as an appellate judge. It is respect that each case gets decided case by case, applying the law as it exists to the facts before you.You asked me a second question about the Tarzan murderer case, and that case brought to life for me, in a way that perhaps no other case had fully done before, the tragic consequences of needless death. In that case, Mr. Maddicks was dubbed ‘‘the Tarzan murderer’’ by the press because he used acrobatic feats to gain entry into apartments. In one case, he took a rope, placed it on a pipe on top of a roof, put a paint can at the other end, and threw it into a window in a building below, and broke the window. He then swung himself into the apartment and on the other side shot a person he found. He did that repeatedly, and as a result, he destroyed families.I saw a family that had been intact with a mother living with three of her children, some grandchildren. They all worked at various jobs. Some were going to school. They stood as they watched one of their—the mother stood as she watched one of her children be struck by a bullet that Mr. Maddicks fired and killed him because the bullet struck the middle of his head. That family was destroyed. They scattered to the four winds, and only one brother remained in New York who could testify.That case taught me that prosecutors, as all participants in the justice system, must be sensitive to the price that crime imposes on our entire society.At the same time, as a prosecutor in that case, I had to consider how to ensure that the presentation of that case would be fully understood by jurors, and to do that it was important for us as prosecutors to be able to present those number of incidences that Mr. Maddicks had engaged in, in one trial so the full extent of his conduct could be determined by a jury.There had never been a case quite like that where an individual who used different acrobatic feats to gain entry into an apartment was tried with all of his crimes in one indictment. I researched very carefully the law and found a theory in New York law, called the ‘‘Molineaux theory’’ then, that basically said if you can show a pattern that established a person’s identity or assisted in establishing a person’s identity—I’m simplifying the argument, by the way—then you can try different cases together. This was not a conspiracy under law because Mr. Maddicks acted alone, so I had to find a different theory to bring all his acts together.Well, I presented that to the trial judge. It was a different application of the law. But what I did was draw on the principles of the Molineaux theory, and arguing those principles to the judge, the judge permitted that joint trial of all of Mr. Maddicks’ activities.In the end, carefully developing the facts in the case, making my record—our record, I should say—Mr. Mo’s and my record complete, we convinced the judge that our theory was supported by law. That harkens back to my earlier answer, which is that’s what being a trial judge teaches you.

Well, it’s important to remember that as a judge, I don’t make law, and so the task for me as a judge is not to accept or not accept new theories. It’s to decide whether the law as it exists has principles that apply to new situations.

You are correct, Senator, that the panel, made up of myself and two other judges, in the Second Circuit decided that case on the basis of a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court and on the basis of established precedent.The issue was not what we would do or not do, because we were following precedent, and you—we’re now on the circuit court—are obligated on a panel to follow established circuit precedent.The issue in Ricci was what the city did or could do when it was presented with a challenge to one of its tests that—for promotion. This was not a quota case. This was not an affirmative action case. This was a challenge to a test that everybody agreed had a very wide difference between the pass rate of a variety of different groups.The city was faced with the possibility, recognized in law, that the employees who were disparately impacted—that’s the terminology used in the law, and that is a part of the civil rights amendment that you were talking about in 1991—that those employees who could show a disparate impact, a disproportionate pass rate, that they could bring a suit, and that then the employer had to defend the test that it gave.The city here, after a number of days of hearings and a variety of different witnesses, decided that it wouldn’t certify the test, and it wouldn’t certify it in an attempt to determine whether they could develop a test that was of equal value in measuring qualifications, but which didn’t have a disparate impact.And so the question before the panel was: Was the decision of the city based on race or based on its understanding of what the law required it to do? Given Second Circuit precedent, Bushey v. New York State Civil Services Commission, the panel concluded that the city’s decision in that particular situation was lawful under established law.The Supreme Court, in looking and reviewing that case, applied a new standard. In fact, it announced that it was applying a standard from a different area of law, and explaining to employers and the courts below how to look at this question in the future.

Absolutely. 

Absolutely, sir. 

That is now the statement of the Supreme Court of how employers and the Court should examine this issue.

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to explain my remarks. No words I have ever spoken or written have received so much attention.[Laughter.] Judge SOTOMAYOR. I gave a variant of my speech to a variety of different groups, most often to groups of women lawyers or to groups most particularly of young Latino lawyers and students. As my speech made clear in one of the quotes that you referenced, I was trying to inspire them to believe that their life experiences would enrich the legal system, because different life experiences and backgrounds always do. I don’t think that there is a quarrel with that in our society. I was also trying to inspire them to believe that they could become anything they wanted to become, just as I had. The context of the words that I spoke have created a misunderstanding, and I want—a misunderstanding, and to give everyone assurances, I want to state up front unequivocally and without doubt, I do not believe that any ethnic, racial, or gender group has an advantage in sound judging. I do believe that every person has an equal opportunity to be a good and wise judge regardless of their background or life experiences. The words that I used, I used agreeing with the sentiment that Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was attempting to convey. I understood that sentiment to be what I just spoke about, which is that both men and women were equally capable of being wise and fair judges.That has to be what she meant, because judges disagree about legal outcomes all of the time—or I shouldn’t say ‘‘all of the time.’’ At least in close cases they do. Justices on the Supreme Court come to different conclusions. It can’t mean that one of them is unwise— despite the fact that some people think that.So her literal words couldn’t have meant what they said. She had to have meant that she was talking about the equal value of the capacity to be fair and impartial.

I believe my 17-year record on the two courts would show that in every case that I render, I first decide what the law requires under the facts before me, and that what I do is explained to litigants why the law requires a result. And whether their position is sympathetic or not, I explain why the result is commanded by law.

That is the fundamental job of a judge. 

Yes, sir. 

It is. 

Completely, sir. I accepted and applied established Supreme Court precedent that the Supreme Court in its own opinion in Heller acknowledged answered a different question. 

Like you, I understand how important the right to bear arms is to many, many Americans. In fact, one of my godchildren is a member of the NRA, and I have friends who hunt. I understand the individual right fully that the Supreme Court recognized in Heller.As you pointed out, Senator, in the Heller decision the Supreme Court was addressing a very narrow issue, which was whether an individual right under the Second Amendment applied to limit the Federal Government’s rights to regulate the possession of firearms. The Court expressly, Justice Scalia in a footnote, identified that there was Supreme Court precedent that has said that that right is not incorporated against the States. What that term of ‘‘incorporation’’ means in the law is that that right doesn’t apply to the States in its regulation of its relationship with its citizen.In Supreme Court parlance, the right is not fundamental. It’s a legal term. It’s not talking about the importance of the right in a legal term. It’s talking about is that right incorporated against the States.When Maloney came before the Second Circuit, as you indicated, myself and two other judges read what the Supreme Court said, saw that it had not explicitly rejected its precedent on application to the States, and followed that precedent, because it’s the job of the Supreme Court to change it.

You asked me—I’m sorry, Senator. I didn’t mean to cut you off. 

You asked me whether I have an open mind on that question. Absolutely. My decision in Maloney and on any case of this type would be to follow the precedent of the Supreme Court when it speaks directly on an issue, and I would not prejudge any question that came before me if I was a Justice on the Supreme Court.

No, sir. 

I believe my record of 17 years demonstrates fully that I do believe that law—that judges must apply the law and not make the law. Whether I’ve agreed with a party or not, found them sympathetic or not, in every case I have decided I have done what the law requires.With respect to judges’ making policy, I assume, Senator, that you were referred to a remark that I made in a Duke law student dialog. That remark in context made very clear that I wasn’t talking about the policy reflected in the law that Congress makes. That’s the job of Congress to decide what the policy should be for society.In that conversation with the students, I was focusing on what district court judges do and what circuit court judges do, and I noted that district court judges find the facts and they apply the facts to the individual case. And when they do that, their holding, their finding doesn’t bind anybody else.Appellate judges, however, establish precedent. They decide what the law says in a particular situation. That precedent has policy ramifications because it binds not just the litigants in that case; it binds all litigants in similar cases, in cases that may be influenced by that precedent.I think if my speech is heard outside of the minute and a half that YouTube presents and its full context examined, it is very clear that I was talking about the policy ramifications of precedent and never talking about appellate judges or courts making the policy that Congress makes.

Never their prejudices. I was talking about the very important goal of the justice system is to ensure that the personal biases and prejudices of a judge do not influence the outcome of a case. What I was talking about was the obligation of judges to examine what they’re feeling as they’re adjudicating a case and to ensure that that’s not influencing the outcome.Life experiences have to influence you. We’re not robots to listen to evidence and don’t have feelings. We have to recognize those feelings and put them aside. That’s what my speech was saying. That’s our job.

I don’t believe so, Senator, because all I was saying is because we have feelings and different experiences, we can be led to believe that our experiences are appropriate. We have to be open-minded to accept that they may not be and that we have to judge always that we’re not letting those things determine the outcome. But there are situations in which some experiences are important in the process of judging because the law asks us to use those experiences.

I think the system is strengthened when judges don’t assume they’re impartial but when judges test themselves to identify when their emotions are driving a result or their experiences are driving a result and the law is not.

Well, as I have tried to explain, what I try to do is to ensure that they’re not. If I ignore them and believe that I’m acting without them, without looking at them and testing that I’m not, then I could, unconsciously or otherwise, be led to be doing the exact thing I don’t want to do, which is to let something but the law command the result.

What I was speaking about in that speech was—harkened back to what we were just talking about a few min-utes ago, which is life experiences do influence us, in good ways. That’s why we seek the enrichment of our legal system from life experiences. That can affect what we see or how we feel, but that’s not what drives a result.The impartiality is an understanding that the law is what commands the result. And so to the extent that we are asking the question—because most of my speech was an academic discussion—about what should we be thinking about, what should we be considering in this process, and accepting that life experiences could make a difference, but I wasn’t encouraging the belief or attempting to encourage the belief that I thought that that should drive the result.

No, sir. As I’ve indicated, my record shows that at no point or time have I ever permitted my personal views or sympathies to influence an outcome of a case. In every case where I have identified a sympathy, I have articulated it and explained to the litigant why the law requires a different result——

I do not permit my sympathies, personal views, or prejudices to influence the outcome of my cases. 

It’s not a question of choosing to see some facts or another, Senator. I didn’t intend to suggest that, and in the wider context, what I believe I was—the point that I was making was that our life experiences do permit us to see some facts and understand them more easily than others. But in the end, you are absolutely right; that’s why we have appellate judges that are more than one judge, because each of us from our life experiences will more easily see different perspectives argued by parties. But judges do consider all of the arguments of litigants. I have. Most of my opinions, if not all of them, explain to parties why the law requires what it does. 

No, sir. I don’t stand by the understanding of that statement that I will ignore other facts or other experiences because I haven’t had them. I do believe that life experiences are important to the process of judging; they help you to understandand listen; but that the law requires a result, and it will command you to the facts that are relevant to the disposition of the case.

My friend Judge Cedarbaum is here this afternoon, and we are good friends, and I believe that we both approach judging in the same way, which is looking at the facts of each individual case and applying the law to those facts.I also, as I explained, was using a rhetorical flourish that fell flat. I knew that Justice O’Connor couldn’t have meant that if judges reached different conclusions, legal conclusions, that one of them wasn’t wise. That couldn’t have been her meaning because reasonable judges disagree on legal conclusions in some cases.So I was trying to play on her words. My play was—fell flat. It was bad, because it left an impression that I believed that life experiences commanded a result in a case. But that’s clearly not what I do as a judge. It’s clearly not what I intended. In the context of my broader speech, which was attempting to inspire young Hispanic, Latino students and lawyers to believe that their life experiences added value to the process.

No, sir. The panel was composed of me and two other judges. In a very similar case, the Seventh Circuit, in an opinion authored by Judge Easterbrook—I’m sorry. I misspoke. It wasn’t Judge Easterbrook. It was Judge Posner—saw the case in an identical way. And neither judge—I have confused some statements that Senator Leahy made with this case, and I apologize.In a very similar case, the Sixth Circuit approached a very similar issue in the same way. So a variety of different judges on the appellate court were looking at the case in light of established Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent and determined that the city, facing potential liability under Title VII, could choose not to certify the test if it believed an equally good test could be made with a different impact on affected groups.The Supreme Court, as it is its prerogative in looking at a challenge, established a new consideration or a different standard for the city to apply, and that is, was there substantial evidence that they would be held liable under the law?That was a new consideration. Our panel didn’t look at that issue that way because it wasn’t argued to us in the case before us and because the case before us was based on existing precedent. So it is a different test——

Because those cases were not what was at issue in this decision, and, in fact, those cases were not what decided the Supreme Court’s decision. The Supreme Court parties were not arguing the level of scrutiny that would apply with respect to intentional discrimination. The issue is a different one before our court and the Supreme Court, which is, What is a city to do when there is proof that its test disparately impacts a particular group? And the Supreme Court decided, not on the basis of strict scrutiny, that what it did here was wrong, what the city did here was wrong, but on the basis that the city’s choice was not based on asubstantial basis in evidence to believe it would be held liable under the law.Those are two different standards, two different questions that a case would present.

The panel decision was based on a 78-page District Court opinion. The opinion referenced it. In its per curiam, the Court incorporated it directly, but it was referenced by the circuit. And it relied on that very thoughtful, thorough opinion by the District Court. And that opinion discussed Second Circuit precedent in its fullest—to its fullest extent.Justice Cabranes had one view of the case; the panel had another. The majority of the vote—it wasn’t just my vote—the majority of the Court, not just my vote, denied the petition for rehearing.The court left to the Supreme Court the question of how an employer should address what no one disputed, was prima facie evidence that its test disparately impacted on a group. That was undisputed by everyone, but the case law did permit employees that had been disparately impacted to bring a suit.The question was, for the city, was it racially discriminating when it didn’t accept those tests or was it attempting to comply with the law.

We were very sympathetic and expressed our sympathy to the firefighters who challenged the city’s decision, Mr. Ricci and the others. We understood the efforts that they had made in taking the test; we said as much.They did have before them a 78-page thorough opinion by the District Court. They obviously disagreed with the law as it stood under Second Circuit precedent. That’s why they were pursuing their claims and did pursue them further.In the end, the body that had the discretion and power to decide how these tough issues should be decided, that along the precedent that had been recognized by our circuit court and another at least, the Sixth Circuit, but along what the Court thought would be the right test or standard to apply. And that’s what the Supreme Court did. It answered that important question because it had the power to do that. Not the power, but the ability to do that because it was faced with the arguments that suggested that. The panel was dealing with precedent and arguments that relied on our precedent.

Good morning. 

To the extent that reasonable minds can differ on any case, that’s true as to what the legal conclusion should be in a case. But the panel, at least as the case was presented— was relying on the reasonable views that Second Circuit precedent had established.And so, to the extent that one, as a judge, adheres to precedents, because it is that which dies and gives stability to the law, then those reasonable minds, who decided the precedent and the judges who apply it, are coming to the legal conclusion they think the facts and laws require.

I believe what my record shows is that I follow the law, and that my small reversal rate, vis-a-vis the vast body of cases that I have examined—because you’ve mentioned only the opinions I’ve authored. But I’ve been a participant in thousands more that have not been either reviewed by the Supreme Court or reversed. 

Few judges could claim they love baseball more than I do, for obvious reasons. But analogies are always imperfect, and I prefer to describe what judges do, like umpires, is to be impartial and bring an open mind to every case before them. And by an open mind, I mean a judge who looks at the facts of each case, listens and understands the arguments of the parties, and applies the law as the law commands.It’s a refrain I keep repeating because that is my philosophy of judging, applying the law to the facts at hand. And that’s my description of judging.

Senator, to suggest that I admire one of the sitting Supreme Court justices would suggest that I think of myself as a clone of one of the justices. I don’t. Each one of them brings integrity, their sense of respect for the law, and their sense of their best efforts and hard work to come to the decisions they think the law requires. Going further than that would put me in the position of suggesting that by picking one justice, I was disagreeing or criticizing another, and I don’t wish to do that. I wish to describe just myself. I’m a judge who believes that the facts drive the law and the conclusion that the law will apply to that case. And when I say drives the law, I mean determines how the law will apply in that individual case. If you would ask me—instead, if you permit me to tell you a justice from the past that I admire for applying that approach to the law, it would be Justice Cardozo. Now, Justice Cardozo didn’t spend a whole lot of time on the Supreme Court; he had an untimely passing. But he had been a judge on the New York Court of Appeals for a very long time. And during his short tenure on the bench, one of the factors that he was so well known for was his great respect for precedent, and his great respect for respect and deference to the legislative branch, and to the other branches of government and their powers under the Constitution. In those regards, I do admire those parts of Justice Cardozo, which he was most famous for, and think that that is how I approach the law, as a case-by-case application of law to facts. 

The question of whether affirmative action is necessary in our society or not and what form it should take is always first a legislative determination in terms of legislative or government employer determination in terms of what issue it is addressing and what remedy it is looking to structure.The Constitution promotes and requires the equal protection of law of all citizens in its Fourteenth Amendment. To ensure that protection, there are situations in which race in some form must be considered. The courts have recognized that. Equality requires effort, and so there are some situations in which some form of race has been recognized by the Court.It is firmly my hope, as it was expressed by Justice O’Connor in her decision involving the University of Michigan Law School admissions criteria, that in 25 years, race in our society won’t be needed to be considered in any situation. That’s the hope, and we’ve taken such great strides in our society to achieve that hope.But there are situations in which there are compelling state interests. And the admissions case that Justice O’Connor was looking at, the Court recognized that in the education field. And the state is applying a solution that is very narrowly tailored. And there the Court determined that the law school’s use of race as only one factor among many others, with no presumption of admission whatsoever, was appropriate under the circumstances.In another case, companion case, the Court determined that a more fixed use of race that didn’t consider the individual was inappropriate, and it struck down the undergraduate admissions policy.That is what the Court has said about the educational use of race in a narrow way.The question, as I indicated, of whether that should apply in other contexts has not been looked at by the Supreme Court directly. The holdings of that case have not been applied or discussed in another case. That would have to await another state action that would come before the Court, where the state would articulate its reasons for doing what it did, and the Court would consider if those actions were constitutional or not.

That case took the attention of the nation, and there’s been so much discussion about what the Court did or didn’t do.I look at the case, and my reaction as a sitting judge is not to criticize it or to challenge it, even if I were disposed that way, because I don’t take a position on that; that the Court took and made the decision it did.The question for me as I look at that sui generis situation—it’s only happened once in the lifetime of our country—is that some good came from that discussion. There’s been and was enormous electoral process changes in many states as a result of the flaws that were reflected in the process that went on.That is a tribute to the greatness of our American system, which is whether you agree or disagree with a Supreme Court decision, that all of the branches become involved in the conversation of how to improve things. And as I indicated, both Congress, who devoted a very significant amount of money to electoral reform in its legislation—and states have looked to address what happened there.

Kelo is now a precedent of the Court. I must follow it. I am bound by a Supreme Court decision as a Second Circuit judge. As a Supreme Court judge, I must give it the deference that the doctrine of the stare decisis would suggest.The question of the reach of Kelo has to be examined in the context of each situation. And the Court did in Kelo note that there was a role for the courts to play in ensuring that takings by a state did, in fact, intend to serve the public—a public purpose and public use.I understand the concern that many citizens have expressed about whether Kelo did or did not honor the importance of property rights, but the question in Kelo was a complicated one about what constituted public use. And there the Court held that a taking to develop an economically blighted area was appropriate.

I don’t prejudge issues. 

That is actually—I come to every case with an open mind. 

Every case is a new for me. 

That is the precedent of the Court, so it is settled law. 

There is a right of privacy. The Court has founded in various places in the Constitution, has recognized rights under those various provisions of the Constitution. It’s founded in the Fourth Amendment’s right and prohibition against unreasonable search and seizures. Most commonly, it’s considered—I shouldn’t say most commonly because search and seizure cases are quite frequent before the Court. But it’s also found in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution when it is considered in the context of the liberty interest protected by the due process clause of the Constitution. 

The Court’s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the core holding of Roe. That is the precedent of the Court and settled in terms of the holding of the Court. 

As I said, Casey reaffirmed the holding in Roe. That is the Supreme Court’s settled interpretation of what the core holding is and its reaffirmance of it. 

I have had positive experiences with cameras. When I have been asked to join experiments using cameras in the courtroom, I have participated. I have volunteered.Perhaps it would be useful if I explained to you my approach to collegiality on a court.[Laughter.] Judge SOTOMAYOR. It is my practice when I enter a new enterprise, whether it’s on a court or in my private practice or when I was a prosecutor, to experience what those courts were doing, or those individuals doing that job were doing, understand and listen to the arguments of my colleagues about why certain practices were necessary or helpful, or why certain practices shouldn’t be done, or new procedures tried, and then spend my time trying to convince them. But I wouldn’t try to come in with prejudgments, so that they thought that I was unwilling to engage in a conversation with them, or unwilling to listen to their views. I go in and I try to share my experiences, to share my thoughts, and to be collegial and come to a conclusion together. And I can assure you that if this august body gives me the privilege of becoming a justice of the Supreme Court, that I will follow that practice with respect to the tall issues of procedures on the Court, including the question of cameras in the courtroom. 

You know, I’m pretty good—— 

I would be, again, if I was fortunate enough to be confirmed, a new voice in the discussion, and new voices often see things, and talk about them, and consider taking new approaches. 

All questions of policy are within the providence of Congress first. And so, that particular question would have to be considered by Congress first. But it would have to consider it in light of the Constitution and then of statutes that govern these issues. And so, that first step and decision would be Congress’.I can only note that there was a purpose to the structure of our Constitution, and it was a view by the Founding Fathers that they wanted justices who would not be subject to political whim or to the emotions of a moment. And they felt that by giving them certain protections, that that would ensure their objectivity and their impartiality over time.I do know, having served with many of my colleagues who have been members of the court, sometimes for decades, I had one colleague who was still an active member of the court in his nineties. And at close to 90, he was learning the Internet and encouraging my colleagues of a much younger age to participate in learning the Internet.So I don’t think that it’s service or the length of time. I think there’s wisdom that comes to judges from their experience that helps them in the process over time. I think in the end, it is a question of, one, of what the structure are of our government is best served by. And as I said, the policy question will be considered first by Congress and the processes set forth by the Constitution. But I do think there is a value in the services of judges for long periods of time.

I cannot speak, Senator, to whether Leegins was right or wrong; it’s now the established law of the Court. That case in large measure centered around the justices, different viewsof the effects of stare decisis on a question which none of them seemed to dispute, that there were a basis to question the economic assumptions of the Court in this field of law.Leegins is the Court’s holding, its teachings and holding. And I will have to apply in new cases, so I can’t say more than what I know about it and what I thought the Court was doing there.With respect to my record, I can’t speak for why someone else would view my record as suggesting a pro or anti approach to any series of cases. All of the business cases, as with all of the cases, my structure of approaching is the same; what is the law requiring?I would note that I have cases that have upheld antitrust complaints and upheld those cases going forward. I did it in my Visa/ MasterCard antitrust decision, and that was also a major decision in this field.All I can say is that with business and the interest of any party before me, I will consider and apply the law as it is written by Congress and informed by precedent.

All precedents of the Supreme Court I consider settled law subject to the deference with doctrine of stare decisis would counsel.

I am, sir. 

The issue—— 

Well, it not only didn’t decide it, but I understood Justice Scalia to be recognizing that the Court’s precedent had held it was not—his opinion with respect to the application of the Second Amendment to government regulation was a different inquiry, and a different inquiry as to the meaning of U.S. Miller with respect to that issue. 

That’s the very question that the Supreme Court is more than likely to be considering. There are three cases addressing this issue, at least I should say three cases addressing this issue in the circuit courts. And so, it’s not a question that I can address. As I said, bring an open mind to every case. 

No, sir, because that’s not—I’m not taking an opinion on that issue because it’s an open question. Sanchez is—— 

Well, I admit that Justice—I admit—I—the courts have been addressing that question. The Supreme Court in the opinion authored by Justice Scalia suggested that it was a question that the Court should consider. I am just attempting to explain that U.S. v. Sanchez was using fundamental in its legal sense, that whether or not it had been incorporated against the states. With respect to that question, moreover, even if it’s not incorporated against the states, the question would be would the states have a rational basis for the regulation it has in place. And I am— I believe that the question there was whether or not a prohibition against felons possessing firearms was at question, if my memory serves me correctly. If it doesn’t—but even Justice Scalia in the majority opinion in Heller recognized that that was a rational basis regulation for a state under all circumstances, whether or not there was a Second Amendment right. 

I do remember that discussion. 

My conclusion in the Maloney case or in the U.S. Sanchez-Villar was based on precedence and the holding of precedence that the Second Circuit did not apply to the states. 

The Supreme Court’s decision with respect to the Second Circuit incorporation—Second Amendment incorporation doctrine is reliant on old precedent of the Court.

And I don’t mean to use that as precedent that doesn’t bind when I call it old. I’m talking about precedent that was passed in the 19th century. Since that time, there is no question that different cases addressing different amendments of the Constitution have applied a different framework. And whether that framework and the language you quoted are precise or not, I haven’t examined that framework in a while to know if that language is precise or not. I’m not suggesting it’s not, Senator. I just can’t affirm—— 

Those rights have been incorporated against the states. The states must comply with them. So to the extent that the Court has held that, then they are—they have been deemed fundamental as that term is understood legally. 

As well. 

But with respect to the holding as it relates to that particular amendment. 

That plus some Second Circuit precedent that had held that it had not—that the amendment had not been——

It was. 

It may have. I haven’t read it recently enough to remember exactly. 

Okay. I’ll accept—— 

As I said, I haven’t examined those cases recently enough to be able to answer your question, Senator. But what I can say is that regardless of what those pieces address or didn’t address, the Second Circuit had very directly addressed the question of whether the Second—whether it viewed the Second Amendment as applying against the states. To that extent, if that precedent got the Supreme Court’s teachings wrong, it still would bind my court. 

And to the extent that—— 

As I said, Senator, I just haven’t looked at those cases to analyze it. I know what Heller said about them. In Maloney, we were addressing a very, very narrow question. 

And in the end, the issue of whether that precedent should be followed or not is a question the Supreme Court’s going to address if it accepts certiorari in one of the three cases in which courts have looked at this question, the Court of Appeals has.

Well, all standards of the Court are attempting to ensure that government action has a basis.

In some situations, the Court looks at the action and applies a stricter scrutiny to the government’s action. In others, if it’s not a fundamental right in the way the law defines that, but it hasn’t been incorporated against the states, then standard of review is of rational basis. 

Well, the government can remedy a social problem that it is identifying or difficulty—it’s identifying in conduct, not in the most narrowly tailored way. But one that reasonably seeks to achieve that result, in the end, it can’t be arbitrary and capricious. That’s a word that is not in the definition. 

As I said, the rational basis does look more broadly than strict scrutiny may—— 

Sir, in Maloney we were talking about nunchuck sticks. 

Those are martial art sticks. 

Exactly. And when the sticks are swung, which is what you do with them, if there’s anybody near you, you’re going to be seriously injured because that swinging mechanism can break arms, it can bust someone’s skull—— 

I believe they cited the Bushey case. 

They dealt with when employees could prove a disparate impact of a case, and it would be——

I’m sorry. Say this again. 

Again, regardless of what the challenge is about, what test is at issue, the core holding of that precedent was that if an employee could show a disparate impact from a particular practice or test or activity by an employer, then that employee had a prima facie case of liability under Title VII. So the question is, was the city subject to potential liability because the employees, the city of New Haven, because the employees could bring a suit under established law challenging that the city of New Haven had violated Title VII. So that was the question. 

Well, the District Court noted that it was a different scenario, but it evaluated its decision—it evaluated the case in a 78-page decision, and gave a full explanation, one which the panel agreed with my adopting the opinion of the District Court. Those questions, as I indicated, are always whether, given the risk the city was facing, the fact that it could face a lawsuit and its conclusion that perhaps a better test could be devised that would not have a disparate impact, whether it was liable for discrimination—disparate—not disparate—different treatment under the law. The Supreme Court came back and said, new standard. As I understood the dissenters in that case, what they were saying is, to the majority, if you’re going to apply a new standard, then give the Second Circuit a chance to look at the record and apply that stand-ard. It wasn’t disagreeing that the circuit wasn’t applying the law as it was understood at the time. The dissenters, as I read what they were doing, were saying, send it back to the circuit and let them look at this in the first instance.

That was his view. He expressed it in his opinion on his vote. I can’t speak for him. I know that the panel—— 

He was talking about whether—I understood him to be talking about not whether the precedent that existed would have determined the outcome as the panel did, but whether the Court should be looking at these two provisions in a different way to establish a choice—a different choice in considerations by the city. As I indicated, that argument about what new standard or new approach to the questions that the city should consider before it denies certification of a test, yes, had not been addressed by other courts. But the ability of a city, when presented with a prima facie case, to determine whether or not it would attempt to reach a nondisparate impact have been recognized by the courts. 

Absolutely, Senator. I would never, ever endorse, approve or tolerate, if I had any control over individuals, that kind of conduct.

Thank you, Senator. 

Yes. 

That’s correct. 

Yes, Senator. 

It is somewhat difficult to answer that question because before the court in any one case is a particular factual situation. So how the court’s precedent applies to that unique factual situation because often what comes before the court is something that’s different than its prior decision. Not always, but often. In the Carhart case, the court looked to its precedence, and as I understood that case, it was deciding a different question which was whether there were other means, safer means and equally effective means for a woman to exercise her right, the procedure at issue in the case. That was, I don’t believe, a rejection of its prior precedence. Its prior precedence are still the precedence of the court. The health and welfare of a woman must be a compelling consideration. 

You mentioned many cases. It has been a part of the court’s jurisprudence and a part of its precedence. Those precedents must be given deference in any situation that arises before the court.

The Doctrine of Starry Decisis which means stand by a decision, stand by a prior decision, has a basic premise. That basic premise is that there is a value in society to predictability, consistency, fairness, evenhandedness in the law. This society has an important expectation that judges won’t change the law based on personal whim or not. But they will be guided by a humility they should show and the thinking of prior judges who have considered weighty questions and determined as best as they could given the tools that they had at the time to establish precedent. There are circumstances under which a court should reexamine precedent and perhaps change its direction or perhaps reject it. But that should be done very, very cautiously and I keep emphasizing the verys because the presumption is in favor of deference to precedent. The question then becomes what are the factors you use to change it, and then courts have looked at a variety of different factors, applying each in a balance in determining where that balance falls at a particular moment. It is important to recognize, however, that the development of the law is step by step, case by case. There are some situations in which there is a principled way to distinguish precedent from application to a new situation. No, I do not believe a judge should act in an unprincipled way, but I recognize that both the Doctrine of Starry Decisis starts from a presumption that deference should be given to precedence and that the development of the law is case by case. It is always a very fine balance. 

That’s a very broad question. 

And that is why I have to be very cautious in answering it. 

Because not only is Congress grappling with this issue, but so are courts by claims being raised by many litigants who are asserting whether they are right or wrong would need to be addressed in each individual case that the President in taking some activity against the individual has exceeded Congress’ authorizations or his powers. The best I can do in answering your question because there is so many pending cases addressing this issue in such a different variety of ways is to say that the best expression of how to address this in a particular situation was made by Justice Jackson in his concurrence in the Youngstown seizure cases. That involved President Truman’s seizure of seal factories. There, Justice Jackson has sort of set off the framework and articulation that no one has thought of a better way to make it. He says that you always have to look at an assertion by the president that he or she is acting within executive power in the context of what Congress has done or not done. He always starts with first you look at whether Congress has expressly or implicitly addressed or authorized the president to act in a certain way. If the President has, then he is acting at his highest statute of power. If the President is acting in prohibition of an express or implied act of Congress, then he is working at his lowest edge. If he is acting where Congress hasn’t spoken, then we are in what Justice Jackson called the Zone of Twilight. The issue in any particular case is always starting with what Congress says or has not said and then looking at what the Constitution has, what it says about the powers of the President minus Congress’ powers in that area.You can’t speak more specifically than that in response to your statement that we are part of your question, other than to say the President can’t act in violation of the Constitution. No one is above the law.But what that is in a particular situation has to be looked at in the factual scenario before the court.

I can talk about what we did in Doe as reflective of the approach that we used in that case. It is difficult to talk about an absolute approach in any case.

Because each case presets its own actions by parties in its own set of competing considerations often. In Doe, the District Court had invalidated the Congressional statute all together, reasoning that the statute violated the Constitution in a number of different ways and that those violations did not authorize Congress to act in the manner it did. As the panel said that decision recognizing that deference to the executive is important in national security questions. In deference to Congress because the District Court was validating an Act of Congress. We had, as an appellate court, to be very cautious about what we were doing in this area and to balance and keep consistent with constitutional requirements the actions that were being taken. Giving back due deference, we upheld most of the statute. What we did was address two provisions of the statute that didn’t pass in our judgment, constitutional muster. One of them was that the law as Supreme Court precedence had commanded required that if the government was going to stop an individual from speaking in this particular context, that the gov-ernment had to come to court immediately to get court approval of that step.The statute instead required the individual who was restricted to come and challenge the restriction. We said no, government is acting. You have a right to speak. If you have a right to speak, you should know what the grounds for that right are and you should be told or brought to court to be given an opportunity to have that restriction lifted.The other was a question of who wore the burden of supporting that restriction and the statute held that it was the individual who was being burdened who had to prove that there wasn’t a reason for it.The government agreed with our court that that burden violated Supreme Court precedent and the premises of freedom of speech and agreed that the burden should not be that way and we read the statute to explain what the proper burden was.There is in all of these cases a balance and deference that is needed to be given to the executive and to Congress in certain situations. But we are a court that protects the Constitution and the rights of individuals under it and we must ensure and act with caution whenever reviewing a claim before us.

No, I know. But the question assumes a prejudgment by me of what is an appropriate approach or not in a new case that may come before me as a Second Circuit judge or again if I’m fortunate enough to be a Justice on the Supreme Court. So it is not a case I can answer in a broad statement.I can say that the court in reviewing congressional acts as it relates to an exercise of powers under the Commerce clause has looked at a wide variety of factors and considered that in different areas.But there is a framework that those cases have addressed, and that framework would have to be considered with respect to each case that comes before the court.Now, I know that you mentioned a number of different cases and if you have one in particular that concerns you, perhaps I could talk about what the framework is that the court established in those cases.

The Gun Free Zone School Act which the court struck down with Lopez.

In that case and in some of its subsequent cases, the court was examining as I mentioned a wide variety of factors. They included whether the activity that the government was attempting to regulate was economic or non-economic, whether it was an area in which states traditionally regulated, whether the statute at issue had an interstate commerce provision as an element of the crime and then considered whether there was a substantial effect on commerce. It looked at the congressional findings on that last element, the court did, and determined that there weren’t enough in the factors that it was looking at to find that that particular statute was within Congress’ powers. That is the basic approach it has used to other statutes it has looked at. I would note that its most recent case in this area, the Raich case. The court did uphold a crime that was non-economic in the sense of that it involved just the possession of marijuana. There it looked at the broader statute in which that provision was passed and the intent of Congress to regulate a market in illegal drugs. So the broad principles established in those cases have been the court’s precedent. Its most recent holding suggests that another factor purports to look at and each situation will provide a unique factual setting that the court will apply those principles to. 

In fact there are cases pending before the courts raising those arguments. So those are issues that the courts are addressing. I can’t speak much more further than that because of the restrictions on me. 

I do believe that in all of the cases the court has addressed this issue that it pays particular attention to congressional findings. I know that individuals may disagree with what the court has done in individual cases, but it has never disavowed the impor-tance of deference to legislative findings with respect to legislation that it is passing within its powers under the Constitution.

Good afternoon, Senator Grassley. And it’s wonderful to see you again.

I share your view of the importance of property rights under the Constitution. As you know, I was a commercial litigator that represented national and international companies, and it wasn’t even the case that it was a difference between developed and under-developed countries. Many of my clients who were from developed countries chose to, in part, to invest in the United States because of the respect that our Constitution pays to property rights in its various positions, in its various amendments. With respect to the Kelo question, the issue in Kelo, as I understand it, is whether or not a State who had determined that there was a public purpose to the takings under the Takings Clause of the Constitution that requires the payment of just compensation when something is—is condemned for use by the government, whether the Takings Clause permitted the State, once it’s made a proper determination of public purpose and use according to the law, whether the State could then have a private developer do that public act, in essence. Could they contract with a private developer to effect the public purpose? And so the holding, as I understood it in Kelo, was a question addressed to that issue. With respect to the importance of property rights and the process that the State must use, I just point out to you that in another case involving that issue that came before me in a particular series of cases that I had involving a village in New York, that I—I ruled in favor of the property rights—the property owner’s rights to challenge the process that the State had followed in his case and to hold that the State had not given him adequate notice of their intent to use the property—well, not adequate notice not to use the property, but to be more precise, that they hadn’t given him an adequate opportunity to express his objection to the public taking in that case. 

Well, as I understood the Supreme Court’s decision in Kelo, it was looking at the court’s precedents over time and determining that its precedents had suggested that the two informed each other, that public purpose in terms of developing an area that would have a public improvement and use, that the two would inform each other. 

I know that there are many litigants who have expressed that view, and in fact there’s been many State legislators that have passed State legislation not permitting State governments to take in the situation that the Supreme Court approved of in Kelo.The question of whether the Supreme Court overstepped the Constitution, as I’ve indicated, the court—at least my understanding of the majority’s opinion—believed and explained why it thought not. I have to accept, because it is precedent, that as precedent and so I can’t comment further than to say that I understand the questions and I understand what State legislatures have done——

And would have to await another situation, or the court would, to apply the holding in that case. 

I can only talk about what the—the court said in the context of that particular case and to explain that it is the court’s holding, and so it’s entitled to stare decisis effect and deference. 

But the extent of that has to await the next step, the next cases. 

Well, that was the subject of much discussion in the Kelo case among the Justices, and with certain Justices in the dissent, hypothesizing that the limits were difficult to see, the majority taking the position that there were limits. As I’ve indicated to you, opining on a hypothetical is very, very difficult for a judge to do. 

And as a potential—as a potential Justice on the Supreme Court, but more importantly as a Second Circuit Judge still sitting, I can’t engage in a question that involves hypotheses. 

Well, it—the Constitution provides that when the government takes it has to pay compensation. As you know, the question of what constitutes an actual taking is a very complex one because there is a difference between taking a home and regulation that may or may not constitute a taking. So I’m not at all trying to not answer your question, Senator. 

Well, as I explained, if the taking violates the Constitution, I would be required to—to strike it down.

The Didden case presented a narrow issue that the court below——[Interruption by the audience.] 

Yes. 

I hope I remember where we were. [Laughter.] 

Senator, the right of property owners to have their day in court is a very important one, but there is a corollary to the right to have your day in court, which is that you have to bring it to court in a timely manner.

Because people who are relying on your assertion of rights should know when you’re going to make them. And so there’s a doctrine called the Statute of Limitations that says if a party knows, or has reason to know, of their injury, then that party has to come in to court and raise their arguments within that statute that sets the limits of the action. 

In the Didden case—oh, I’m sorry. 

No, no, no. 

No. I—I—— 

In the Didden case—— 

And the court below, and our court, ruled on that basis, that he hadn’t because he had reason to know about the injury that could occasion—that could come to him. 

Mr. Didden alleged in his complaint that the private developer had extorted him. Extortion, under the law, is defined as ‘‘an unlawful demand for money’’. On this one piece of property within a larger development that the private developer was actively engaged in doing what he had contracted with the State to do, to revive the economic base by making investments in it, the private developer knew that Mr. Didden has his claims.The private developer had his agreement with the State, and so he was doing, in—at least this was the private developer’s argument—what he was entitled to do, which is to say, we disagree. I’m claiming that I have a right under contract, you’re claiming that you have a right under the Takings Clause. Let’s settle this. I am going to lose X amount of money, so you pay me back for me not to do what I’m entitled to do under the law.That, however, was—those were the claims of the parties in the action. In the end, the decision of the court was, if you believe that the takings of your property were not proper under the public use, under the Takings Clause, and you knew that the State had entered a contract with this private developer, then you had knowledge that you could be injured and you should have come to court earlier.

Well, as I—as I have described the case—— 

The question comes up in the context of, what did Mr. Didden know? Did he have enough to know he could be injured? Was there no public use to which the property would apply, and what rights did the private developer have with the State? And so the extortion question came up in a legal context surrounding the relative rights of the parties. So as I said, extortion is a term, a legal term, which is someone demanding money with no lawful claim to it. I’m simplifying this because there’s different definitions of extortion that apply to different situations. 

But in the context of this case, that’s the simplest description of the case, I believe. 

Well, cases present claims by parties, and to the extent that Mr. Didden was raising claims that sounded in the issues the court was looking at in Kelo, certainly if Kelo had not come out and the court had to—for whatever reason, determined that somehow the Kelo decision affected the Statute of Limitations question, it may have had to reach the question. But courts do often wait for Supreme Courts to act on cases that are pending in order to see if some form of its analysis changes or not, or inform whether a different look should be given to the case. But on the bottom-line issue, Kelo didn’t change, in the judgment of the panel, the Statute of Limitations question. 

Well, Kelo didn’t control the outcome, the Statute of Limitations did, so there was no basis to go into anelaborate discussion of Kelo. The discussion of Kelo, really, was to say that we had understood the public taking issue that Mr. Didden had spent a lot of time in his argument about, but the ruling was based on the narrow Statute of Limitations ground so the Kelo discussion didn’t need to be longer because it wasn’t the holding of the case. The holding of the case was the Statute of Limitations.

To be able to answer your question I would need to explain a little bit more about the background.The Supreme Court has now ruled in that case that the conclusion of the Second Circuit would not be upheld on this narrow question, but the question the Second Circuit was looking at is, what did Congress intend or mean when, in the statute at issue, it said that the agency had to use the ‘‘best technology available to minimize an adverse environmental impact’’. Those were the statute’s words. In looking at that, the Circuit applied general statutory construction principles, which is, in our judgment, what was the ordinary meaning of that? And——

Oh, no. Absolutely not. 

Chevron speaks to agency action or interpretation, but ultimately the task of a court is to give deference to what Congress wants. That’s the very purpose of Congress’ legislation. And so what the court was trying to do there was to see if the agency’s interpretation, in light of the words of the statute and how Congress has used cost-benefit analysis in other statutes in this area, and determine what Congress intended. And so we looked at the language and it said just what it said, ‘‘best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impact’’.We looked at how Congress used cost-benefit in similar statutes and similar provisions—or I shouldn’t say similar, in other provisions. We noted that under the statutes at issue when Congress wanted the agency to use cost-benefit analysis, it said so. In this provision, Congress was silent but the language, in the panel’s judgment, was the language.And so in trying to discern what Congress’ intent was, we came to the conclusion not that cost had no role in the agency’s evaluation, but that Congress had specified a more limited role that costbenefit. We described it as cost-effectiveness. And, in fact, we voted to—voted past our decision, asked and sent the case back to describe to us exactly what the agency had done, and why. Had it used cost-benefit? Had it used cost-effectiveness? But cost was always going to be a part of what the agency could consider. The issue was more, in what approach did Congress’ words intend? And so agency deference is important, but Congress is the one who writes the statutes so you have to start as a court with, what did Congress intend?

Not—not at all, sir. We were trying to look at the statute as a whole and determine what Congress meant by words that appeared to say that ‘‘best technology available had to minimize environmental effect’’.

As I said, that does have—and as our opinion said—considerations of cost. But given that Congress didn’t use the cost-benefit—give the agency cost-benefit approval in the terms of this particular provision while it had in others, we determined that the agency and precedent interpreting provisions limited the use of cost-benefit analysis. 

No, sir. In that case we were talking about, and deciding, an issue of whether the agency had followed its own procedures in changing policy. We weren’t substituting our judgment for that of the agency, we were looking at the agency’s own regulations as to the procedure that it had to follow in order to change an approach by the agency. So, that was a completely different question. With respect to deference to administrative bodies, in case after case where Chevron deference required deference, I have voted in favor of upholding administrative—executive and administrative decisions. 

The American Bar Association rule on Code of Conduct does not permit me to talk about a pending case. I can talk to you about one of the delays for a substantial period of time in that decision, and it was that the Supreme Court was considering a case, the Massachusetts case, that had some relevancy, or at least had relevancy to the extent that the panel asked the parties to brief further the applicability of that case to that decision.

You were a very good lawyer, weren’t you, Senator? [Laughter.] 

September 11th was a horrific tragedy, for all of the victims of that tragedy and for the nation. I was in New York. My home is very close to the World Trade Center. I spent days not being able to drive a car into my neighborhood because my neighborhood was used as a staging area for emergency trucks.The issue of the country’s safety and the consequences of that great tragedy are the subject of continuing discussion among not just Senators, but the whole nation. In the end, the Constitution, by its terms, protects certain individual rights. That protection is often fact-specific. Many of its terms are very broad: so what’s an unreasonable search and seizure? What are other questions are fact-specific.But in answer to your specific question, did it change my view of the Constitution, no, sir. The Constitution is a timeless document. It was intended to guide us through decades, generation after generation, to everything that would develop in our country. It has protected us as a nation, it has inspired our survival. That doesn’t change.

I’m a historian by undergraduate training. I also love history books. It’s amazing how difficult it is to make judgments about one’s current positions. That’s because history permits us to look back and to examine the actual consequences that have arisen, and then judgments are made. As a Judge today, all I can do, because I’m not part of the legislative branch—it’s the legislative branch who has the responsibility to make laws consistent with that branch’s view of constitutional requirements in its powers. It’s up to the President to take his actions, and then it’s up to the court to just examine each situation as it arises. 

That the court is doing its task as judges. It’s looking, in each of those cases, at what the actions are of either the military, and what Congress has done or not done, and applied constitutional review to those actions. 

I smiled only because that’s not the way that judges look at that issue. We don’t decide whether mistakes were made, we look at whether action was consistent with constitutional limitations or statutory limitations.

Yes. 

I haven’t had cases—or a sufficient a number of cases—in this area to say that I can remember every Supreme Court decision on a question related to this topic. As you know, in the Youngstown case, the court held that the President had not acted within his powers in seizing the steel mills in the particular situation existing before him at the time. But the question or the framework doesn’t change, which is, each situation would have to be looked at individually because you can’t determine ahead of time with hypotheticals what a potential constitutional conclusion will be. As I may have said to an earlier question, academic discussion is just that. It’s presenting the extremes of every issue and attempting to debate about, on that extreme of the legal question, how should the judge rule? 

I can only accept your assumption. As I said, I—I have not had sufficient cases to—to—to have looked at what I know in light of that particular question that you’re posing.

I have never been an advisor to a President. That’s not a function I have served, so I don’t want to comment on what was done or not done by those advisors in that case. And it’s likely that some question—and I know some are pending before the court in one existing case, so I can’t comment. All I can—on whether that’s surprising or not. I can only tell you that I would be surprised if a court didn’t consider the Youngstown framework in a decision involving this question because it is—that case’s framework is how these issues are generally approached. 

Yes, sir. My own judgment is that it would seem odd, indeed, if any Justice would sit in review of a decision that they authored. I would think that the Judicial Code of Ethics that govern recusals would suggest and command that that would be inappropriate.

There are many cases in which a Justice, I understand, has decided cases as a Circuit Court judge that are not the subject of review that raise issues that the Supreme Court looks at later. What I would do in this situation, I would look at the practices of the Justices to determine whether or not I—that would counsel to—to recuse myself. I would just note that many legal issues, once they come before the court, present a different series of questions than the one one addresses as a Circuit Court. 

That’s always the issue that litigants are arguing in litigation. So to the extent that the Supreme Court has not addressed this question yet, and there’s a strong likelihood it may in the future, I can’t say to you that I’ve prejudged the case and decided this is exactly how I’m going to approach it in that case. 

Well—— 

One must remember that the Supreme Court’s analysis in its prior precedent predated its principles of— or the development of cases discussing the incorporation doctrine. Those are newer cases, and so the framework established in those cases may well inform. 

As I said, I—I am hesitant of prejudging and saying they will or won’t, because that will be what the parties are going to be arguing in the litigation. 

But it is—I’m sorry.

No. I was just suggesting that I do recognize that the court’s more recent jurisprudence in incorporation with respect to other amendments has taken—has been more recent, and those cases, as well as stare decisis and a lot of other things, will inform the court’s decision on how it looks at a new challenge to a State regulation. 

As I said earlier, you are a very eloquent advocate. But a decision on what the Supreme Court will do and what’s inevitable will come up before the Justices in great likelihood in the future, and I feel that I’m threading the line—— 

Okay. [Laughter.] 

It’s a question the court will have to consider. 

And it’s meaning—— [Laughter.] Judge SOTOMAYOR. Senator, the Supreme Court did hold that there is, in the Second Amendment, an individual right to bear arms, and that is its holding and that is the court’s decision. I fully accept that. In whatever new cases come before me that don’t involve incorporation as a Second Circuit judge, I would have to consider those—those issues in the context of a particular State regulation of firearms or other instruments. 

Well, the question for a judge as a judge would look at it, is to examine, first, what policy choices the Congress is making in its legislation. It is important to remember that some of the issues that you are addressing were part of congressional legislation as to how FISA would operate. And as you just said, there’s been amendments subsequent to that, and so a court would start with what Congress has—what Congress has done and whether the acts of the other branch of government is consistent with that or not. The issue of whether, and how, a particular document would affect national security or affect questions of that nature would have to be looked at in—with respect to an individual case. And as I understand it, there are review processes in the FISA procedure. I’m not a member of that court, so I am not intimately familiar with those procedures, but I know that this is part of the review process there, in part. And so when you ask concern, there is always some attention paid to the issue of—of the public reviewing or looking at the ac-tions that a court is taking, but that also is tempered with the fact that there are situations in which complete openness can’t be had, for a variety of different reasons.So courts—I did as a District Court judge and I have as a Circuit Court judge—looked at situations in which judges have to have determined whether juries should be empaneled anonymously, and in those situations we do consider the need for public actions, but we also consider that there may be, in some individual situations, potential threats to the safety of jurors that require an anonymous jury.I am attempting to speak about this as—it’s always a question of balance——

I can’t—it’s difficult to speak from the abstract, in large measure, because as I explained, I’ve never been a part of the FISA court and so I’ve never had the experience of reviewing what those documents are and whether they, in fact, can be redacted or not without creating risk to national security. One has to think about what the—what explanations the government has. There’s so many issues a court would have to look at. 

Yes, I live in New York City and it is a little different than other parts of the country, but I spend a lot of time in other parts of the country. I’ve visited a lot of States. I’ve stayed with people who do all types of work. I’ve lived on—not lived, I’ve visited and vacationed on farms. I’ve lived and vacationed in moun-taintops. I’ve lived and vacationed in all sorts—not lived. I’m using the wrong word. I’ve visited all sorts of places.In fact, one of my habits is, when I travel somewhere new, I try to find a friend I know to stay with them.And it’s often not because I can’t afford a hotel—usually the people who are inviting me would be willing to pay—but it’s because I do think it’s important to know more than what I live and to try to stay connected to people and to different experiences.I don’t think that one needs to live an experience without appreciating it, listening to it, watching it, reading about it, all of those things, experiencing it for a period of time, help judges in appreciating the concerns of other experiences that they don’t personally have. And as I said, I try very, very hard to ensure that, in my life, I introduce as much experience with other people’s lives as I can.

It was, sir. 

A judge should never rule from fear. A judge should rule from law and the Constitution. It is inconceivable to me today that a decision permitting the detention/arrest of an individual solely on the basis of their race would be considered appropriate by our government. 

One hopes, by having the wisdom of a Harlan in Plessy, by having the wisdom to understand, always, no matter what the situation, that our Constitution has held us in good stead for over 200 years and that our survival depends on upholding it. 

Sure. Good afternoon, by the way. 

Good afternoon, by the way.

In that case, yes. 

I haven’t actually been responding to that question, and I think you’re right proposing it. I clearly understand that recusing myself from Maloney would be appropriate. The impact of the joint hearing by the Court would suggest that I would have to apply the same principle, but as I indicated, issues of recusal are left to the discretion of Justices because their participation in cases is so important. It is something that I would discuss with my colleagues and follow their practices with respect to a question like this. 

As I said, that is an issue that is different than the question that was posed earlier—— 

It’s impossible to say I will recuse myself on any case involving Maloney. How the other cert. is granted and whether joint argument is presented or not, I would have to await to see what happened. 

Absolutely. The decision of the Court in Heller is—its holding has recognized an individual right to bear arms as applied to the Federal Government.

I didn’t quite follow the start of your question, Senator. I want to answer precisely.

But I’m not quite sure—— 

Senator, as I indicated, clearly the statute would reach Maloney. How I would respond to the Court taking certiorari in what case and whether it held—it took certiorari in one or all three is a question that I would have to await to see what the Court decides to do and what issues it addresses in its grant of certiorari. There is also the point that whatever comes before the Court will be on the basis of a particular State statute, which might involve other questions. It’s hard to speak about recusal in the abstract because there’s so many different questions that one has to look at. 

I didn’t understand their commitment to be broader than what I have just said, which is that they would certainly recuse themselves from any matter. I understood it to mean any case that they had been involved in as a circuit judge. If their practice was to recuse themselves more broadly, then obviously I would take counsel from what they did. But I believe, if my mem-ory is serving me correctly—and it may not be, but I think so—that Justice Alito as a Supreme Court Justice has heard issues that were similar to ones that he considered as a circuit court judge.So as I have indicated, I will take counsel from whatever the practices of the Justices are with the broader question of what——

No, sir. That’s—I don’t—wouldn’t approach the issue of judging in the way the President does. He has to explain what he meant by judging. I can only explain what I think judges should do, which is judges can’t rely on what’s in their heart. They don’t determine the law. Congress makes the laws. The job of a judge is to apply the law. And so it’s not the heart that compels conclusions in cases. It’s the law. The judge applies the law to the facts before that judge.

Well, I’ve actually had lawyers say something very similar to that.[Laughter.] Judge SOTOMAYOR. I have had lawyers where questions have been raised about the legal basis of their argument. I had one lawyer throw up his hands and say, ‘‘But it’s just not right.’’ ‘‘But it’s just not right’’ is not what judges consider. What judges consider is what the law says. 

Well, to the extent that every legal decision has—this is what I do in approaching legal questions, is I look atthe law that’s being cited. I look at how precedent informs it. I try to determine what those principles are of precedent to apply to the facts in the case before me and then do that.And so one—that is a process. You use—— 

No. I wasn’t—— 

When you say, use the words ‘‘some legal basis,’’ it suggests that a judge is coming to the process by saying I think the result should be here—— 

Exactly, sir. We apply law to facts. We don’t apply feelings to facts. 

Thank you. I have a record for 17 years. Decision after decision, decision after decision, it is very clear that I don’t base my judgments on my personal experiences or my feelings or my biases. All of my decisions show my respect for the rule of law, the fact that, regardless about if I identify a feeling about a case, which was part of what that speech did talk about, there are situations where one has reactions to speeches, to activities.It’s not surprising that in some cases the loss of a victim is very tragic. A judge deals with those situations, and acknowledging that there is a hardship to someone doesn’t mean that the law commands the result. I have any number of cases where I have acknowledged a particular difficulty to a party or disapproval of a party’s action and said, no, but the law requires this. So my views, I think, are demonstrated by what I do as a judge.I am grateful that you took notice that much of my speech, if not all of it, was intended to inspire, and my whole message to those students—and that is the very end of what I said to them—was, ‘‘I hope I see you in the courtroom someday.’’ I don’t know if I saidit in that speech, but I often end my speeches with saying, ‘‘And I hope someday you’re sitting on the bench with me.’’And so the intent of the speech, its structure, was to inspire them to believe, as I do, as I think everyone does, that life experiences enrich the legal system. I used the words ‘‘process of judging,’’ that experience that you look for in choosing a judge, whether it is the ABA rule that says the judge has to be a lawyer for X number of years, or it’s the experience that your Committee looks for in terms of what’s the background of the judge. Have they undertaken serious consideration of constitutional questions?All of those experiences are valued because our system is enriched by a variety of experiences. And I don’t think that anybody quarrels with the fact that diversity on the bench is good for America. It’s good for America because we are the land of opportunity, and to the extent that we are pursuing and showing that all groups can be lawyers and judges, that’s just reflecting the values of our society.

There are two different, I believe, issues to address and to look at because various statements are being looked at and being tied together. But the speech, as it is structured, didn’t intend to do that and didn’t do that. Much of the speech about what differences there will be in judging was in the context of my saying or addressing an academic question, all the studies that you reference I cited in my speech, which is that studies, they were suggesting that there could be a difference. They were raising reasons why I was inviting the students to think about that question. Most of the quotes that you had and reference say that.We have to ask this question: Does it make a difference? And if it does, how? And the study about differences in outcomes was in that context. There was a case in which three women judges went one way and two men went the other, but I didn’t suggest that that was driven by their gender. You can’t make that judgment until you see what the law actually said. And I wasn’t talking about what law they were interpreting in that case. I was just talking about the academic question that one should ask.

No. What I’ve seen—— 

I was using a rhetorical riff that harkened back to Justice O’Connor, because her literal words and mine have a meaning that neither of us, if you were looking at it, in their exact words make any sense. Justice O’Connor was a part of a Court in which she greatly respected her colleagues, and yet those wise men—I am not going to use the other word—and wise womendid reach different conclusions in deciding cases. I never understood her to be attempting to say that that meant those people who disagreed with her were unwise or unfair judges.As you noted, my speech was intending to inspire the students to understand the richness that their backgrounds could bring to the judicial process in the same way that everybody else’s background does the same. I think that’s what Justice Alito was referring to when he was asked questions by this Committee, and he said, ‘‘You know, when I decide a case, I think about my Italian ancestors and their experiences coming to this country.’’ I don’t think anybody thought that he was saying that that commanded the result in the case. These were students and lawyers who I don’t think would have been misled either by Justice O’Connor’s statement or mine in thinking that we actually intended to say that we could really make wiser and fairer decisions. I think what they could think and would think is that I was talking about the value that life experiences have, in the words I used, in the process of judging. And that is the context in which I understood the speech to be doing.The words I chose, taking the rhetorical flourish, it was a bad idea. I do understand that there are some who have read this differently, and I understand why they might have concern. But I have repeated more than once, and I will repeat throughout, if you look at my history on the bench, you will know that I do not believe that any ethnic, gender, or race group has an advantage in sound judging. You noted that my speech actually said that. And I also believe that every person, regardless of their background and life experiences, can be good and wise judges.

That commitment I can make and have made for 17 years.

All of America did. That was a loss of life that was traumatizing for New York State, because it happened off the shores of Long Island. And I know, Senator, that you were heavily involved in ministering to the families during that case. 

Everyone had sympathy for their loss. It was absolutely tragic. 

I didn’t author the majority opinion in that case. I dissented from the majority’s conclusion, but my dissent suggested that the court should have followed what I viewed as existing law and reject their claims or at least a portion of their claim. 

Yes, sir. 

One, in a tragic, tragic, horrible situation like that, can’t feel anything but personal sense of regret, but those personal senses can’t command a result in a case. As a judge, I serve the greater interest and that greater interest is what the rule of law supplies. As I mentioned in that case, it was fortuitous that there was a remedy and that remedy, as I noted in my case, was Congress and, in fact, very shortly after the second circuit’s opinion, Congress amended the law, giving the victims the remedies that they had sought before the court. And my dissent was just pointing out that despite the great tragedy, that the rule of law commanded a different result. 

I do. 

Well, to the extent that anyone believes that they had been discriminated on the basis of race, that not only violates the law, but one would have—I wouldn’t use the word ‘‘sym-pathy,’’ but one would have a sense that this claim is of some importance and one that the court should very seriously consider.

I’ve been more fortunate than most. The discrimination that I have felt has not been as life-altering as it has for others. But I certainly do understand it, because it is a part of life that I’m familiar with and have seen others suffer so much with, as I have in my situation.

As with all cases where I might have a feeling of some identification with because of background of because of experiences, one feels a sense of understanding what they have experienced. But in that case, as in the TWA case, the ruling that I endorsed against them was required by law.

Clearly, everyone has sympathy for an individual who wants to own their own home. That’s the typical dream and aspiration, I think, of most Americans. And if someone is denied that chance for a reason that they believe is improper, one would recognize and understand their feeling.

Yes, in terms of the part of the claim that we held was barred by the statute of limitation. In a response to the earlier question—to an earlier question, I indicated that the law requires some finality and that’s why Congress passes or a state legislature passes statutes of limitations that require people to bring their claims within certain timeframes. Those are statutes and they must be followed if a situation—if they apply to a particular situation. 

Nobody, including the police officer, was claiming that the speech wasn’t offensive, racist and insulting. There was a question about what his purpose was in sending the letter. But my opinion dissent in that case pointed out that offensiveness and racism of the letter, but I issued a dissent from the majority’s affirmance of his dismissal from the police department because of those letters.

In the situation of that case, that was the decision that I took, because that’s what I believe the law commanded.

I don’t think anyone has sympathy for what was undisputedly a racist statement, but the First Amendment commands that we respect people’s rights to engage in hateful speech.

Reasonable judges look at the same set of facts and may disagree on what those facts should result in. It harkens back to the question of wise men and wise women being judges. Reasonable people disagree. That was my understanding of Judge Newman’s comment in the quotation you made.In immigration cases, we have a different level of review, because it’s not the judge making the decision whether to grant or not grant asylum. It’s an administrative body.And I know that I will—I’m being a little inexact, but I think using old terminology is better than using new terminology. And by that, I mean the agency that most people know as the Bureau of Immigration has a new name now, but that is more descriptive than its new name.

In immigration cases, an asylum-seeker has an opportunity to present his or her case before an immigration judge. They then can appeal to the Bureau of Immigration and argue that there was some procedural default below or that the immigration judge or the bureau itself has committed some error or law.They then are entitled by law to appeal directly to the second circuit. In those cases, because they are administrative decisions, we are required, under the Chevron Doctrine and other tests in administrative law, to give deference to those decisions.But like with all processes, there are occasions when processes are not followed and an appellate court has to ensure that the rights of the asylum-seeker have been—whatever those rights may be—have been given. There are other situations in which an administrative body hasn’t adequately explained its reasoning. There are other situations where administrative bodies have actually applied erroneous law.No institution is perfect. And so that accounts for why, given the deference—and I’m assuming you’re statistic is right, Senator, because I don’t add up the numbers. Okay? But I do know that in immigration cases, the vast majority of the Bureau of Investigationcases are—the petitions for review are denied. So that means that——

I firmly believe in the fidelity to the law. In every case I approach, I start from that working proposition and apply the law to the facts before it.

Never. 

American law does not permit the use of foreign law or international law to interpret the Constitution. That’s a given, and my speech explained that, as you noted, explicitly. There is no debate on that question. There is no issue about that question. The question is a different one, because there are situations in which American law tells you to look at international or foreign law, and my speech was talking to the audience about that. In fact, I pointed out that there are some situations in which courts are commanded by American law to look at what others are doing. So, for example, if the U.S. is a party to a treaty and there’s a question of what the treaty means, then courts routinely look at how other courts of parties who are signatories are interpreting that. There are some U.S. laws that say you have to look at foreign law to determine the issue. So, for example, if two parties havesigned a contract in another country that’s going to be done in that other country, then American law would say you may have to look at that foreign law to determine the contract issue.The question of use of foreign law then is different than considering the idea that it may, on an academic level, provide. Judges— and I’m not using my words. I’m using Justice Ginsberg’s words. You build up your story of knowledge as a person, as a judge, as a human being with everything you read. For judges, that includes law review articles and there are some judges who have opined negatively about that. You use decisions from other courts. You build up your story of knowledge.It is important, in the speech I gave, I noted and agreed with Justices Scalia and Thomas that one has to think about this issue very carefully, because there are so many differences in foreign law from American law. But that was the setting of my speech and the discussion that my speech was addressing.

In fact, I know that in my 17 years on the bench, other than applying it in treaty interpretation or conflicts of law situations, that I have not cited to foreign law.

They are a tool to help you in some situations to interpret what is meant by the words that Congress or a legislature uses.

Yes. Well, foreign law, except in the situation——

It’s often said that I grew up in the shadow of Yankee Stadium. To be more accurate, I grew up sitting next to my dad, while he was alive, watching baseball and it’s one of my fondest memories of him.

I know many residents of Washington, D.C. have asked me to look at the Senators for—— 

That was and people often forget how important some legal challenges seem before judges decide the case. Before the case was decided, all of the academics and all of newspapers and others talking about the case were talking about the novel theory that the baseball owners had developed in challenging the collective bargaining rights of players and owner. In that case, as with all the cases that I approach, I look at what the law is, what precedent says about it, and I try to discern it a new factual challenge how the principles apply, and that’s the process I used in that case. And it became too clear to me, after looking at that case, that that process led to affirming the decision of the National Labor Relationships Board, that it could and should issue an injunction on the grounds that it claimed. So that, too, was a case where there’s a new argument, a new claim, but where the application of the law came from taking the principles of the law and applying it to that new claim. 

I am. 

To me it means that you are guided in reaching decisions in law by the realism of the situation, of the—the— it’s less—it looks at the law through the—— 

It’s not quite words that I would use, because there are many academics and judges who have talked about being legal realists. I don’t apply that label to myself at all. I—as I said, I look at law and—and precedent and discern its principles and apply it to the situation before me. 

No. 

I don’t use labels to describe what I do. There’s been much discussion today about what various labels mean and don’t mean. 

Each person uses those labels and gives it their own sense of what—— 

I think I understood what he was referencing. 

But his use—— 

Well, it means that you look at the Constitution as it’s written, or statutes as is—as they are written and you apply them exactly by the words. 

Again, I don’t use labels. 

And—because—— 

In my understanding, an originalist is someone who looks at what the founding fathers intended and what the situation confronting them was, and you use that to determine every situation presented—not every, but most situations presented by the Constitution. 

The Constitution is a document that is immutable to the sense that it’s lasted 200 years. The Constitution has not changed, except by amendment. It is a process—an amendment process that is set forth in the document. It doesn’t live, other than to be timeless by the expression of what it says. What changes, is society. What changes, is what facts a judge may get presented. 

Well—— 

I don’t know if I can use the word ‘‘change’’. Society changes because there’s been new developments in technology, medicine, in—in society growing. 

There’s—— 

Well, in the last few years? 

I’m sorry. You said the—— 

Roe v. Wade looked at the Constitution and decided that the Constitution, as applied to a claimed right, applied. 

The holding of the court as—— 

The Constitution, in the Fourteenth Amendment, has a—— 

There—the word ‘‘abortion’’ is not used in the Constitution, but the Constitution does have a broad provision concerning a liberty provision under the due process—— 

Certainly, sir. 

I do ask tough questions at oral argument. 

No. No, not at all. I can only explain what I’m doing, which is, when I ask lawyers tough questions, it’s to give them an opportunity to explain their positions on both sides and to persuade me that they’re right. I do know that in the Second Circuit, because we only give litigants 10 minutes of oral argument each, that the processes in the Second Circuit are different than in most other circuits across the country, and that some lawyers do find that our court—which is not just me, but our court generally— is described as a ‘‘hot bench’’. It’s a term of art lawyers use. It means that they’re peppered with questions. Lots of lawyers who are unfamiliar with the process in the Second Circuit find that tough bench difficult and challenging. 

No, sir. I can only talk about what I know of my relationship with the judges of my court and with the lawyers who appear regularly from our Circuit. And I believe that my rep-utation is—is such that I ask the hard questions, but I do it evenly for both sides.

Yes.

I do understand how those words could be taken that way, particularly if read in isolation.

It does. And I would hope that we’ve come, in America, to the place where we can look at a statement that could be misunderstood and consider it in the context of the person’s life and the work we have done.

My entire life. 

It was the most horrific experience of my personal life, and the most horrific experience in imagining the pain of the families of victims of that tragedy. 

I’ve followed the newspaper accounts, I’ve read some books in the area. So, I believe I have an understanding of that—— 

I understand that some of them have indicated that women are not equal to men. 

We are, sir. We have—we have tens and thousands of soldiers in the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. We are at war.

No, no, no, no. I—I’m thinking, because I’ve never practiced in the area. I’ve only read the Supreme Court decisions in this area.

I’ve obviously examined, by referencing cases, some of the procedures involved in military law. But I—I’m not personally familiar with military law. 

I haven’t participated. 

Given the announcements of certain groups and the messages that have been sent with videotapes, et cetera, announcing that intent, then the answer would be on—based on that, yes. 

I—it’s difficult to answer that question in the abstract, for the reason that I indicated later. I’ve not been a student of the law of war. 

Other than to—— 

Senator—— 

It was then. I think it—I—I know it has changed names recently.

Nearly 12 years. 

If not 12 years. 

The Fund was involved in litigations. I was a board member of the Fund. 

No. I never reviewed those briefs. 

I wasn’t aware of what was said in those briefs. Perhaps it might be helpful if I explain what the function of a board member is and what the function of the staff would be in an organization like the Fund. 

In a small organization, as the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund was back then, it wasn’t the size of—of other Legal Defense Funds, like the NAACP Legal Defense Fund—— 

Our mission—— 

Our mission statement was broad like the Constitution. 

Which meant that it—its focus was on promoting the equal opportunities of Hispanics in the United States. 

I wasn’t, and I didn’t as a board member, review those briefs. Our lawyers were charged with——

Well, I know that the Fund, during the years I was there, was involved in public health issues as it affected the Latino community. It was involved—— 

Well, it was certainly viewed that way generally by a number of civil rights organizations at the time. 

It wasn’t a question of whether I personally viewed it that way or not. The issue was whether the law was settled on what issues the Fund was advocating on behalf of the community it represented. And—— 

And so the question would become, was there a good-faith basis for whatever arguments they were making, as the Fund’s lawyers were lawyers. 

They had an ethical obligation. 

The issue for me with respect to the death penalty is that the Supreme Court, since Gregg, has determined that the death penalty is constitutional under certain situations. 

I have rejected challenges to the Federal law and it’s application in the one case I handled as a District Court judge, but it’s a reflection of what my views are on the law. 

I never litigated a death penalty case personally. The Fund—— 

I send the memorandum for the board to take under consideration what position, on behalf of the Latino community, the Fund should take on New York State reinstating the death penalty in the State. You—it’s hard to remember because so much time has passed in the 30 years since I—— 

An advocate advocates on behalf of the client they have, and so that’s a different situation than how a judge has acted in the cases before him or her.

Thank you, sir. 

Hello, Senator. Thank you. And I thank you again for letting me use your conference room when I was as hobbled as I was. 

With respect to the position the fund took in 1980–1981 with respect to the death penalty, that was, as I noted,a question of being an advocate and expressing views on behalf of the community on a policy choice New York State was making: Should we or should we not reinstitute the death penalty?As a judge, what I have to look at and realize is that in 30 years or 40, actually, there has been—excuse me, Senator. I’m sorry——

In the Heatley case, it was the first prosecution in the Southern District of New York of a death penalty case in over 40 years. Mr. Heatley was charged with being a gang leader of a crack and cocaine enterprise who engaged in over—if the number wasn’t 13, it was very close to that—13 murders to promote that enterprise.He did challenge the application of the death penalty, charges against him, on the ground that the prosecutor had made its decision to prosecute him and refused him a cooperation agreement on the basis of his race.The defense counsel, much as you have Senator, raised any number of concerns about the application of the death penalty and in response to his argument, I held hearings not on that question, but on the broader question of what had—on the specific legal question—what had motivated this prosecutor to enter this prosecution and whether he was denied the agreement he sought on the basis of race. I determined that that was not the case and rejected his challenge.With respect to the issues of concerns about the application of the death penalty, I noted for the defense attorneys that, in the first instance, one back question of the effects of the death penalty, how it should be done, what circumstances warrant it or don’t in terms of the law, that that’s a legislative question.And, in fact, I said to him—I acknowledged his concerns, I acknowledged that many had expressed views about that, but that’s exactly what I said, which is, ‘‘I can only look at the case that’s before me and decide that case.’’

The court is not a legislative body. It is a reviewing body of whether a particular act by a state in a particular case is constitutional or not.In a particular situation, the court may conclude that the state has acted unconstitutionally and invalidate the act. But it’s difficult to answer a question about the role of the court outside of the functions of the court, which is we don’t make broad policies. We decide questions based on cases and the principles implicated by that particular case before you.

It’s so unsatisfying, I know, for you and probably the other Senators, when a nominee to the court doesn’t engage directly with the societal issues that are so important to you, both as citizens and Senators. And I know they are important to you, because this very question you just mentioned to me is part of bipartisan efforts that you’re making, and I respect that many have concerns on lots of different issues.For me, as a judge, both on the circuit or potentially as a nominee to the Supreme Court, my role is a very different one. And in the Louis Gomez case, we weren’t talking about the disparity. We were talking about the quantity of drug and whether I had to follow the law on the statutory minimum that Congress required for the weight of drugs at issue.In expressing a recognition of the family’s situation and the uniqueness of that case, it was at a time when Congress had not recognized the safety valve for first-time offenders under the drug laws. That situation had motivated many judges in many situations to comment on the question of whether the law should be changed to address the safety valve question, then make a statement, making any suggestions to Congress, I followed the law.But I know that the attorney general’s office, many people spoke to Congress on this issue and Congress passed a safety valve.With respect to the crack-cocaine disparity, as you may know, the guidelines are no longer mandatory as a result of a series of recent Supreme Court—not so recent, but Supreme Court cases probably almost in the last 10 years. I think the first one, Apprendi, was in 2000, if my memory is serving me right, or very close to that.At any rate, that issue was addressed recently by the Supreme Court in a case called U.S. v. Kimbro and the court noted that the Sentencing Commission’s recommendation of sentences was not based on its considered judgment that the 100-to-1 ratio was an appropriate sentence for this conduct and the court recognized that sentencing judges could take that fact into consideration in fashioning an individual sentence for a defendant.And, in fact, the Sentencing Commission, in very recent time, has permitted defendants who have been serving prior sentences, in certain situations, to come back to court and have the courts reconsider whether their sentences should be reduced in a way speci-fied under the procedures established by the Sentencing Commission.This is an issue that I can’t speak further about, because it is an issue that’s being so actively discussed by Congress and which is controlled by law. But as I said, I can appreciate why not saying more would feel unsatisfying, but I am limited by the role I have.

There’s been 4 years since Judge Posner’s comments and they have to be placed somewhat in perspective. Attorney General Ashcroft’s—what you described as streamlining procedures have been by, I think, all of the circuit courts that have addressed the issue, affirmed and given Chevron deference.So the question is not whether the streamlined procedures are constitutional or not, but what happened when he instituted that procedure is that, with all new things, there were many imperfections. New approaches to things create new challenges and there’s no question that courts faced with large numbers of immigration cases, as was the second circuit—I think we had the second largest number of new cases that arrived at our doorsteps, the ninth circuit being the first, and I know the seventh had a quite significantly large number—were reviewing processes that, as Justice Alito said, left something to be desired in a number of cases.I will say that that onslaught of cases and the concerns expressed in a number of cases by the judges, in the dialog that goes on in court cases, with administrative bodies, with Congress, re-sulted in more cooperation between the courts and the immigration officials in how to handle these cases, how to ensure that the process would be improved.I know that the attorney general’s office devoted more resources to the handling of these cases. There’s always room for improvement. The agency is handling so many matters, so many cases, has so many responsibilities, making sure that it has adequate resources and training is an important consideration, again, in the first instance, by Congress, because you set the budget.In the end, what we can only do is ensure that due process is applied in each case, according to the law required for the review of ths cases.

Well, I wouldn’t—I’m not endorsing his views, because he can only speak for himself. I do know that in, I would say, the last two or 3 years, the number of cases questioning the processes in published circuit court decisions has decreased.

Thank you. 

Good morning, Senator. It’s good to see youagain.(325)

Yes, generally, but the point I was making was that Justice O’Connor’s words, the ones that I was using as a platform to make my point about the value of experience generally in the legal system, was that her words literally and mine literally made no sense, at least not in the context of what judges do or— what judges do.I didn’t and don’t believe that Justice O’Connor intended to suggest that when two judges disagree, one of them has to be unwise. And if you read her literal words that wise old men and wise old women would come to the same decisions in cases, that’s what the words would mean. But that’s clearly not what she meant. And if you listen to my words, it would have the same suggestion, that only Latinos would come to wiser decisions. But that wouldn’t make sense in the context of my speech either, because I pointed out in the speech that eight, nine white men had decided Brownv. Board of Education. And I noted in a separate paragraph of the speech that no one person speaks in the voice of any group.So my rhetorical flourish, just like hers, can’t be read literally. It had a different meaning in the context of the entire speech.

It is clear from the attention that my words have gotten and the manner in which it has been understood by some people that my words failed. They didn’t work. The message that the entire speech attempted to deliver, however, remains the message that I think Justice O’Connor meant, the message that prior nominees including Justice Alito meant when he said that his Italian ancestry he considers when he’s hearing discrimination cases. I don’t think he meant, I don’t think Justice O’Connor meant that personal experiences compel results in any way. I think life experiences generally, whether it’s that I’m a Latina or was a State prosecutor or have been a commercial litigator or been a trial judge and an appellate judge, that the mixture of all of those things, the amalgam of them, helped me to listen and understand. But all of us understand, because that’s the kind of judges we have proven ourselves to be, we rely on the law to command the results in the case.So when one talks about life experiences and even in the context of my speech, my message was different than I understand my words have been understood by some.

I stand by the words. It fell flat. And I understand that some people have understood them in a way that I never intended and I would hope that in the context of the speech that they would be understood.

I would regret that because for me the work I do with students—and it’s just not in the context of those six speeches. As you know, I give dozens more speeches to students all the time, and to lawyers of all backgrounds, and I give—and have spoken to community groups of all types. And what I do in each of those situations is to encourage both students and, as I did when I spoke to new immigrants that I was admitting as students, to try to encourage them to participate on all levels of our society. I tell people that that’s one of the great things about America, that we can do so many different things and participate so fully in all of the opportunities America presents. And so the message that I de-liver repeatedly as the context of all of my speeches is: I have made it. So can you. Work hard at it. Pay attention to what you’re doing and participate.

The title of that speech was ‘‘Returning Majesty to the Law.’’ As I hope I communicated in my opening remarks, I’m passionate about the practice of law and judging, passionate in the sense of respecting the rule of law so much, the speech was given in the context of talking to young lawyers and saying, ‘‘Don’t participate in the cynicism that people express about our legal system.’’ I—— 

And I was encouraging them not to fall into the trap of calling decisions that the public disagrees with, as they sometimes do, ‘‘activism’’ or using other labels; but to try to be more engaged in explaining the law and the process of law to the public. And in the context of the words that you quoted to me, I pointed out to them explicitly about evolving social changes, that what I was referring to is Congress is passing new laws all the time, and so whatever was viewed as settled law previously will often get changed because Congress has changed something. I also spoke about the fact that society evolves in terms of technology and other developments, and so the law is being applied to a new set of facts. In terms of talking about different approaches in law, I was talking about the fact that there are some cases that are viewed as radical, and I think I mentioned just one case, Brown v. Board of Education, and explaining and encouraging them to explain that process, too. And there are new directions in the law in terms of the Court. The Court, the Supreme Court, is often looking at its precedents and considering whether in certain circumstances—because precedent is owed deference for very important reasons. But the Court takes a new direction, and those new directions rarely, if ever, come at the initiation of the Court. They come because lawyers are encouraging the Court to look at a situation in a new way, to consider it in a different way. What I was telling those young lawyers is, ‘‘Don’t play into people’s skepticism about the law. Look to explain to them the process.’’ I also, when I was talking about returning majesty to the law, I spoke to them about what judges can do, and I talked about, in the second half of that speech, that we had an obligation to ensure that we were monitoring the behavior of lawyers before us so that when questionable ethical or other conduct could bring disrepute tothe legal system, that we monitor our lawyers, because that would return a sense——

They change—we can’t change law. We’re not lawmakers. But we change our view of how to interpret certain laws based on new facts, new developments of doctrinal theory, considerations of whether—what the reliance of society may be in an old rule. We think about whether a rule of law has proven workable. We look at how often the Court has affirmed a prior understanding of how to approach an issue. But in those senses, there’s changes by judges in the popular perception that we’re changing the law.

It’s not that it’s important to the law as much as it is that it’s what legal cases are about. People bring cases to courts because they believe that precedents don’t clearly answer the fact situation that they are presenting in their individual case. That creates uncertainty. That’s why people bring cases. And they say, Look, the law says this, but I’m entitled to that. I have this set of facts that entitle me to relief under the law.It’s the entire process of law. If law was always clear, we wouldn’t have judges. It’s because there is indefiniteness not in what the law is, but its application to new facts that people sometimes feel it’s unpredictable. That speech, as others I’ve given, is an attempt to encourage judges to explain to the public more of the process.The role of judges is to ensure that they are applying the law to those new facts, that they’re interpreting that law with Congress’ intent, being informed by what precedents say about the law and Congress’ intent and applying it to the new facts.But that’s what the role of the courts is, and obviously, the public is going to become impatient with that if they don’t understand that process. And I’m encouraging lawyers to do more work in explaining the system, in explaining what we are doing as courts.

I was talking just about that. There are in the law—there have been upheld in certain situations that certain job positions have a requirement for a certain amount of strength or other characteristics that maybe a person who fits that characteristic can have that job. But there are differences that may affect a particular type of work. We do that all the time. You need to——

No, no, no, no. What I was talking about there, because the context of that was talking about the difference in the process of judging, and the process of judging for me is what life experiences bring to the process. It helps you listen and understand. It doesn’t change what the law is or what the law commands. A life experience as a prosecutor may help me listen and understand an argument in a criminal case. It may have no relevancy to what happens in an antitrust suit. It’s just a question of the process of judging. It improves both the public’s confidence that there are judges from a variety of different backgrounds on the bench, because they feel that all issues will be more—better at least addressed—not that it’s better addressed, but that it helps that process of feeling confidence that all arguments are going to be listened to and understood. 

I’m not sure—I’m not sure exactly where that would play out, but I was asking a hypothetical question in that paragraph. I was saying, look we just don’t know. If you read the entire part of that speech, what I was saying is let’s ask the question. That’s what all of these studies are doing. Ask the question if there’s a difference. Ignoring things and saying, you know, it doesn’t happen isn’t an answer to a situation. It’s consider it. Consider it as a possibility and think about it. But I certainly wasn’t intending to suggest that there would be a difference that affected the outcome. I talked about there being a possibility that it could affect the process of judging. 

Yes. It is absolutely correct. I was asked no question by anyone, including the President, about my views on any specific legal issue.

No, sir, because you just have to look at my record to know that in the cases that I addressed, on all issues I follow the law.

I have no idea, since I know for a fact I never spoke to him about my views on abortion, frankly, my views on any social issue. George was the head partner of my firm, but our contact was not on a daily basis. I have no idea why he’s drawing that conclusion because if he looked at my record, I have ruled according to the law in all cases addressed to the issue of the termination of abortion rights—of women’s right to terminate their pregnancy, and I voted in cases in which I have upheld the application of the Mexico City policy, which was a policy in which the government was not funding certain abortion-related activities.

If he was talking about the fact that I served on a particular board that promoted equal opportunity for people, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, then you could talk about that being a liberal instinct in the sense that I promote equal opportunity in America and the attempts to ensure that. But he has not read my jurisprudence for 17 years, I can assure you. He’s a corporate litigator, and my experience with corporate litigators is that they only look at the law when it affects the case before them.[Laughter.] 

Senator, I can’t speak to what brought this case to Judge Cabranes’ attention. I can say the following, however: When parties are dissatisfied with a panel decision, they can file a petition for rehearing en banc. And, in fact, that’s what happened in the Ricci case. Those briefs are routinely reviewed by judges, and so publishing by summary order—or addressing an issue by summary order or by published opinion doesn’t hide a party’s claims from other judges. They get the petitions for rehearing.Similarly, parties, when they are dissatisfied with what a circuit has done, file petitions for certiorari, which is a request for the Supreme Court to review a case, and so the Court looks at that as well. And so regardless of how a circuit decided a case, it’s not a question of hiding it from others.With respect to the broader question that you are raising, which is why do you do it by summary order or why do you do it in a published opinion or in a per curiam, the question—or the practice is that about 75 percent of circuit court decisions are decided by summary order, in part because we can’t handle the volume of our work if we were writing long decisions in every case; but, more importantly, because not every case requires a long opinion if a district court opinion has been clear and thorough on an issue. And in this case, there was a 78-page decision by the district court. It adequately explained the question that the Supreme Court addressed and reviewed.And so to the extent that a particular panel considers that an issue has been decided by existing precedent, that’s a question that the court above can obviously revisit, as it did in Ricci, where it looked at it and said, well, we understand what the circuit did, we understand what existing law is, but we should be looking at this question in a new way. That’s the job of the Supreme Court. I would——

As you know, the court’s opinion, issued after discussions en banc, recognized, as I do, the hardship that the firefighters experienced. That’s not been naysayed by anyone.The issue before the court was a different one, and the one that the district court addressed was what decision the decision makers made, not what people behind the scenes wanted the decision makers to make, but what they were considering. And what they were considering was the state of the law at the time. And in an attempt to comply with what they believed the law said and what the panel recognized as what the Second Circuit precedent said, that they made a choice under that existing law.The Supreme Court in its decision set a new standard by which an employer and lower court should review what the employer is doing by the substantial evidence test. That test was not discussed with the panel. It wasn’t part of the arguments below. That was a decision by the Court, borrowing from other areas of the law and saying we think this would work better in this situation.

That’s a great invitation, and good morning, Senator. You can assure your Baltimore fans that I have been to Camden Yards. It’s a beautiful stadium. 

I thank those who have commented in the way they did. I think that most lawyers who participate in argument before me know how engaged I become in their arguments and trying to understand them. And as I indicated yesterday, thatcan appear tough to some people, because active engagement can sometimes feel that way.But my style is to engage as much as I can so I can ensure myself that I understand what a party is intending to tell me. I am, in terms of what I do, always interested in understanding, and so that will make me an active participant in argument.As I noted yesterday, I have colleagues who never ask questions. There are some judges on the Supreme Court who rarely ask questions and others ask a lot of questions. Judges approach issues in different ways, with different styles, and mine happens to be on one end of the style and others choose others.

When we speak about my passion, I don’t think that the issue of guaranteeing each citizen the right to vote is unique to me or that it’s different among any Senator or among any group of people who are Americans.It is a fundamental right and it is one that you’ve recognized, Congress has addressed for decades and has done an amazing job in passing a wide variety of statutes in an effort to protect that right.The question that a court would face in any individual situation is whether an act of Congress conflicts with some right of either the state or an individual with respect to the issue of voting. There could be other challenges raised on a wide variety of different bases, but each case would present its own unique circumstance.There is one case involving the Voting Rights Act where I addressed the issue of the right to vote and in that case, I issued a dissent on an en banc ruling by my court. For the public who may not understand what en banc ruling means, when the whole court is considering an issue.In that case, if it wasn’t 13, it may have been 12 members of the court, we’re a complement of 13 judges, but I, right now, can’t remember if we were a full complement at the time, considering an issue. The majority upheld a state regulation barring a group of people from voting.I dissented on a very short opinion, one-paragraph opinion, saying, ‘‘These are the words of Congress in the statute it passed, and the words are that no state may impose a—and I’m paraphrasing it now. I’m not trying to read the statute, but no condition or restriction on voting that denies or abridges the right to vote on the basis of race.I noted that given the procedural posture of that case, that the plaintiff had alleged that that’s exactly what the state was doing, and I said that’s the allegation on the complaint. That’s what a judge has to accept on the face of the complaint. We’ve got to give him a chance to prove that, and that, to me, was the end of the story.To the extent that the majority believed that—and there was a lot of discussion among the variety of different opinions in the case as to whether this individual could or could not prove his allegation and there was a suggestion by both sides that he might never be able to do it.My point was a legal one. These are Congress’ words. We have to take them at their word. And if there’s an end result of this process that we don’t like, then we have to leave that to Congress to address that issue. We can’t fix it by ruling against what I viewed as the express words of Congress.

I believe my cases, my entire record shows that I look at the acts of Congress, as I think the Supreme Court does, with deference, because that is the bedrock of our constitutional system, which is that each branch has a different set of constitutional powers; that deference must be given to the rights of each branch in each situation; that it is exercising its powers; and, to the extent that the court has a role, because it does have a role, to ensuring that the Constitution is followed, it attempts to do that.When I say ‘‘attempt,’’ but it always attempts it with a recognition of the deference it owes to the elected branches in terms of setting policy and making law.

Your comments about your daughter and granddaughter makes me remember a letter I received when I was being nominated to the circuit court. It was from a woman who said she had 19 daughters and grandchildren and how much pride she took in knowing that a woman could serve on a court like the second circuit.And I realized then how important the diversity of the bench is to making people feel and understand the great opportunity American provides to all its citizens, and that has value. That’s clear.With respect to the issue of the question of what role diversity serves in the society, it harkens back almost directly to your previous question. I’ve been overusing that word ‘‘harkens,’’ sorry. It almost comes around to your earlier question, which is that issue is one that starts with the legislative branches and the government, the executive bodies, and employers who look at their workforce, that look at the opportunities in society, and make policy decisions about what promotes that equal opportunity in the first instance.The court then looks at what they have done and determines whether that action is constitutional or not. And with respect at least to the education field, in a very recent set of cases, the Supreme Court looked at the role of diversity in educational decisions as to which students they would admit, and the court upheld the University of Michigan’s law school admissions policy, which would—because the school believed that it needed to promote as wide a body and diverse a body of students to ensure that life perspectives, that the experience of students would be as fulsome as they wished.And they used race there as one of many factors, but not one that compelled individual choices of the student. The court upheld that. And Justice O’Connor, in the opinion she wrote, authored, expressed the hope that in 25 years, race wouldn’t even need to be considered.In a separate case, the University of Michigan’s undergraduate admissions policy, the court struck that down and it struck it down because it viewed the use of race as a form of impermissible quota, because it wasn’t based on an individual assessment of the people applying, but as an impermissible violation of the equal protection clause and of the law.These situations are always looked at individually and, as I said, in the context of the choices that Congress, the executive branch, an employer is making and the interest that it’s asserting and the remedy that it’s creating to address the interest it’s trying to protect. All of that is an individual question for the courts.

Well, it depends on the context of the case that you’re looking at. In the Gant case, for example, there were a variety of different challenges brought by the plaintiff to the conduct that was alleged the school had engaged in. I joined the majority in dismissing some of the claims as not consistent with law.But in that case, there was a disparate treatment element and I pointed out to the set of facts that showed or presented evidenceof that disparate treatment. That’s the quote that the quote that you were reading from, that this was a sole child who was treated completely different than other children of a different race in the services that he was provided with and in the opportunities he was given to remedy or to receive remedial help.That is obviously different, because what you’re looking at is the law as it exists and the promise that the law makes to every citizen of equal treatment in that situation.

The right to privacy has been recognized, as you know, in a wide variety of circumstances for more than probably 90 years now, close to 100. That is a part of the court’s precedence in applying the immutable principles of the Constitution, the liberty provision of the due process clause, and recognizing that that provides a right to privacy in a variety of different settings. You have mentioned that line of cases and there are many others in which the court has recognized that as a right.In terms of the coming century, it’s guided by those cases, because those cases provide the courts precedence and framework, and with other cases, to look at how we will consider a new challenge to a new law or to a new situation.That’s what precedent’s do. They provide a framework. The Constitution remains the same. Society changes. The situations it brings before courts change, but the principles are the words of the Constitution guided by how precedence gives—or has applied those principles to each situation and then you take that and you look at the new situation.

I know that there’s been a lot of attention paid to one speech and its variants that I’ve given. If you look at the body of my speeches, public service and pro bono work is probably the main topic I speak at—I speak about.Virtually every graduation speech I give to law students, speeches I’ve given to new immigrants being sworn in as citizens, to community groups of all types is the importance of participation in bettering the conditions of our society, active involvement in our communities.It doesn’t have to be active involvement in politics. I tell people that. Just get involved in your community, work on your school boards, work in your churches, work in your community to improve it.The issue of public service is a requirement under the code of the American Bar Association. Virtually every state has a requirement that lawyers participate in public service in some way. I have given multiple speeches in which I’ve talked to law school bodies and said, ‘‘Make sure your students don’t leave your school without understanding the critical importance of public service in what they do as lawyers.’’In that, we are in full agreement, Senator. To me, that’s a core responsibility of lawyering. Our founding fathers, they became what they became, our founding fathers, because of their fundamental belief of involvement in their society and public service, and it’s, to me, a spirit that is the charge of the legal profession, because that’s what we do, we help people; in a different way than doctors do, but helping people receive justice under the law is a critical importance of our work.

I can speak to what the court has said in its precedent. In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the court reaffirmed the court holding of Roe v. Wade that a woman has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy in certain circumstances. In Casey, the court announced that in reviewing state regulations that may apply to that right, that the court considers whether that regulation has an undue burden on the woman’s constitutional right. That is my understanding of what the state of the law is. 

I can’t answer that question in the abstract because I would have to look at what the state of the state’s law was on that question and what the state said with respect to that issue. I can say that the question of the number of weeks that a woman is pregnant has been approached to looking at a woman’s act as was changed by Casey. The question is is the state regulation regulating what a woman does an undue burden. And so I can’t answeryour hypothetical because I can’t look at it as an abstract without knowing what state laws exist on this issue or not.And even if I knew that, I probably couldn’t opine because I’m sure that situation might well arise before the court.

The law has answered a different question. It has talked about the constitutional right of women. 

In certain circumstances. As I indicated, the issue becomes one of what is the state regulation in any particular circumstance. 

I can’t answer that in the abstract because the question as it would come before me wouldn’t be in the way that you form it as a citizen. It would come to me as a judge in the context of some action that someone is taking, whether if it is the state, the state, if it is a private citizen being controlled by the state challenging that action. Those issues are—— 

All I can say to you is what the court has done. 

And the standard that the court has applied, what factors it may or may not look at within a particular factual situation can’t be predicted in a way to say yes, absolutely, that’s going to be considered. No, this won’t be considered. 

I can’t because that’s not a question that the court reaches out to answer. That is a question that gets created by a state regulation of some sort or an action by the state that may or may not according to some claimant, place an undue burden on her. We don’t make policy choices in the court. We look at the case before us with the interests that are argued by the parties, look at our precedent and try to apply its principles to the arguments parties are raising. 

It depends on what they are applying that definition to. So there are situations in which they might and situations where that definition would or would not have applicability to the dispute before the court.All state action is looked at within the context of what the state is attempting to do and what liabilities it is imposing.

As I said, it depends on in what context they are attempting to do that.

No, sir. 

In the Supreme Court’s decision in Heller, it recognized an individual rights to bear arms as a right guaranteed by the second amendment, an important right, and one that limited the actions the Federal Government could take with respect to the position of firearms. In that case we are talking about handguns. The Maloney case presented a different question. That was whether that individual right would limit the activities that states could do to regulate the possession of firearms. That question is addressed by a legal doctrine. That legal doctrine uses the word fundamental, but it doesn’t have the same meaning that common people understand that wordto me. To most people the word by its dictionary term is critically important, central, fundamental, it is sort of rock basis.Those meanings are not how the law uses that term when it comes to what the states can do or not do. The term has a very specific legal meaning which means is that amendment of the Constitution incorporated against the states.

And others. But generally, and I shouldn’t say and others, through the 14th. The question becomes whether and how that amendment to the Constitution, that protection, applies or limits the states to act. In Maloney, the issue for us was a very narrow one. We recognized that Heller held, and it is the law of the land right now in the sense of precedent that there is an individual right to bear arms as it applies to Federal Government regulation. The question in Maloney was different for us. Was that right incorporated against the states. We determined that given Supreme Court precedent, a precedent that had addressed that precise question and said it is not, so it wasn’t fundamental in that legal doctrine sense, that was the court’s holding. 

Well, they failed to rule on it, you’re right. But I—— 

I agree. 

It is not how I see the law. 

No, it’s not my interpretation. I was applying both Supreme Court precedent deciding that question and Second Circuit precedent that had directly answered that question and said it’s not incorporated. The issue of whether or not it should be is a different question, and that is the question that the Supreme Court may take up. In fact, in his opinion, Justice Scalia suggested it should, but it is not what I believe. It is what the law has said about it. 

I can’t answer the question of incorporation other than to refer to precedent. Precedent says—— 

And by that, I mean what the court will look at is a state regulation of your right and then determine can the state do that or not. So even once you recognize a right, you are always considering what the state is doing to limit or expand that right and then decide is that Okay constitutionally. 

One of the frustrations with judges and their decisions by citizens is that, and this was an earlier response to Senator Cornyn. What we do is different than the conversation that the public has about what it wants the law to do. We don’t, judges, make law. What we do is we get a particular set of facts presented to us, we look at what those facts are, what in the case of different constitutional amendments is, what states are deciding to do or not do, and then look at the Constitution and see what it says and attempt to take its words and the principles and the precedents that have described those principles and apply them to the facts before you. In discussing the Second Amendment as it applied to the Federal Government, Justice Scalia noted that there had been long regulations by many states on a variety of different issues related to the possession of guns.He wasn’t suggesting that all regulation was unconstitutional. He was holding in that case that DC’s particular regulation was illegal.As you know, there are many states that prohibit felons from possessing guns. So does the Federal Government. So it’s not that we make a broad policy choice and say this is what we want, what judges do. What we look at is what other actors in the system are doing, what their interest in doing it is and how that fits to whatever situation they think they have to fix, what Congress or state legislature has to fix.All of that is the court’s function. So I can’t explain it philosophically. I can only explain it by its setting and what the function of judging is about.

I’m trying to think if I remember a case where the Supreme Court has addressed that particular question. Is there a constitutional right to self-defense? I can’t think of one. I could be wrong, but I can’t think of one.Generally, as I understand, most criminal law statutes are passed by states. I’m also trying to think if there is any Federal law that includes a self-defense provision or not. I just can’t.What I was attempting to explain is the issue of self-defense is usually defined in criminal statutes by the state’s laws. I would think, although I haven’t studied all of the state’s laws. I’m intimately familiar with New York.

As I said, I don’t know. I don’t know if that legal question has been ever presented.

But that is sort of an abstract question with no particular meaning to me outside of——

I know it’s difficult to deal with someone like a judge who is so sort of—whose thinking is so cornered by law.

Could I—— 

That’s exactly right. But let me try to address what you are saying in the context that I can, which is what I have experience with, which is New York criminal law because I was a former prosecutor. I am talking in very broad terms, but under New York law, if you are being threatened with imminent death or very serious injury, you can use force to repel that. That would be legal. The question that would come up and does come up before juries and judges is how imminent is the threat? If the threat was in this room, I’m going to come get you and you go home and get, or I go home, I don’t want to suggest I am by the way. Please, I don’t want anybody to misunderstand what I’m trying to say. If I go home, get a gun, come back and shoot you, that may not be legal under New York law because you would have alternative ways to defend—— 

I’d be in a lot of trouble then. But I couldn’t do that under a definition of self-defense. So that is what I was trying to explain in terms of why in looking at this as a judge, I’m thinking about how that question comes up and how the answer can differ so radically given the hypothetical facts before you. 

I have actually agreed with Justice Scalia and Thomas on the point that one has to be very cautious even in using foreign law with respect to the things American law permits you to. That is in treaty interpretation or in conflicts of law because it is a different system of law. 

My speech and my record on this issue, because I have never used it to interpret the Constitution or to interpret American statute is that there is none. My speech has made that very clear.

Unless the statute requires you or directs you to look at foreign law, and some do by the way, the answer is no. Foreign law cannot be used as a holding or a precedent or to bind or to influence the outcome of a legal decision interpreting the Constitution or American law that doesn’t direct you to that law.

There is none. If you look at my speech, you will see that repeatedly I pointed out both that the American legal system was structured not to use foreign law, it repeatedly underscored that foreign law could not be used as a holding as precedent or to interpret the Constitution of the statute.What I pointed out to in that speech is that there is a public misunderstanding of the word use. What I was talking about, one doesn’t use those things in the sense of coming to a legal conclusion in a case.What judges do, and I cited Justice Ginsburg, is educate themselves. They build up a story of knowledge about legal thinking, about approaches that one might consider. But that is just thinking. It’s an academic discussion when you’re talking about thinking about ideas. Then it is how most people think about the citation of foreign law in a decision.They assume that if there is a citation to foreign law, that is driving the conclusion. In my experience when I have seen other judges cite foreign law, they are not using it to drive the conclusion, they are using just to point something out about a comparison between American law or foreign law. But they are not using it in the sense of compelling a result.

We don’t render decisions to please the home crowd or any other crowd. I know that because I have heard speeches by a number of Justices, that in the past, Justices have indicated that the Supreme Court hasn’t taken many treaty cases, that maybe it should think about doing that because we are not participating in the discussion among countries on treaty positions that are ambiguous.That may be a consideration to some Justices. Some have expressed that as a consideration. My point is you don’t rule to please any crowd. You rule to get the law right under its terms.

I can. That’s the pledge I would take if I was—that I took as a district court judge, as a circuit court judge, and if I am honored to be confirmed by this body, that I would take as a Supreme Court Justice, yes. 

That’s correct. 

I was. 

No, because most of us on the board didn’t have civil rights experience. I had actually—when I was a prosecutor in private practice, that wasn’t my specialty of law. Even if they tried to show it to me, I don’t know that I could have made a legal judgment even if I tried. That was not our function. 

I don’t believe any question was asked about my service on the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. The fund is an organization that has and has been considered in the mainstream of civil rights organizations like the NAACP and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, promotes the civil rights of its community. 

Like you, I am—and perhaps because I was a State prosecutor and I have been a trial judge, and so I’ve had very extensive experience with jury trials in the American criminal law context. I have had less in the civil law context as a private practitioner, but much more as a district court judge.I can understand why our Founding Fathers believed in the system of juries. I have found in my experience with juries that virtually every juror I have ever dealt with, after having experienced the process, came away heartened, more deeply committed to the fundamental importance of their role as citizens in that process. Every juror I ever dealt with showed great attention to what was going on, took their responsibilities very seriously.I had a juror who was in the middle of deliberations, on her way to my courtroom—not on her way to my courtroom—on her way home from court on the previous day broke her leg, was in the hospital the entire night, came back the next morning on time, in a wheelchair, with a cast that went up to her hip. What a testament both to that woman and to the importance of jury service to our citizens. I was very active in ensuring that her service was recognized by our court.It has a central role. Its importance to remember is that it hasn’t been fully incorporated against the States. Many States limit jury trials in different ways. And so the question of what cases require a jury trial and what don’t is still somewhat within the discretion of States. But it is a very important part of a sense of protection for defendants accused in criminal cases, and one that I personally value from my experience with it.

Senator, I—as I see the jury system, I don’t know exactly—I don’t actually—and I’ve read the Federalist Papers and I’ve read other historical accounts. The jury system was—I thought the basic premise of it was to ensure that a person subject to criminal liability would have a group of his or her peers pass judgment on whether that individual had violated the law or not.To the extent that the Constitution looked to the courts to determine whether a particular act was or was not constitutional, it seems to me that that was a different function than what the jury was intended to serve. The jury, as I understood it, was to ensure that a person’s guilt or innocence was determined by a group of peers. To the extent that that has a limit on the elected branches, it’s to ensure that someone is prosecuted under the law and that the law is applied to them in the way that the law is written and intended.

Yes. 

The Constitution by its terms sets forth the powers and limits of each branch of Government, and so to the ex-tent that are limits recognized in the Constitution, that is really what the Constitution intends. The Bill of Rights, the Amendments set forth there are often viewed as limits on Government action. And so it’s a question always of looking at what the Constitution says and what kind of scope it is for a Government action at issue.

The best framework that has been set out on this question of a unilateral act by one branch or another—but usually the challenge is raised when the Executive is doing something, because the Executive executes the law, takes the action, typically. The best description of how to approach those questions was done by Justice Jackson in his concurring opinion in the Youngstown case. And that opinion laid out a framework that generally is applied to all questions of Executive action, which is that you have to look at the powers of each branch together. You have to start with what has Congress said, express or implicitly. And if it’s authorized to do something, to let the President do something, then the President’s acting at the height of his powers. If Congress has implicitly prohibited—expressly or implicitly prohibited something, then the President’s acting at the lowest ebb of his powers.There is a zone of twilight, which is the zone in between, which is: Has Congress said something or not said something?In all of the situations, once you’ve looked at what Congress has done or not done, you then are directed to look at what the President’s powers may be under the Constitution minus whatever powers Congress has in that area. So the whole exercise is really, in terms of Congress and the Executive, an exercise of the two working together. And, in fact, that’s the basic structure of our system of Government. That’s why Congress makes the laws. The President can veto them, but he can’t make them. He can regulate if the Congress gives him the authority to do so, and within other delegated authorities or—I shouldn’t use the word ‘‘delegated’’ because it has a legal meaning. But the point is that that question is always looked at in light of what Congress has said on the issue and in light of Congress’ power as specified in the Constitution.

I think, as I understand your question, Senator, that there are two issues—if not more, but the two that I note as more starkly for me in your question is the one of the search and seizure and the Fourth Amendment as it applies to taking evidence from an individual and use it against him or her in a current proceeding.

That is the structure. Not so long ago, the Supreme Court dealt with a technologically new situation, which was whether an individual had a right to expect a warrant to be gotten before law enforcement flew over his or—I think it was a ‘‘his’’ in that case—his home and took readings of the thermal energy emanating from his home, and then going in to see if the person was growing marijuana. 

Exactly. And in that case, the reason for that case is that apparently—I’m not an expert in marijuana growing, but apparently, when you’re growing marijuana, there’s certain heating lights that you need. At least that’s what the case was describing. And it generates this enormous amount of heat that wouldn’t generally come from a home unless you were doing something like this. And what the Court did there—in an opinion by Justice Scalia, I believe it was—is it looked at the embedded questions of privacy in the home that underlied the unreasonable search and seizure, and the Court there, as I mentioned, determined that acts taken in the privacy of one’s home would commonly not be expected to be intruded upon unless the police secured a warrant. And to the extent that the law had generally recognized that if you worked actively to keep people out of your home—you locked your windows, you locked your doors, you didn’t let people walk by and peek through, you didn’t stand at your front door and show people what you were doing—that you were exhibiting your expectation of privacy. And to the extent that new technology had developed that you wouldn’t expect to intrude on that privacy, then you were protected by the Warrant Clause, and the police had an obligation to go talk to a magistrate and explain to them what their evidence was and let the magistrate—I use ‘‘the magistrate’’ in that more global sense. It would be a judge, but you would let a judge decide whether there was probable cause to issue the warrant—reasonable suspicion, probable cause—probable cause to issue the warrant. That’s how the courts addressed the unreasonable—or have addressed, the Supreme Court has, the unreasonable search and seizure, and balance the new technology with the expectations of privacy that are recognized in the Fourth Amendment. Yes, I thought a separate question which in my mind is different than the right to privacy with respect to personal information that could be otherwise available to the public as a byproduct of a criminal action or as a byproduct of your participation in some regulated activity of the Government. There are situations in which, if your industry is regulated, you are going to make disclosures to the Government, and then the question becomes how much and what circumstances can then Government make copies, put it in an electronic data base or use it in another situation. So much of that gets controlled by the issues you are saying Congress is thinking about, which is, What are people’s rights of privacy in their personal information? Should we as Congress as a matter of policy regulate that use?The Court itself had been commanded by Congress to look at certain privacy information of individuals and guard it from public disclosure in the data bases you are talking about. So we have been told, ‘‘Don’t go using somebody’s Social Security number and putting it in a data base.’’ That is part of a public document, but we have been told, ‘‘Don’t do that.’’ And there is a reason for that: because there is not only the issues of identity theft but other harms that come to people from that situation.So that broader question, as we many, is not one that one could talk about a philosophy about. As a judge, you have to look at the situation at issue, think about what Congress has said about that in the laws, and then consider what the Constitution may or may not say on that question, depending on the nature of the claim before the Court.

Thank you. 

Thank you, sir. 

Senator, don’t give her the chance. 

We should introduce our mothers. Okay? 

Yes, Senator. I take every case case-by-case and my mind is always open and I make no prejudgments as to conclusions. 

Yes. 

No. 

By the time a criminal defendant ends up in court, they’ve been shaped by their lives. If you want to give people the best opportunity of success at life, it’s a message I deliver fre-quently to my community, it has to be through early childhood forward.If you’re waiting to do that once they’re before a judge in court, your chances of success have diminished dramatically. And so one of my messages in many of my speeches to my community groups is pay attention to education.It’s the value mom taught me, but her lesson was not lost on me when I became a prosecutor and it’s a lesson that I continue to promote, because I so fervently believe it.The success of our communities depends on us improving the quality of our education of our children and parental participation in ensuring that that happens in our society.

That is. In the statement I made to the newspaper article, I was focusing on a different part of that, but it is. As a prosecutor, my role was not to look at what I thought the punishment should have been, because that was set in law.Sentences are set by Congress within statutory ranges, and my role was to prosecute on behalf of the people of the State of New York. And that role is different than one that I would do if I were a defense attorney, whose charge is to do something else to ensure that a defendant is given a fair trial and that the government has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.But we cannot remedy the ills of society in a courtroom. We can only apply the law to the facts before us.

I was influenced so greatly by a television show in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was Perry Mason. For the young people behind all of you, they may not even know who Perry Mason was.But Perry Mason was one of the first lawyers portrayed on television and his storyline is that in all of the cases he tried, except one, he proved his client innocent and got the actual murderer to confess.In one of the episodes, at the end of the episode, Perry Mason, with the character who played the prosecutor in the case, were meeting up after the case and Perry said to the prosecutor, ‘‘It must cause you some pain having expended all that effort in your case to have the charges dismissed.’’ And the prosecutor looked up and said, ‘‘No. My job as a prosecutor is do justice and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not.’’And I thought to myself that’s quite amazing to be able to serve that role; to be given a job, as I was, by Mr. Morgenthal, a job I’m eternally grateful to him for, in which I could do what justice required in an individual case.And it was not without bounds, because I served a role for society and that role was to ensure that the public safety and public interests were fully represented. But prosecutors, in each individual case, at least in my experience particularly under the tutelage of Mr. Morgenthal, was we did what the law required within the bounds of understanding that our job was not to play to the home crowd, not to look for public approval, but to look at each case, in some respects, like a judge does, individually.And that meant, in some cases, bringing the tough charge, and I was actually known in my office for doing that often, but that’s because I determined it was appropriate often. But periodically, I would look at the quality of evidence and say there’s just not enough.I had one case with an individual who was charged with committing a larceny from a woman and his defense attorney came to me and said, ‘‘I never ever do this, but this kid is innocent. Please look at his background. He’s a kid with a disability. Talk to his teachers. Look at his life. Look at his record. Here it is,’’ and he gave me the file.Everything he said was absolutely true. This was a kid with not a blemish in his life. And he said, ‘‘Please look at this case more closely.’’ And I went and talked to the victim and she—I had not spoken to her when the case was indicted. This was one of those cases that was transferred to me, and so it was my first time in talking to her, and I let her tell me the story and it turned out she had never seen who took her pocketbook.In that case, she saw a young man that the police had stopped in a subway station with a black jacket and she thought she had seen a black jacket and identified the young man as the one who had stolen her property.The young man, when he was stopped, didn’t run away. He was just sitting there. Her property wasn’t on him. And he had the background that he did. And I looked at that case and took it to my supervisor and said, ‘‘I don’t think we can prove this case.’’ And my supervisor agreed and we dismissed the charges.And then there are others that I prosecuted, very close cases, where I thought a jury should decide if someone was guilty and I prosecuted those cases and, more often than not, got conviction.My point is that that is such a wonderful part of being a prosecutor. That TV character said something that motivated my choices in life and something that holds true.And that’s not to say, by the way, and I firmly, firmly believe this, defense attorneys serve a noble role, as well. All participants in this process do, judges, juries, prosecutors and defense attorneys. We are all implementing the protections of the Constitution.

That case presented a very complicated question in second circuit law. There had been two cases addressing how much information a warrant has to contain and what kind in order for the police to search a defendant’s home or—I shouldn’tsay a home—a computer to see if the computer contained images of child pornography.The two cases—I should say the two panels—I wasn’t a member of either of those panels—had very extensive discussion about the implications of the cases because they involved the use of the Internet and how much information the police should or should not have before they looked to get a warrant to search someone’s computer, because the computer does provide people with freedom of speech, at least with respect to accessing information and reading it and thinking about it.In the case before me, I was looking at it in the backdrop of the conflict that it appeared to contain in our case law and what our case law said was important for a police officer to share with a judge and examined the facts before my case, looking at the information that the police had before them and considering whether, in light of existing second circuit law, as it addressed this issue, had the police actually violated the Constitution—I hope I can continue.

Whether they should get a warrant or not. And one member of the court said yes and they had violated the Constitution and I joined that part of the opinion because I determined, examining all of the facts of that case and the law, that that was the way the law—the result the law required. But then I looked at what the principles underlying the unreasonable search and seizures are without a warrant and looked at the question of what was the doctrine that underlay there, and what doctrine it underlays is that you don’t want the police violating your constitutional rights without a good faith basis, without probable case. And that’s why you have a judge make that determination. It’s why you require them to go to a judge. And so what I had to look at was whether we should make the police responsible for what would have been otherwise a judge’s error, not their error. They gave everything they had to the judge and they said to the judge, ‘‘I don’t know.’’ Even if they thought they knew, that isn’t what commands the warrant. It’s the judge’s review. So I was the judge in the middle. One judge joined one part of my opinion. The other judge joined the other part of the opinion. And so I held that the act violated the Constitution, but that the evidence could still be used because the officers had—there was, in law, a good faith exception to the error in the warrant. 

Well, in fact, it’s a holding the Supreme Court—an issue the Supreme Court addressed just this term.

And came out—or I came out the way the Supreme Court did on that. 

Yes. 

It’s always difficult to deal with people’s disappointments about cases, particularly when they have personal experiences and have their own sense of the impact of a case. I was a former prosecutor, it’s difficult proving cases as it is, calling more witnesses adds some burdens to the process. But at the end, that case is a decided case and so it’s holding now. It is holding and that’s what guides the court in the future on similar issues, to the extent there can be some. As I said, I do recognize that there can be problems, as a former prosecutor, but that also can’t compel a result. And all of those issues have to be looked at in the context of the court’s evaluation of the case and the judge’s view of what the law permits and doesn’t permit. 

The facts are the basis for the legal decision. A judge deals with a particular factual setting and applying the law to those facts. To the extent that there’s any criticism that I do that on the court of appeals, we’re not fact-finders, but we have to ensure that we understand the facts of the case to know what legal principle we’re applying it to.A judge’s job, whether it’s on the trial level, the circuit court or even the Supreme Court, is not to create hypothetical cases and answer the hypothetical case. It’s to answer the case that exists.And so in my view, and I’m not suggesting any justice does this or doesn’t do it, but I do think that my work as a state prosecutor and a trial judge sensitizes me to understanding and approaching cases starting from the facts and then applying the law to those facts as they exist.And, again, I don’t want to suggest that not all judges do that, but because I—because of my background, perhaps like Justice Souter, who also has the reputation of carefully looking at the facts and applying the law to the facts, it’s maybe that background that people are noticing and noticing where we picked up that habit.

It should be remembered that when I was a district court judge, the sentencing laws were different than they have become during my 12 years on the court of appeals. That— and it makes me sound ancient, but back in the days when I was a district court judge, the sentencing guidelines were focused on the amount of a fraud and didn’t consider the number of victims or the consequences on the number of victims of a crime.Perhaps because of my prosecutorial background, perhaps because I considered the perspective of prosecutors who came before me, that the guidelines—and their arguments—that the guidelines didn’t adequately consider the number of victims and that that should be a factor, because someone who commits 100,000 $1—not $1—$1,000 crimes may be as culpable as the person who does aone-time act of $100,000, and depending on the victims and the impact on the victims.Those are factors that one should consider. And so many of the white collar sentences that you are talking about were focused on looking at the guidelines and what the guideline were addressing and ensuring that I was considering, as the sentencing statutes require the court to do, at all of the circumstances of the crime.I suspect that may drive one of the reasons why I may have given higher white collar crime sentences than some of my colleagues; not to suggest they didn’t listen to the argument, but they may have had a different perspective on it.I should tell you that my circuit endorsed that factor as a consideration under the guidelines, somewhat after I had started imposing sentences on this view, but they also agreed that this was a factor that courts could consider in fashioning a sentence.Crime is crime and to the extent that you’re protecting the interests of society, you take your cues from the statute Congress gives and the sentencing range that Congress sets. And so to the extent that in all my cases I balanced the individual sentence with, as I was directed to, the interests that society sought to protect, then I applied that evenhandedly to all cases.So it’s important to remember the guidelines were mandatory. And so I took my charge as a district court judge seriously at the time to only deviate in the very unusual case, which was permitted by the guidelines.

As you know, there’s been a great number of cases in the Supreme Court, the Booker/Fanfan line of case. The Booker/Fanfan case determined they were guidelines.My own personal experience as an appellate judge is that because the Supreme Court has told the district courts to give serious consideration to the guidelines, there’s been a little bit—not a little bit—there’s been discretion given to district courts, but they are basically still staying within the guidelines and I think that’s because the guidelines prove useful as a starting point to consider what an appropriate sentence may be.

I haven’t seen television for a very long time. But I will admit that I turned it on for a little while last night.

That’s what teamwork helps you with. 

I should beg you all not to hold that against me.

Good afternoon, Senator. It is good talking to you again. 

Well, actually it is a continuation of what I explained to Senator Klobuchar. I had in the DA’s office realized that in the criminal law system, we could not affect changes of opportunity for people. We were dealing with a discreet issue and applying the law to the situation at hand. But if there was going to be an increase of opportunity for all people, that that had to involve an increase in economic opportunity and in economic development for different communities. So that in combination with my desire to broaden my own personal understanding of as many aspects of law as I could, I decided that I should change my focus and concentrate on commercial matters rather than criminal matters. It also guided much of the pro bono work I did thereafter which also involved questions of finances and economic opportunities. And so I served on the New York State Mortgage Board and the New York State Mortgage Office was involved in giving individuals affordable housing or loans for affordable housing. I was a board member of the New York City Campaign Finance Board. Those were activities that motivated in large measure because of my growing belief that economic opportunities for people were the way to address many of the growth needs of communities.

It was a wonderful practice because unlike some of my law school friends, I very much wanted to go into a small law firm where I could have hands on practice. Having been a prosecutor and having made all of the decisions, individual decisions I made, I thought to myself as I was leaving the DA’s office, I do not think I can go to those firms where I would be the fifth guy on the totem pole, that I wanted to have more hands on experience. So I went to a smaller firm where I actually until I became a partner tended to work directly with the partner and would often counsel businesses. I did a wide variety of commercial issues.I was involved in grain commodity trading, people buying home grown grains of all kinds, you can name them all, including orange peels as feed for animals, and the contracts that they were involved in in doing those trades.Our firm represented a very impressive list of client, including Ferrari the car manufacturer. I did a great deal of their work as it related to their dealer relationships and to their customer relationships. So I involved myself in those commercial transactions which were different focus, different emphasis.I also represented—not me, but the firm, but I counseled the client on many of its dealer relations issue of Pirelli Tire Corporation. These are names I suspect many people know.

And from the fashion designer, and I think there are many people who know how famous that fashion house design is, had trademark questions. I participated with the partner who founded that practice within the law firm and she had a very untimely death. Actually she came from her home ill to vote on my partnership at the firm and I became a partner and a couple of months later, she passed away. But she had worked with me and introduced me to the intellectual property area of law. I worked on real estate matters, I worked on contract matters of all kinds, licensing agreements, financing agreements, banking questions. There was such a wide berth of issues that I dealt with. 

Actually, one of the lessons I learned from my commercial practice, I learned in the context first of my grain commodity trading, but in the work as it related to all commercial disputes, one main lesson. In business, the predictability of law may be the most necessary in the sense that people organize their business relationships by how they understand the court’s interpret their contracts. I remember being involved in any number of litigations where at the end of the litigation as part of a settlement, I would draft up a settlement agreement between the parties. Quite often it involved creating an ongoing new business relationship or a temporary continuation of a business relationship until they could wind down. I would draft up the agreement like a litigator, like the judge I try to be. Say it in simple works. I would give it to my corporatepartners, and I should not say it this way. I would get back stuff that sometimes I would look at and say, what does this gobbly goop mean? They would laugh at me and say, it has meaning. This is how the courts have interpreted it. It is very important to the relationship of the parties that they know what the expectations are in law about their relationship.Then I understood why it was important to phrase things in certain ways. It made me very respectful about the importance of predictability in terms of court interpretation of business terms because that was very, very critical to organizing business relationships in our country.

It is interesting because I remember one case, and I cannot give you details because I would be breaching confidentiality.But I remember a client coming in to me with a fairly substantial litigation and I looked at the client and I said, ‘‘I evaluated the case.’’ I said, ‘‘There are some novel theories here. I really think you can win, but there is a serious question about the cost to get there because these are all the things that we would have to do to get there and it is going to cost you,’’ it was millions of dollars that I estimated.The client went to another lawyer who gave them a different evaluation. They went with that other lawyer. My firm lost all that income. But the client came back afterwards. The figure I put on the litigation was exactly what they spent and more.Settlements are generally in the business world economic decisions, balancing both the cost of litigation and the right of the issue. But business has a different function than courts. Business function is to do business, to do their work, to sell products,—relationships and litigation are different.As a judge when I was a District Court judge, most of my focus was on doing what I used to do as a lawyer, to talk to parties not about the merits of their case, but about the consideration of thinking about creative and new ways to approach a legal dispute so they could avoid the cost of litigation.As a Circuit Court judge, I am very cognizant of the cost of litigation and look at what parties are doing in the courts below, bearing that in mind.

Well, no question that it made me more sensitive to the importance of facts and looking at the facts the court has found and the facts that the parties are arguing and looking at the record to understand what went on.I often point to this example. When I sit on panels, and our court is blessed by having judges with a wide variety of circumstances. I know for me because I was a trial judge, I would read all the briefs in a case, I would read the District Court decision.If parties were arguing something and the District Court didn’t address it, my first question to my law clerks were, go back to the record and tell me why not. Most judges address arguments that people are raising and I would get to oral argument and if I was the only judge with a trial experience, I would look at the parties and say, did you argue this before the District Court?I could see some of the antennas going up for those colleagues who hadn’t had that experience. They said, I never even thought of that. Look in fact if that was the case.There are all sorts of doctrines that do not permit parties to argue new things on appeal. And so that is how the experience comes in, both the sensitivity to facts and the sensitivity to ensure that you’re applying law to those facts.

You have just raised the very first question that will come up when Congress passes an Act.I can assure you, knowing every time that Congress passes an Act, there is a challenge by somebody. As soon as it is applied to someone in a way that they do not like, they are going to come into court. So I cannot answer that question.

Well, I cannot answer that question because it invites an answer to the potential challenge.What I can say to you is that Congress has certain constitutional powers. One of them is to pass laws affecting interstate commerce. So the question will be the nature of whatever statute Congress passes, what facts it relies upon and the remedy that it institutes.So the question would depend on the nature of the statute and what it is doing.

Well, it has the ability to—the constitutional terms are to make laws that involve commerce between the states. Those are the words and generally that has been interpreted to mean pass laws that affect commercial interstate transaction.

I am trying to think if there is any situation in which a judge would have occasion to judge in that way. Policymaking, making of laws is up to Congress. A judge’s personal views as to whether that policy choice is good or bad has no role in evaluating Congress’ choice.The question for us is always a different one, which is what has Congress done? Is it constitutional in the manner in which it has done it. But policy choices are Congress’ choices. In all areas, deference has to be given to that choice.

Deference has been given in that area by the courts as well. Generally one looks at what Congress has said about that question because executive agencies have to apply and talk about regulations in light of what Congress has commanded. But those are also entitled to deference in different factual situations.

Everything. We are the home of New York City. Our jurisdiction is, and I am sure that another state is going to complain, but we are the business capital of the world. That is how it has been described by others.So we deal with every variant of securities law as one could imagine, from investment questions to misleading statements to investors to whatever Congress has regulated, our circuit will have a case on it. Or I should say it usually starts with the District Courts and it will perk up to the Circuit Court. But if you have a securities law, we will likely eventually hear the argument.

I presume so because it has been a part of my work both as a District Court and a Circuit Court judge.

It is somewhat important to recognize the limited role that courts serve and the issue of remedy also is one where one has to talk about remedy against whom and for what.In the ways that these individuals were injured, they were injured by third parties who had done allegedly illegal acts against them. The court’s ruling did not affect their ability to take actionagainst those individuals and clearly that is always difficult in some situations when the individual has been arrested, et cetera. But they are still remedies that law provides in terms of whatever assets those individuals have, whatever criminal actions the government may take, often funds are created to reimburse victims.The question here was whether an agency that in case law was seen to have a quasi governmental function, whether you could sue that agency for conduct that—for not regulating the other individuals adequately in helping to prevent the activity.But regulation comes in different forms by the quasi governmental agencies and what they can do depends on the exercise of discretion under the laws as they exist at the time.So the immunity doctrine wasn’t looking at the issue of how to recompense the individuals, it was looking at the quasi functions of government. So there is a different perspective that was given to the judges in that case.

Well, there is a doctrine of Chevron deference and it goes to the issue of who makes the decisions and that goes to policy questions.To the extent that an agency interpretation is not inconsistent with congressional commands, express commercial commands, a judge cannot substitute their own judgment of what policies should be or regulations should be, but is commended to give deference.There are obviously in every situation a set of exceptions to when you do not, but you have to then apply a consideration of each of those exceptions in the particular circumstance before you.There have been other situations in which I have ruled and said no, the agency is not interpreting the statute in accordance with what the panel viewed was Congress’ intent. Yesterday I believe one of the other Senators asked me about the Riverkeeper case.

The Supreme Court came to a different view of what the words Congress used meant. But the point is that the role of course is not to substitute their own judgments. It is to apply the principles of law in accordance with the acts that agencies are doing. 

It is a right Congress has given presumably because Congress has made a policy choice that it is a way to ensure that individual’s injuries are remedied. That is a part of many of our securities laws and our anti-trust laws. Government doesn’t have unlimited resources to pursue all individual injuries. And so in some situations, Congress makes achoice to grant a private cause of action and in some it doesn’t. That is a legislative choice.

As a—— 

I am trying to think—I do not remember having direct experience in anti-trust law when I was in private practice. I do not think I did. So I had very little. I am trying to think of any of my cases on the District Court and major league baseball strike was one of them. It is the one that I can think of. I had anti-trust cases there as well. Often the cases settled actually, and so managing those cases was the prime function I had as a District Court judge. If you will give me a chance to look at my District Court decisions again to see if—and what other cases in the anti-trust area I may have ruled upon in District Court, I can get back to you, Senator, either at the next round or in a written question. I just do not—— On the Circuit Court it is different. I have participated directly in writing opinions and joining panels on opinions. So I’ve had at least two if not three or four or five of those cases. 

Well, you do not use economic theory to determine the constitutionality of congressional action. That is a different question I think than the one that Leegin addressed. What Leegin addressed was how the court would apply congressional act, the anti-trust laws to a factual question before it. That’s a different issue because that doesn’t do with questioning the economic choices of Congress. That goes to whether or not in reviewing the action of a particular defendant what view the court is going to apply to that activity. In the Leegin case, the court’s decision was look, we have prior case law that says that this type of activity is always anti-competitive. The court in reconsidering that issue in the Leegin case said well, there has been enough presented in the courts below to show that maybe it is not in some activity as anti-competitive. So we are not going to subject it to an absolute bar, we are going to subject it to a review under rule of reason. That is why I said it is not a question of questioning Congress’ economic choices or the economic theories that underlay its decisions in a legislation. They weren’t striking down the anti-trust laws. What the court was trying to do was figure out how it would apply that law to a particular set of facts before it.

I think that that—as you may know, the doctrine of Stare Decisis is not dependent on one factor. 

The court considers a variety of different factors, including the administrative workability of a law, the reliance factor that society has put into that rule, that precedent, the cost to change it, whether the underlying doctrines in related areas, the underlying framework of related areas would lead a court to question whether the prior precedent really has a framework that’s consistent with an understanding in this area that has been developed in other cases. And finally, has there been a change in society that shows that the factual findings upon which the older case was premised may be wrong. There is always the question as part of that analysis and other factors the courts may think about as to whether the older rule has been affirmed by the court and how often, over what period of time. To the extent that Justice White is talking about a factor that the court should put into that mix, the court has recognized in its Stare Decisis jurisprudence that all of the factors weigh into the decision. You think about why and under what circumstances you should alter the course of the court’s interpretation as set forth in prior precedent. 

Well, the purposes of the anti-trust theory is premised on ensuring competition in the marketplace. The question, like the one you pose, is one that would come to the court in a particular context and a challenge to some approach the court has used in this area. I obviously cannot say absolutely yes in a hypothetical, but obviously the court is always looking at what activity is claimed to be illegal under the anti-trust laws and what effect is has on anti-competitive behavior. The question frequently in anti-trust is is a particular area subject to per se barring or is it subject to the rule of reason, and the two have different approaches to the question. 

She needed a short break, but it wasn’t because of Senators Specter or Franken. 

I know, Senator Specter, that there is questions by many people, including Senators and yourself, of Justice Roberts and other nominees about this issue. Can the Court take on more? To the extent that there is concern about it, not that public opinion should drive the Justices to take more cases just to take them, but I think what Justice Roberts was saying is the Court needs to think about its processes to ensure that it’s fulfilling its——

Well, perhaps I need to explain to you that I don’t like making statements about what I think the Court can do until I’ve experienced the process. 

I know it must be very frustrating to you to—— 

No. I am sure—— 

I can understand not only Congress’ or your personal frustration, and sometimes of citizens, when there are important issues that they would like the Court to consider. The question becomes what do I do if you give me the honor to serve on the Court. If I say something today, is that going to make a statement about how I am going to prejudge someone else’s—— 

There are often, from what I understand— and that’s from my review of Supreme Court actions and cases of situations in which they have or have not taken cases, and I’ve read some of their reasoning as to this. I know that with some important issues they want to make sure that there isn’t a procedural bar to the case of some type that would take away from whether they’re, in fact, doing what they would want to do, which is to——

Senator, I’m sorry. I did mull this over. My problem is that without looking at a particular issue and considering the cert. brief style, the discussion of potential colleagues as to the reasons why a particular issue should or should not be considered, the question about——

I don’t use the word ‘‘super.’’ I don’t know how to take that word. All precedent of the Court is entitled to the respect of the doctrine of stare decisis.

That is one of the factors that I believe courts have used to consider the issue of whether or not a new direction should be taken in the law. There is a variety of different factors the Court uses, not just one.

The history of a particular holding of the Court and how the Court has dealt with it in subsequent cases would be among one of the factors as many that a Court would likely consider. Each situation, however, is considered in a variety of different viewpoints and arguments but, most importantly, factors that the Court applies to this question of should precedent be altered in a way.

In Casey itself—— 

Casey itself applied—or an opinion authored by Justice Souter talked about the factors that a Court thinks about in whether to change precedent, and among them were issues of whether or not or how much reliance society has placed in the prior precedent; what are the costs that would be occasioned by changing it; was the rule workable or not; have either factualor doctrinal basis of the prior precedent altered, either from developments in related areas of law or not, to counsel a re-examination of a question, and——

And the Court has considered in other cases the number of times the issue has arisen and what actions the Court has or not taken with respect to that. Roe is—Casey did reaffirm the core holding of Roe, and so my understanding would be that the issue would be addressed in light of Casey on the stare decisis—— 

Senator, the question of whether I agree with a view of a particular Justice or not is not something that I can say in terms of the next case. In the next case that the Court will look at and a challenge to a particular congressional statute—— 

As I understand the congruence and proportionality test, it is the Supreme Court’s holding on that test, as Iunderstand it, that there is an obligation on the Court to ensure that Congress is working—working—is legislating within its legislative powers.The issue is not—and these are Section 5 cases, essentially, which are the clause of the Constitution under the 14th Amendment that permits Congress to legislate issues involving violations of the 14th amendment. The Court in those cases has not said that Congress can’t legislate. What it has looked at is the form of remedy Congress can order and what it——

I would find it difficult to agree with someone else’s words. I can tell you how much I understand the deference that Congress is owed, and I can point you at least to two cases— and there are many, many more—that shows how much I value the fact that we are courts that must give deference to Congress in the fields that are within its constitutional power.

I agree to the extent that one’s talking about the deference that Congress is owed. I can’t speak for what he intended to say by that. I can speak to what I——

I heard what he said, sir, but I don’t know what he intended in that description. I do know what I can say, which is that I do understand the importance to Congress’ factual findings, that my cases and my approach in my cases reflect that. I’ve had any number of cases where the question was deference to congressional findings, and I have upheld statutes because of that deference.

That, in fact, is one of the beauties of our constitutional system, which is we do have a separation of——

Well, the only advantage you have in my case is that I have a 17-year record that I think demonstrates how I approach the law and the deference with which—or the deference I give to the other branches of Government. 

As you know, when there have been options for me to participate in cameras in the courtroom, I have. And as I said to you when we met, Senator, I will certainly relay those positive experiences, if I become fortunate enough to be there to discuss it with my colleagues. And that question is an important one, obviously. There is legislation being considered both by—or has been considered by Congress at various times, and there is much discussion between the branches on that issue.It is an ongoing dialog. It is important to remember that the Court because of this issue has over time made public the transcripts of its hearing quicker and quicker, if I am accurate, now. It used to take a long time for them to make those transcripts available, and now they do it before the end of the day.It is an ongoing process of discussion. 

I am. 

Many describe the telephone as a revolutionary invention, that changed our country dramatically. So did television. And its regulation of television and the rules that would apply to it were considered by Congress, and those regulations have—because Congress is the policy chooser on how items related to interstate commerce and communications operate. And that issue was reviewed by the courts in the context of the policy choices Congress made.There is no question in my mind as a citizen that the Internet has revolutionized communications in the United States, and there is no question that access to that is a question that society—that our citizens as well as yourself are concerned about.But the role of the court is never to make the policy. It is to wait until Congress acts and then determine what Congress has done and its constitutionality in light of that ruling.Brand X, as I understood it, was a question of which Government agency would regulate those providers, and the Court, looking at Congress’ legislation in these two areas, determined that it thought it fit in one box, not the other, one agency instead of another.

Exactly, but the question was not so much stronger regulation or not stronger regulation. It was which set of regulations, given Congress’ choice, controlled.Obviously, Congress may think that the regulations the Court has in its holding interpreted Congress’ intent and that Congress thinks the Court got it wrong. We are talking about statutory interpretation and Congress’ ability to alter the Court’s understanding by amending the statute if it chooses.This is not to say that I minimize the concerns you express. Access to Internet, given its importance in everything today—most businesses depend on it. Most individuals find their information. The children in my life virtually live on it now. And so its importance implicates a lot of different questions—freedom of speech, freedom with respect to property rights, Government regulation. There’s just so many issues that get implicated by the Internet that what the Court can do is not choose the policy. It just has to go by interpreting each statute and trying to figure out what Congress intends.

Rights by a court are not looked at as overriding in the sense that I think a citizen—or a citizen would think about it, should this go first or should a competing right go second. Rights are rights, and what the Court looks at is how Congress balanced those rights in a particular situation and then judges whether that balance is within constitutional boundaries.Calling one more compelling than the other suggests that they’re sort of—you know, property interests are less important than First Amendment interests. That’s not the comparison a court makes. The comparison the court makes starts with what balance does Congress choose first, and that we’ll look at that if it—and see if it’s constitutional.

It’s not a term I use. I don’t use the term because I don’t describe the work that judges do in that way. I assume the good faith of judges in their approach to the law, which is that each one of us is attempting to interpret the law according to principles of statutory construction and other guiding legal principles, and to come in good faith to an outcome that we believe is directed by law. When I say ‘‘we believe,’’ hopefully we all go through the process of reasoning it out and coming to a conclusion in accordance with the principles of law. I think you are right that one of the problems with this process is that people think of activism as the wrong conclusion in light of policy. But hopefully judges—and I know that I don’t approach judging in this way at all—are not imposing policy choices or their views of the world or their views of how things should be done. That would be judicial activism in my sense if a judge was doing something improper like that. But I don’t use that word because that’s something different than what I consider to be the process of judging, which is each judge coming to each situation trying to figure out what the law means, applying it to the particular fact before that judge. 

As you know, some of the Justices in that recent decision expressed the view that the Court should take up the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act and review its continuing necessity. Justice Thomas expressed his view. That very question, given the decision and the fact that it left that issue open, is a very clear indication that that’s a question that the courts are going to be addressing, if not immediately the Supreme Court, certainly the lower courts. And so expressing a view, agreeing with one person in that decision or another, would suggest that I have made a prejudgment on this question. I consider——

All I can say to you is—I have one decision among many, but one decision on the Voting Rights Act, and not the recent reauthorization by Congress, but a prior amendment where I suggested that these issues needed—issues of changes inthe Voting Rights Act should be left to Congress in the first instance.My jurisprudence shows the degree to which I give deference to Congress’ findings. Whether in a particular situation that compels or doesn’t or leads to a particular result is not something that I can opine on, because particularly the issue you are addressing right now is likely to be considered by the courts. The ABA rule says no judge should make comments on the merits of any pending or impending case, and this clearly would be an impending case.

I gave deference to the exact language that Congress had used in the Voting Rights Act and how it applied to a challenge in that case.

I am. 

I don’t think I have, because to the extent that the parties have not raised an issue and the circuit court for some reason the panel has thought that it was pertinent—most often that happens on questions of jurisdiction. Can the Court hear this case at all? Then you issue—or we have issued a direction to the parties to brief that question, so it is briefed and part of the argument that is raised.There are issues that the parties brief that the briefing itself raises the issue for the Court to consider. So it is generally the practice, at least on the Second Circuit, to give a party an opportunity to be heard on a question. And we also have a procedure on the circuit that would give a party to be heard because they can also file the petition for rehearing, which is the panel enters a decision that the party disagrees with and thinks the court has not given it an adequate opportunity to present its arguments. Then it can file that at the circuit.I don’t have—I am familiar with the Northwest case. I am familiar with the holding of that case. I am a little less familiar and didn’t pay as much attention——

I don’t like characterizing the reasons for why Congress acts or doesn’t act. 

No, sir. 

Yes. [Laughter.] 

The word ‘‘privacy’’ is not.

It contains, as has been recognized by the courts for over 90 years, certain rights under the liberty provision of the Due Process Clause, that extend to the right to privacy in certain situations. This line of cases started with a recognition that parents have a right to direct the education of their children and that the State could not force parents to send their children to public schools or to bar their children from being educated in ways a State found objectionable. Obviously, States do regulate the content of education, at least in terms of requiring certain things with respect to education that I don’t think the Supreme Court has considered. But that basic right to privacy has been recognized and was recognized. And there have been other decisions.

Certainly there are some very specific words in the Constitution that have to be given direct application. There are some direct commands by the Constitution. You know, Senators have to be a certain age to be Senators, and so you got to do what those words say. But the Constitution is written in broad terms, and what a court does is then look at how those terms apply to a particular factual setting before it.

The Court has said in many cases—and as I think has been repeated in the Court’s jurisprudence in Casey— that there is a right to privacy that women have with respect to the termination of their pregnancies in certain situations.

I wish I remember the name of the episode, but I don’t. I just was always struck that there was only one case where his client was actually guilty and—— 

I know that I should remember the name of it, but I haven’t looked at the episode—— 

You’re right, but I was spending a lot of time on reviewing cases. But I do have that stark memory because, like you, I watched it all of the time, every week as well. I just couldn’t interest my mother the nurse and my brother the doctor to do it with me. 

Thank you. 

Senator, I think that it’s one of the reasons that every President in the last two—or say 20 years, 25 years, has attempted to promote diversity on a basic understanding that our society is enriched by its confidence that our legal system is—includes all members of society. I know that Justice Ginsburg has spoken about the fact of how much she misses Justice O’Connor, and not because she does not have a good relationship with her colleagues.I understand that she and Justice Scalia have a very, very close friendship and attend the opera together and travel together, so it’s not a question, I don’t think, of whether there’s any question about the importance of the confidence that Americans have in our system because they see that everyone’s represented as a part of our legal system, both as judges, as lawyers, as participants on every level of our work.

That is a part of the holding of Gideon. It has been reaffirmed in terms of the right to counsel, not only the right to counsel and the representation of criminal issues, but the court has recognized that right with respect to a competent counsel, the question of whether incompetent counsel has caused the defendant damage as assessed under a legal standard. But the question is, the right to counsel was the core holding of Gideon.

Their rights are meaningful and they are rights that we work at ensuring are given meaning in the courts. I know for a fact that one of the activities—I know for a fact. I know, because I lived it. When I became a judge on the Second Circuit I was given responsibility for the Second Circuit’s Committee on the Criminal Judge Act and Pro Bono Service. Generally, that— the chair of the committee is the most recent addition to the court, and immediately upon the confirmation of another judge, that judge takes over the chairpersonship.I, because of my belief in the meaningfulness of representation and its importance to the justice system, have held that position probably for the longest judge in the Second Circuit. With the agreement of judges who came after me, I served as the chair of that committee. I don’t know—remember exactly the number of years, but it was certainly a very long period of time, and I worked very hard to improve both the processes of selection of Criminal Justice Act attorneys—those are the attorneys that represent indigent defendants in criminal actions—and to ensure that there was adequate review of their qualifications and regular review of their performance.

Clearly, that’s—in terms of the—it’s given meaning through actions, and actions by the legislature, who have provided funds for the retention of qualified counsel, and the court’s obligation to ensure that that right is meaningful in practice.

Senator, I want to give you complete assurance that I agree with Senator Hatch on his decision—his definition of activism. If that’s his definition, that judges should not be using their personal biases, their personal experiences, their personal prejudices in reaching decision and that’s how he defines activism, then I’m in full agreement with him. To the extent that my words have led some to believe that I think a particular group has—has—is better than another in reaching a decision based on their experiences, my rhetorical device failed. It failed because it left an impression that I believe some-thing that I don’t. And as I have indicated, it was a bad choice of words by me in—because it left an impression that has offended people and has left an impression that I didn’t intend. As I indicated earlier, I——

As I—I can explain it, is I didn’t understand her to mean that she thought that if two judges reached a different conclusion, that one of them was unwise because judges disagree as to conclusions. And I know that there’s an aspiration that the law would be so certain that that would never happen, but it’s not that certain. Laws are not written clearly, on occasion, by Congress. Courts apply principles of construction that suggest an approach to a particular set of facts that might differ. All of that doesn’t make one or the other judge wise. So——

It may well come up. And I’m not familiar enough with the regulations in all 50 States to know whether there’s an absolute prohibition in any one city or State against the possession of firearms. All I can speak about is that, as in the case the panel looked at, the question for the court would not be whether the government action in isolation is constitutional or not. The question—in isolation. It would be, what’s the nature of the government interest in the statute it’s passing? And depending on the——

Exactly. And so—— 

Because that question of incorporation before the court will arise, I don’t feel that I can comment on the merits of the hypothetical. All I can say is, regardless of what standard of review the court uses, it has struck down regulations under every standard of review used, whether it’s rational basis, or insome instances strict scrutiny, et cetera. There is the constitutional——

I have not prejudged the question that the Supreme Court left open in Heller, and the question the court left open itself was, should it reexamine the issue of whether this right should be incorporated against the States or not? It didn’t, in large measure, because the issue before the court at that moment was the right with respect to Federal Government regulation.I have not made up my mind. I didn’t say that I believed it wasn’t fundamental or that I hold a view that it’s not. I don’t hold a view about whether it should be incorporated or not. The issue before me and the panel in Maloney was whether the Supreme Court had said that and what Second Circuit had said about that issue.

There is one Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, in a decision written by Judge Easterbrook, who came to the same conclusion.

He may not have because—— 

Senator, may I—— 

Well—— 

Well, when the court looks at that issue it will decide, is it incorporated or not, and it will determine, by applying the test that it has subsequent to its old precedent, whether or not it is fundamental, and hence, incorporated. But the Maloney decision was not addressing the merits of that question, it was addressing what precedent said on that issue. 

No, sir. Because these conversations were in the context—and discussions were in the context of my pointing out, just as she had, that foreign law can’t be a holding, it can’t be precedent, it can’t be used in that way. She is talking about the way I was to—and what I said in my speech at the beginning and the end, ideas. What are you thinking about? Judges use Law Review articles, they use statements by other courts. The New York Court of Appeals, in a recent case, looked to foreign law to address an issue that it was considering, not in terms of a holding for the court, but a way of thinking about it that it would consider.My point is that I wasn’t advocating that it should ever serve as precedent or ever serve as a holding. I was talking about the dialog of ideas and——

When I was responding to the Senator I was talking about the board in general. I belonged to many committees, and so I did other things besides fund raising. But I was beginning to explain what the structure of the board was and what the primary responsibility of board members is. But clearly, board members serve other functions in an organization.

No, because, as I said, I was—I started to describe the role of the board generally and we were not addressing the question of what I did or how I participated. That memo has to be examined in context. The memo was a moment in our 12-year history where the board was planning a retreat to think about what directions, if any, we should consider moving into or not. We were not reviewing the individual cases to see if the individual cases—what positions were taken, the type of strategies that we——

The end of my answer was, the Fund had been involved in a series of areas, employment, public health, education, and others. And so the broader question for the Fund was, should we be considering some other areas of interest to the community? We held a retreat in which speakers from a variety of different civil rights organizations, academics, a number of people came and just talked to us. I don’t actually remember there being a firm decision that followed that, but it was a part of a conversation, the sort of retreats that even my court has engaged in: what are we doing; what are we thinking about? But it wasn’t a review of each individual case to judge its merits. 

Justice Scalia, in a footnote in the Heller decision, noted the court’s holding that the Second Amendment wasn’t incorporated against the States. 

The doctrine of stare decisis is a doctrine that looks to the value in the stability, consistency, predictability of precedent and it starts from the principles that precedent are important values to the society because it helps those goals. It also guides judges in recognizing that those who have become before them, the judges who have looked at these issues, have applied careful thought to the question and view things in a certain way, and a court should—a judge should exercise some humility and caution in disregarding the thoughts and conclusions of others who came—who came in that position before them.But that’s not to suggest that the doctrine says that precedence is immutable. And, in fact, I believe that England had an experiment with that question and—and it was not horribly successful. Precedents are precedents. They’re not immutable, they have to change in certain circumstances. And those circumstances generally have been described by Justice Souter in the Casey case, are probably the best articulation people have come to in sort of talking about the factors that courts think about.And it starts with, well, how much reliance has the society put into the precedent? What are the costs of changing it? I shouldn’t say ‘‘start’’. He put them in a different order. There’s no real importance to the order because all are factors that you put into the weighing as a judge looks at an existing precedent. It looks to whether the—whatever the court has said. Is it providing enough guidance to the court’s below and to—and for people to determine what they can or can’t do? Is the precedent administratively workable?Number three—and as I said, there’s no ordering to this—are the facts that the court assumed in its older precedents. Have those changed so that it would raise a question about the court revisiting a precedent? Also, has—are the—there are developments in related fields to precedents and approaches that are developed in those cases that may bring into question the foundation of an older precedent.Brown v. Board of Education has often been described as a radical change by some, and the public perceives it as a radical change. When you actually look at its history, you realize there had been jurisprudence for over 20 years by the court striking down certain—certain schemes that provided ‘‘separate but equal’’, but in fact didn’t achieve their stated goal.And so there was underpinnings in Brown v. Board of Education that, in those precedents that came before Brown that obviously gave the court some cause, some reason to re-think this issue of ‘‘separate but equal’’. They also had before them the—probably one of the most famous dissents in American history, which was the dissent by Justice Harlan in Plessy.And Justice Harlan so carefully laid out what the Constitution said, what the principles of the Constitution were that motivated the—the Congress to pass those amendments. He laid out the court’s precedents in that area and he said, separate but equal is just not consistent with the Constitution.Now, this isn’t an opinion where he described another group of people as different, and so it wasn’t that he was being motivatedby his personal views. He was being motivated by a view of the law that the court, in Brown, made a change about.One final factor the court obviously looks at is the number of times a precedent has been reaffirmed by the court, but all of these things are decided on the basis of judgment of a particular case and the arguments that are raised before a judge, and recognizing as a judge that precedent is deserving of deference, precedent, and changing it should be done cautiously by a court, but precedent can’t stand if other things counsel that it not.

As with all issues of statutory construction, my charge as a judge would be, how do I apply a court’s holding in a particular case in the next situation before me? The concern that you express is one that I have heard about that expressed by some, but as a judge I don’t make policy. I don’t make the policy choices for Congress. I’m charged with looking at a particular situation that comes before me, looking at the court’s precedent and applying it to that situation. With respect to that case, I—I—that case, as I understand the case, had to do with how much had to be pled. I didn’t understand it to mean that there had to be the presentation of evidence at the pleading stage, just what had to be pled to withstand a motion to dismiss in the case. 

As I said, the issue of concern is not how I look at the court’s precedents, because what I’m doing in looking at the court’s precedent is thinking about how it applies to another case. The question of how to do that and whether that’s right by the court would be a question that Congress, who has passed the antitrust laws, would have to, in the first instance, think about changing. 

The court considers its various precedents in the context of a new situation. In the cases decided by the courts, they’re applied to the facts of the particular case. Twombly is con-sidered, as are all the court’s precedent in a new case, that examines the issue of what a complaint must allege or not allege.

No. It’s precedent. 

It must be applied, as is all the court’s existing precedents that have not been rejected by the court. It has to be considered and has to be weighed in the situation presented. 

And Senator, the one thing I do know as a judge is that every argument gets made to the courts not on one occasion, but many. The question that will arise is: what’s the extent of the court’s application in the next case? 

What I know, and you did accurately describe one aspect of the Supreme Court’s local rules that suggest just that Justices will consider a variety of factors in whether to grant cert or not, and one of those listed factors is disagreement among the Circuits, disagreements among the Circuits and Circuits and State courts and issues that have not been adequately addressed but require being addressed for a variety of different reasons. It is very difficult to talk in the abstract about when cert should be granted because each situation presents a different set of facts and each question about whether a case is in the right posture tolook at an issue—as I said yesterday, sometimes there—yesterday I said—I may have explained earlier in a response to Senator Specter, and I know that you had stepped away, there are procedural— there are cases that present other arguments than the one that the Circuit split exists on, and those other arguments might dispose of the case in the way the Circuit Court did and not necessitate the reaching of an issue.There’s a question, at least as some Justices have defined it, of whether there’s been enough percolation among the Circuit Courts so that all of the views of a particular issue have been fully explored. The circumstances and the issues that each Justice uses depends on the facts and the posture of what comes before it. I would obviously consider the court’s local rules. I would give consideration to the point that some have raised, that the court is not doing enough.But that can’t counsel taking cases. That could only be—look at my—look at the workload and see, can the case—can the court do this if it meets all the other criteria that goes into the mixture of whether to grant cert or not? You don’t, like Congress, think about policy, we’re going to decide 150 cases this year. You look at the cases that come before you and you figure out which ones are in a place to be reviewed.

Senator, I would find it inappropriate to make suggestions to Congress about what standards it should hold judges to or litigants to. That’s a policy choice that Congress will consider.I note that the American Bar Association has a Code of Conduct that applies to litigants. The Judicial Code has a Code of Conduct for judges. And as you noted in—in the State system where judges are elected, many States are doing what I just spoke about, making and passing regulations.Caperton was a case that was taken under the local rules of the Supreme Court, presumably, that exercises supervisory powers over the functioning of the courts and it presented, obviously, a significant issue because the court took it and decided the case.At issue fundamentally is that judges, lawyers, all professionals must, on their own, abide by the highest standards of conduct. And I have given a speech on this topic to students at Yale at one point where I said the law is only the minimum one must do. Personally, one must act in a way in cases to ensure that you’re acting consistent with your sense of meeting the highest standards of the profession.

Senator, I have attempted to answer every question that’s been posed to me. You have noted that Citizens United is on the court’s docket for September. I think it’s September 9th. If I were confirmed for the—to the court, it would be the first case that I would participate in.Given that existence of that case, the very first one, I think it would be inappropriate for me to do anything to speak about that area of the law because it would suggest that I’m going into that process with some prejudgment about what precedent says and what it doesn’t say, and how to apply it in the open question the court is considering. I appreciate what you have said to me, but this is a special circumstance given the pendency of that particular case.

That also—— 

Uh-huh. 

No, sir. I just haven’t reviewed Baker in a while, and so I actually don’t know what the status is. If it is the court’s precedent, as I’ve indicated in all of my answers, I will apply that precedent to the facts of any new situation that implicates it. 

Always the first question for a judge. 

The question on a marriage issue will be, two sides will come in. One will say Baker applies, another will say this court’s precedent applies to this factual situation, whatever the fac-tual situation is before the court. They’ll argue about what the meaning of that precedent is, how it applies to the regulation that’s at issue, and then the court will look at whatever it is that the State has done, what law it has passed on this issue of marriage, and decide, Okay, which precedent controls this outcome? It’s not that I’m attempting not to answer your question, Senator Grassley. I’m trying to explain the process that would be used Again, this question of how, and what is constitutional or not, or how a court will approach a case and what precedent to apply to it, is going to depend on what’s at issue before the court. Could the State do what it did?

I’m not on this because the holding of Baker v. Nelson is it’s holding. As a holding, it would control any similar issue that came up. It’s been a while since I’ve looked at that case so I can’t——

It’s been too long since I’ve looked at it. 

So it may have been, sir, as far back as law school, which was 30 years ago. 

Yeah. It was—I know that I looked at it, sir. 

That’s very similar to the Austin situation, but the ABA rules would not permit me to comment on the merits of a case that’s pending or impending before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has not addressed the constitutionality of that statute, and to the extent that lower courts have addressed it and made holdings, it is an impending case that could come before the Supreme Court. So, I can’t comment on the merits of that case.

I may have. But if your specific question is, have I done it with respect to a marriage-related issue——

No. 

I actually have no memory of doing so. 

No, I do not believe that judges should use their personal feelings, beliefs, or value systems or make their—to influence their outcomes, and neither do I believe that they should consider the gender, race, or ethnicity of any group that’s before them. I absolutely do not believe that. With respect to, yes, is the—is the goal of justice to be impartial, that is the central role of a judge. It—the judge is the impartial decision maker between parties who come before them. My speech was on something else, but I have no quarrel with the basic principles that you have asked me to recognize. 

Now, no quarrel sounds equivocal. They—I do believe in those things absolutely, and that’s what I have proven I do as a judge. 

No, sir. Absolutely not. 

The answer is, judges and—and the manner in which that question was responded to was, to the extent that there has been a violation of the Constitution in whatever manner of court identifies in a particular case, it has to try to remedy that situation in the most narrow way in order not to intrude on the functions of other branches or actors in the process. The case that I—was discussed in my history has been the Doe case, in which I joined the panel decision where the District Court had invalidated a statute that found unconstitutional a statute that the legislator—legislature had passed on national security letters. Our panel reviewed that situation and attempted to discern, and did discern, Congress’ intent to be that despite a—isolation provisions that might have to be narrowly construed to survive constitutional review, it held that the other provisions of the Act were constitutional. So the vast majority, contrary to what the District Court did— and I’m not suggesting it was intending to violate what I’m describing, but the court took a different view than the Circuit did—we upheld the statute in large measure. To the extent that we thought there were, and found that there were two provisions that were unconstitutional, we narrowly construed them in order to assist in effecting Congress’ intent. That’s what I talked about ‘‘limitedly’’ in that answer. 

No. That interpretation was clearly not my intent, and if—I don’t actually remember those particular words, but I do remember the speech. I’m assuming you’re talking about returning majesty to the law. And there I was talking about a broader set of questions, which was how to bring the public’s respect back to the function of judges.And I was talking about—that judges—that lawyers have an obligation to explain to the public the reasons why what seems unpredictable in the law has reasons, and I mentioned in that speech that one of the big reasons is that Congress makes new laws. That was the very first reason I discussed. And also that there’s new technology, there’s new developments in society, and what lawyers do is come in and talk to you about, okay, we’ve got these laws, how do you apply them to this new situation?And what judges do—and that’s why I was talking about the assistance of judges of lawyers—is what you do, is you look at the court’s precedent, you look at what a statute says and you try to understand the principles that are at issue and apply them to what the society is doing, and that was the focus of my speech, which was, talk to the public about the process. Don’t feed into their cynicism that judges are activists, that judges are making law. Work at explaining to the—to the public what the process is. I also talk to—part of my speech is what judges can do to help improve respect of the public in the legal process.

Right. 

No. And if you look at what I was talking about, it was, the society develops. 

We are not, today, what we were 100 years ago in terms of technology, medicine, so many different areas. There are new situations that arise and new facts that courts look at. You apply the law to those situations, but that is the process of judging which is sort of trying to figure out, what does the law say about a set of facts that may not have been imagined at the time of the founding of the Constitution, but it’s what the judge is facing then: how do you apply it to that? 

The basis of Mr. Didden’s lawsuit was, the State can’t take my property and give it to a private developer, and—because that is not consistent with the Takings Clause of the Constitution.To the extent he knew the State—and there’s no dispute about this—that the State had found a public use for his property, that it had a public purpose, that it had an agreement with a private developer to let that developer take the property, he knew that he was injured because his basic argument was, the State can’t do this. It can’t take my property and give it to a private developer.The Supreme Court, in Kelo, addressed that question and said under certain circumstances the State can do that if it’s for a public use and a public purpose. And so his lawsuit essentially addressing that question came 5 years after he knew what the State was doing. The issue of extortion was a question of whether the private developer, in setting a lawsuit with them, was engaging in extortion, and extortion is an unlawful asking of money with no basis. But the private developer had a basis. He had an agreement with the State. And so that is a different issue than the timeliness of Mr. Didden’s complaint.

As I indicated earlier, we don’t make policy choices. That means that I would think it inappropriate for a court to choose a case because—or a court—a judge to choose a case based on some sense of, I want this result on society. A judge takes a case to decide a legal issue, understanding its importance to an area of law and to arguments that parties are making about why it’s important.The question of—of impact is different than what a judge looks at, which is what’s the state of the law and this question, and how—and what clarity is needed, and other factors. But as I said, there’s a subtle but important difference in separating out and making choices based on policy and how you would like an issueto come out than a question that a judge looks at in terms of assessing the time at which a legal argument should be addressed.

There’s just no one factor that controls the choice where you say, I’m going to look at every case this way. As I said, judges in—in—well, I shouldn’t talk because I haven’t—I’m not there.

But my understanding of the process is that it’s not based on those policy implications of an outcome. 

It’s based on a different question than that. 

I—I don’t mean to be funny, but the court has held that it’s fundamental in the sense of incorporation against the States. [Laughter.] Judge SOTOMAYOR. But it is a very important and central part of our democratic society that we do give freedom of religion, of practice of religion, that the Constitution restricts the—the State from establishing a religion, and that we have freedom of expression and speech as well. Those freedoms are central to our Constitution. The four cases, others that I have rendered in this area, recognize the importance of that in terms of one’s consideration of actions that are being taken to restrict it in a particular circumstance. Speaking further is difficult to do, again, because of the role of a judge. To say it’s important, that it’s fundamental, that it’s legal in common meaning, is always looked at in the context of a particular case. What’s the State doing? In the Ford case that you just mentioned, the question there before the court was, did the District Court err in considering whether or not the religious belief that this prisoner had was consistent412 with the established traditional interpretation of a meal at issue? Okay.And what I was doing was applying very important Supreme Court precedent that said it’s the subjective belief of the individual. Is it really motivated by a religious belief? That’s one of the reasons we recognize conscientious objectors, because we’re asking a court not to look at whether this is orthodox or not, but to look at the sincerity of the individual’s religious belief and then look at what the State is doing in light of that. So that was what the issue was in Ford.

Good morning. 

Senator, I was—let me place the Ricci decision back in context. The issue was whether or not employees who were a member of a disparately impacted group had a right under existing precedent to bring a lawsuit. Did they have a right to bring a lawsuit on the basis of prima facie case and what would that consist of?That was established Second Circuit precedent and had been, at least up to that point, concluded from Supreme Court precedents describing the initial burden that employees had. That was——

Exactly. Exactly, which is, when you speak about a right to bring a lawsuit, I mean what’s the minimum amount of good-faith evidence do they have to actually file the complaint. And established precedent said you can make out, an em-ployee, a prima facie case of a violation of Title VII under just merely by—not ‘‘merely.’’ That’s denigrating it. By showing a disparate impact.Then the city was faced with the choice of, OK, we’re now facing two claims, one——

The question was the precedent that existed and whether, viewing it, one would view this as the city discriminating on the basis of race or the city concluding that because it was unsure that its test actually avoided disparate impact but still tested for necessary qualifications, was it discriminating on the basis of race by not certifying the test?

It’s not that I disagree. The question was a more focused one that the Court was looking at, which was saying—not more focused. It was a different look. It was saying, OK, you have got these precedents. It says employees can sue the city. The city is now facing liability. It is unsure whether it can defeat that liability. And so it decides not to certify the test and see if it could come up with one that would still measure the necessary qualifications——

It was the ones that we discussed yesterday, the Bushey line of cases that talked about the prima facie case and the obligations of the city in terms of defending lawsuits claiming disparate impact. And so the question then became: How do you view the city’s action? Was it—and that’s what the district court had done in its 78-page opinion to say you have got a city facing liability——

The panel acted in accordance with its views by setting forth and incorporating the district court’s analysis of the case. Those who disagreed with the opinion made their arguments. Those who agreed that en banc certification wasn’t necessary voted their way, and the majority of the court decided not to hear the case en banc.I can’t speak for why the others did or did not take the positions they did. Some of them issued opinions. Others joined opinions.

That was what we did in terms of the decision, which was to accept the—not accept but incorporate the district court’s decision analyzing the case and saying we agreed with it. 

Perhaps it is just one bit of background needs to be explained. When a court incorporates, as we did in a per curiam, a district court decision below, it does become the court’s precedent. And, in fact, when I—— 

Yes, but when I was on the district court, I issued also a lengthy decision on an issue, a constitutional issue, a direct constitutional issue, that the circuit had not addressed and very few other courts had addressed on the question of whether AEDPA’s statute of limitations on habeas were—— 

As I explained, when the circuit court incorporated the district court’s opinion, that became the court’s holding. 

So it did become circuit holding. With respect to—— 

With respect—yes. I’m sorry. With respect to the question of precedent, it must be remembered that what the Supreme Court did in Ricci was say: There isn’t much law on howto approach this. Should we adopt a standard different than the circuit did? Because it is a question that we must decide, how to approach this issue to ensure that two provisions of Title VII are consistent with each other.That argument of adopting a different test was not the one that was raised before us, but that was raised clearly before the Supreme Court. And so that approach is different than saying that the outcome that we came to was not based on our understanding of what it made out a prima facie case.

Actually, they did in one case I handled when I was a district court judge.

I don’t know how you define ‘‘typical,’’ but if the district court opinion in the judgment of the panel is adequate and fulsome and persuasive, they do. In my Rodriguez v. Artuz case, when I was at district court, on the constitutionality of an act by Congress with respect to the Suspension Clause of the habeas provision, the court did it in less than a paragraph. They just incorporated my decision as the law of the circuit or the holding of the circuit. 

As I argued—argued. As I stated earlier, the issue for us, no, we weren’t endorsing that result. We were just talking about what the Supreme Court recognized, which was that there was a good-faith basis for the city to act. It set a standard that was new, not argued before us below, and that set forth how to balance those considerations. That is part of what the Court does in the absence of a case previously decided that sets forth the test. And what the Court there said is good faith is not enough.

Substantial evidence is what the city has to rely on. Those are different types of questions. 

Yes. But I didn’t—that wasn’t the question we were looking at. We were looking at a more narrow question, which was: Could a city in good faith say we’re trying to comply with the law, we don’t know what standard to use, we have good faith for believing that we should not certify? Now the Supreme Court has made clear what standard they should apply. Those are different issues. 

It’s difficult because there were a lot of opinions in that case, but the engagement among the judges was varied on different levels. And the first engagement that the dissent didwith the majority was saying if you are going to apply this new test, this new standard, then you should give the circuit court an opportunity to evaluate the evidence——

I don’t believe that’s how I read the dissent. It may have to speak for itself, but I—Justice Ginsburg took the position that the Second Circuit’s panel opinion should be affirmed, and she took it by saying that no matter how you looked at this case, it should be affirmed. And so I don’t believe that—that was my conclusion reading the dissent, but obviously it will speak for itself.

I think we are in full agreement. When precedent is set, it is set—it follows the rule of law. And in all of the speeches where I have discussed this issue, I have described the differences between the two courts as one where precedents are set,that the precedents have policy ramifications, but not in the meaning that the legislature gives to it.The legislature gives it a meaning in terms of making law. When I am using that term, it is very clear that I am talking about having a holding, it becomes precedent, and it binds other courts. You are following the rule of law when you are doing that.

Yes. 

It was. 

That was my understanding. 

It is essentially a unanimous opinion where the court is taking an Act where it is not saying more than either incorporating a decision by the court below, because it is not adding anything to it. 

In some cases, it is when there is—Judge Cabranes in his dissent pointed out in some cases it is simply used to denote that an issue is so clear and unambiguous that we are just going to—the law. It can be used in a variety of different ways, but it is generally where you are doing something fairly—in a very cursory fashion either because a District Court judge has done a thorough job—— 

I keep saying 78 because that is what I—— 

And as I said, my circuit did that in a case where I addressed as a District Court judge a case of first impression on a direct constitutional issue, the suspension clause. Or it can have—one of the meanings can be that given by Judge Cabranes.

I am. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I would agree that it was precedent. I will not choose to quarrel with the Supreme Court’s description of the situation. 

I chose the law because it is more suited to that part of me that has never sought the kind of attention that other public figures get.When I was in law school, some of my friends thought I would go into the political arena not knowing that what I sought was more the life of a judge, the thinking involved in that and the process of the rule of law.My career as a judge has shown me that regardless of what my desires were, that my life, what I have accomplished, does serve as an inspiration for others. It is a sort of awesome sense of responsibility. It is one of the reasons that I do so many activities with people in the community. Not just Latinas, but all groups because I understand that it is women, it is Latinas, it is immigrants.It is all kinds and all backgrounds. Each one of us faces challenges in their life. Whether you were born rich or poor, of any color or background, life’s challenges place hurdles every day.One of the wonderful parts of the courage of America is that we overcome them. I think that people have taken that sense that on some levels I have done some of that at various stages in my life.So for me, I understand my responsibility. That is why I understand and have tried as much as I can to reach out to all different kinds of groups and to make myself available as much as I can. Often I have to say no, otherwise I’d never work. But I meet my responsibilities and work very hard at my job, but I also know I have a responsibility to reach out.

Absolutely, sir. I understand the Constitution. 

I am, applied in different situations. 

Correct. 

That was the decision and it is what the court has held, and so it is unquestionably an individual right. 

No, sir. 

The rule of law. 

No. In fact, the question that you raise, is it fundamental in the sense of the law. 

That is a legal term. It’s very different and it is important to remember that the Supreme Court’s precedent on the Second Amendment predated its more closely developed—— 

Well, there’s not a cookbook, but there’s precedent that was established after the older precedent that has talked and described that doctrine of incorporation. That’s a set of precedents that—— 

Yes. Well, no. The 1890 case was the Supreme Court’s holding on this issue. But since that time, there has been a number of number of decisions discussing the incorporation doctrine, applying it to different provisions of the Constitution. 

Well, you hire judges for their judgment, not their personal views or what their sense of what the outcome should be. You hire your point judges for the purpose of understanding whether they respect law, whether they respect precedent and apply it in a—— 

The issue will be controlled by the court’s analysis of that question in the case, fundamental as defined by incorporation, in—likely will be looked at by the court in a case that challenges a state regulation. At that point, I would presume that the court will look at its older precedent in the way it did in Heller, consider whether it controls the issue or not. It will decide, even if it controls it, whether it should be revisited under the doctrine of stare decisis. It could decide it doesn’t control and that would be its decision. It could decide it does control, but it should revisit it. In revisiting it, it will look at a variety of different factors, among them, havethere been changes in related areas of law that would counsel questioning this.As I’ve indicated, there was a lot of law after the older cases on incorporation. I suspect, but I don’t know, because I can’t prejudge the issue, that the court will consider that with all of the other arguments that the parties will make.

Politics based simply on a person’s characteristics, generally referred to either race or ethnicity or gender, religion. It is politics based on——

Personally, I don’t, as a judge, in any way embrace it with respect to judging. As a person, I do believe thatcertain groups have and should express their views on whatever social issues may be out there.But as I understand the word ‘‘identity politics,’’ it’s usually denigrated because it suggests that individuals are not considering what’s best for America, and that I don’t believe in.I think that whatever a group advocates, obviously, it advocates on behalf of its interests and what the group thinks it needs, but I would never endorse a group advocating something that was contrary to some basic constitutional right as it was known at the time, although people advocate changes in the law all the time.

I think my speeches embrace the concept that I just described, which is, groups, you have interests that you should seek to promote; what you’re doing is important in helping the community develop; participate, participate in the process of your community; participate in the process of helping to change the conditions you live in.I don’t describe it as identity politics, because it’s not that I’m advocating that groups do something illegal.

To promote the civil rights and equal opportunity of Hispanics in the United States.

I can’t answer that question, because I didn’t review the briefs. I did know that the fund had a health care——

The question in 1991—— 

1981, I misspoke about the year, was an advocacy by the fund, taking a position on whether legislation by the State of New York outlawing or permitting the death penalty should be adopted by the State. I thank you for recognizing that my decisions have not shown me to be an advocate on behalf of any group. That is a different, dramatically different question than whether I follow the law. And in the one case I had as a district court judge, I followed the law completely. 

Yes. 

Yes. 

I regret that I have offended some people. I believe that my life demonstrates that that was not my intent to leave the impression that some have taken from my words.

I sustained—well, I rejected the challenges of the defendant that the application of the death penalty to him was based on race, yes.

Wholeheartedly. 

Well, I can’t speak to why others decided to pass on the case. I can talk to you about my views at the time. The New York Court of Appeals had invalidated the New York statute on child pornography on the ground of a constitutional violation, Federal constitutional violation, that the statute did not comport with the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court took that case directly from the court of appeals, as is its right to review all issues of Federal constitutionallaw, and reversed the New York Court of Appeals and reinstated the statute.My sense is because there were still so many open questions about both the legality of the statute and the question of the difficulty in proving the particular crime at issue that involved two men who worked in a change of—chain of adult bookstores in the then-Times Square area. Times Square has changed dramatically since that time.It was mostly circumstantial. We had some tapes, but their knowledge of what those tapes contained, their intent to sell and distribute child pornography involving children below a certain age—it was a difficult, difficult legal and factual case. But it was clear that it was a serious case. We’re talking about the distribution of films that show children who were anywhere from 8 years old to 12 years old being explicitly sexually abused. And it seemed to me that, regardless of the outcome of the case, whether I secured the convictions or not, whether it was held up on appeal or not, that the issues it raised had to be presented in court because of the importance of the crime.And so I brought the prosecution. I had a co-counsel in that case who was second-seating me in that case, meaning she was assisting me. And the case took a while at trial because, as I said, it was circumstantial.The jury returned a verdict against both defendants. They were sentenced quite severely, and the cases held up on appeal. It was an enormously complicated case. I assisted in the appeal because it was so complicated that one of the heads of the Appeals Division of the New York County District Attorney’s Office had to become involved in it. But the convictions were sustained.And so the effort resulted in a conviction of two men who were distributing films that had the vilest of sexual acts portrayed against children.

As I have indicated, the role of a judge is to look at Congress’ words in a statute and discern its intent. And in cases that present new facts, you must take existing precedents and apply the teachings of those precedents to those new facts.In the Giordano case, there had not been another situation quite like this one. This was a mayor who, working through a woman, secured sexual acts by very young girls that were taking place in his office. And through the woman he was working with and also through his own exhortations, ‘‘Don’t tell anybody, you’ll get into trouble,’’ and the woman’s exhortations to the child, the person he was conspiring with, that they would get in trouble with the police because the police wouldn’t believe them, they would believe him because he was a mayor, the question for the court became: Is that acting under color of State law? Is he using his office to promote this illegal activity against these young girls?The majority, viewing these facts, said yes, that’s the principles we discern from precedent about what the use of State law means—of acting under State law means.The dissent disagreed and it disagreed using its own rationale about why the law should not be read that way. But these are cases that rely upon an understanding both of what the words say and how precedent has interpreted them, and that’s what the majority of the panel did in that case.

I can’t live my life to write history’s story. That will be the job of historians long after I’m gone. Some of them start now, but long after I’m gone.In the end, I hope it will say I’m a fair judge, that I was a caring person, and that I lived my life serving my country.

Good morning, Senator. 

I have, sir, and every Senator on both sides of the aisle that have made that promise to me have kept it fully. 

I would tell them to look at my decisions for 17 years and note that in every one of them, I have done what I say that I so firmly believe in. I prove my fidelity to the law, the fact that I do not permit personal views, sympathies or prejudices to influence the outcome of cases, rejecting the challenges of numerous plaintiffs with undisputably sympathetic claims, but ruling the way I have on the basis of law, rejecting those claims.I would ask them to look at the speeches completely, to read what their context was and to understand the background of those issues that are being discussed.I didn’t disagree with what I understood was the basic premise that Justice O’Connor was making, which was that being a man or a woman doesn’t affect the capacity of someone to judge fairly or wisely. What I disagreed was with the literal meaning of her words because neither of us meant the literal meaning of our words.My use of her words was pretty bad in terms of leaving a bad impression, but both of us were talking about the value of experience and the fact that it gives you equal capacity.In the end, I would tell your constituents, Senators, look at my record and understand that my record talks about who I am as a person, what I believe in, and my judgment and my opinion, that following the rule of law is the foundation of our system of justice.

Senator, that question is so embedded with its answer, isn’t it? Meaning if the court rules one way and I say that is making law, then it forecasts that I have a particular view of whatever arguments may be made on this issue suggesting that it is interpreting the Constitution.I understand the seriousness of this question. I understand the seriousness of same sex marriage. But I also know as I think all America knows, that this issue is being hotly debated on every level of our three branches of government. It is being debated in Congress and Congress has passed an Act relating to same sex marriage. It is being debated on various courts on the state level, certain higher courts have made rulings.This is the type of situation where even the characterizing of whatever the court may do as one way or another suggests that I have both prejudged an issue and that I come to that issue with my own personal views suggesting an outcome. Neither is true. I would look at that issue in the context of a case that came before me with a completely open mind.

Oh, no. It is a very important distinction. The laws are written by Congress. It makes factual findings, it determines in its judgment what the fit is between the law it is passing and the remedy that it is giving as a right.The courts when they are interpreting always has to start with what does the Constitution say? What is the words of the Constitution? How has precedent interpreted those? What are the principles that it has discussed govern a particular situation?

In both cases in which I have used that word in two different speeches, one was a speech, one was a remark to students. This is almost like the discussion about fundamental, what does it mean to a non- lawyer and fundamental what it means in the context of Supreme Court legal theory.

Not love, but in the context in both contexts. It is very, very clear that I am talking about completely the difference between the two judgings and that Circuit Courts when they issue a holding, it becomes precedent on all similar cases.In both comments, that statement was made absolutely expressly that that was the context of the policy I was talking about which is the ramifications of a precedent on all similar cases.When Congress talks about policy, it is talking about something totally different. It is talking about making law, what are the choices that I am going to make in making the law. Those are two different things.I was not talking about courts making law. In fact, in the Duke speech, I used making policy in terms of its ramifications on existing cases. I never said in either speech we make law in the sense that Congress would.

The context of that statement was a question about what was perking through the legal system at the time it has been, as you know, before the Supreme Court since Buckley v. Valeo.

The question is a contributor seeking to influence or to buy someone’s vote, and there are situations in which elected officials have been convicted of taking a bribe because theyhave agreed in exchange for a sum of money to vote on a particular legislation in a particular way.That violates the Federal law. The question that was discussed there was a much broader question as to where do you draw that line as a society? What choices do you think about in terms of what Congress will do, what politicians will do.I have often spoken about the difference between what the law permits and what individuals should use to guide their conduct.The fact that the law says that you can do this doesn’t always mean that you as a person should choose to do this. In fact, we operate within the law, we should not be a law breaker, but you should act in situations according to that sense of what is right or wrong.We have the recent case that the Supreme Court considered of the judge who was given an extraordinary amount of money by a campaign contributor dwarfing everything else in his campaign in terms of contributions, funding a very expensive campaign.

Well, it was not a direct contribution, but it was a question there where the Supreme Court said the appearance of impropriety in this case would have counseled the judge the get off.

That was not what I was talking about in that speech.

No, sir. No, sir. 

The best way to live in our society is to follow the command of the Constitution, provide equal opportunity for all. I follow what the Constitution says, that is how the law should be structured and how it should be applied to whatever individual circumstances come before the court.

The question of agreeing or disagreeing suggests an opinion on what the ruling was in the case that he used it in. I accept the court’s ruling in that case. That was a very recent case.There is no quarrel that I have, no disagreement. I do not accept that in that situation that statement the court found applied. I just said the issue is a constitutional one, equal opportunity for all under the law.

I think every American agrees with that. 

It most certainly does. 

I don’t judge on the basis of ideology. I judge on the basis of the law and my reasoning. That’s how I have comported myself in the circuit court. When my colleagues and I, in many cases, have initially come to disagreeing positions, we’ve discussed them and either persuaded each other, changed each other’s minds, and worked from the starting point of arguing, discussing, exchanging perspectives on what the law commands.

Well, I am bound by precedent to the extent that all precedence is entitled to the respect it—to respect under the doctrine of stare decisis. And to the extent that the Supreme Court has addressed this issue of cost-benefit and its permissibility under the Clean Water Act, that’s the holding I would apply to any new case that came and the framework—it establishes the framework I would employ to new cases.

It does appear that the Supreme Court’s docket has lessened over time, its decisions that it’s addressing. Because of that, it certainly does appear that it has the capacity to accept more cases.And the issue of circuit splits is one of the factors that the court’s own local rules set out as a consideration for justices to think about in the cert process.So in answer to your question, the direct answer is, yes, it does appear that it has the capacity.

I would probably do what Justice Alito did, although I haven’t decided, if I’m given the honor of becoming a member of the Supreme Court, I haven’t decided anything. I’m not even sure where I would live in New York if this were to happen— in Washington.But putting that aside, Senator, my approach would probably be similar to Justice Alito, which is experience the process, take, for a period of time, consider its costs and benefits, and then whether to try the alternative or not and figure out what I think works best in terms of the functioning of my chambers and the court.I can’t give a definitive answer, because I generally try to keep an open mind until I experience something and can then speak from knowledge about whether to change it or not.

My experience was limited. So I can’t speak to the more broad conclusion of that report. I can say that, as we discussed when I met with you, Senator, mine was positive.In the two cases—I believe I only had two cases where the media asked to record a proceeding. I may not remember others, but I doremember two. And on the circuit court, we do provide tapes upon request and some media has asked to record our oral arguments.But my experience has generally been positive and I would certainly be able to recount that.

I would certainly relay my experiences. To the extent some of them may not know about the pilot study in many courts, I would share that with them, although I suspect they do know, and will participate in discussions with them on this issue. Those things I would do, Senator. 

It was and I understand, having reviewed Justice Easterbrook’s opinion, that he agreed with the reasoning of Maloney on that point.

Senator, obviously, issues related to September 11 and national security are very important issues to the country as a whole. For the reasons I mentioned earlier, I lived through September 11, so I understand its great tragedy and effect on America.The question you asked me, though, is one that asks me to make judgment about an act the Supreme Court has done and I didn’t participate in their discussions. I didn’t review the cert petitions. I didn’t talk about with them their reasons.It would seem and is inappropriate to me to comment on a question that I wasn’t a party to in making the decision.

All conflicts under the Constitution, all issues arising from the Constitution are important.

It is so difficult to answer that question in the abstract. For the reason I’ve just explained, the issue is much, much more complicated than an absolute that says if a case presents this question, I’m always going to take it.That’s not how a judge looks at the issue of granting or not granting certiorari, I assume, because the court is weighing so many different factors at the time that decision is made.

Good morning. 

I will not use foreign law to interpret the Constitution or American statutes. I will use American law, constitutional law to interpret those laws, except in the situations where American law directs a court. 

It would be presumptuous of me to tell you how to do your job, but I do know in my conversations virtually with all 89 Senators—perhaps not all of them, but the vast majority of them, somewhere in the conversation there was reference to their feelings, like yours, that a better job could be done by Congress in making its intent clearer. I think that that’s a question that Senators think about, at least the ones that I’ve spoken to.And I think that the process is always better for a court when Congress’ intent is more clearly stated.

When Congress’ intent is clear, the Court applies that clear intent.

All right. That language has been used in certain cases respecting the question of the incorporation of certain amendments. The question of—and the general framework will be used with respect to any consideration of incorporation. That wasn’t, I thought, the question that was being asked of me. I don’t remember that being the specific question. All I’m saying to you is that the framework has been discussed by the Court in jurisprudence that’s developed over the last hundred years, subsequent to its established precedents on the Second Circuit.One of the questions that the Court will address if it decides to address the incorporation of the Second Amendment is whether in those related areas it will use or not use the doctrines or framework of that precedent. There may be arguments on one side why, on another side why not. What I’m trying to do is not prejudge an issue that is so pending before the——

Because that’s the very issue the Court’s going to look at. The question of stare decisis is a general framework that one uses not in a particular context of a case, I am going to choose always to look at the outcome of the case in this way. It’s——

The only statement I can start with is Maloney was decided on the basis of precedent. It was decided on precedent. The Supreme Court in Heller recognized that it’s precedent. It was based on Second Circuit precedent that had interpreted the constitutional—the Supreme Court’s prior precedent.It may well be—may not be—that Senator Hatch was right that the old precedent should be distinguished in a certain way. Others may be right that it shouldn’t. That issue was not the one that the Maloney court decided Maloney on. It decided it on the rule of law. It was a rule of law that led Judge Easterbrook in the Seventh Circuit decision to say it is not what we should be doing; it is what the Supreme Court should do, is to re-examine a precedent that’s directly on point.I can assure your constituents that I have a completely open mind on this question. I do not close my mind to the fact and the understanding that there were developments after the Supreme Court’s rulings on incorporation that will apply to this question or be considered. I have a completely open mind.

Senator, would you want a judge or a nominee who came in here and said, ‘‘I agree with you. This is unconstitutional’’ before I had a case before me, before I had both sides discussing the issue with me, before I spent the time that the Supreme Court spent on the Heller decision? And that decision was mighty long, went through 2 years of history, did a very thorough analysis and discussion back and forth on the prior opinions of the Committee. I don’t know that that’s a Justice that I can be. I can only come to this process——

I understand the importance of the right. It was recognized in Heller, and all I can continue to say, Senator, is I keep an open mind on the incorporation doctrine.

That women have the right to terminate their pregnancy in some situations, without Government regulation, and in others, there would be permissible Government regulation.

That’s generally, because the Court did look at other questions in terms of Government regulation. 

I don’t know that I could answer that question because I don’t—— 

Senator, I don’t actually remember the Court addressing that because my studies have been on the undue burden test established in Casey. So my experience in this area or my knowledge really has been most particularly concentrated on the Casey standard, which is—— 

I understood that that was the Court’s framework for addressing both the woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy under the Constitution and the State’s rights to legislate and regulate in areas within its jurisdiction. So it was the Court’s way of attempting to address those two interests.

No. 

That I can’t answer. I—— 

I can only answer what exists. People are very passionate about the issues they believe in, and so almost any issue could find an audience or a part of our population that’s fervent about it. 

In the first instance, it’s always Congress or State passing regulation that the Court is reviewing and determining whether it complies with constitutional limits. It’s not a choice of either/or. It’s always Congress’ first instance or the State legislators’ first interest with the non-veto of a——

Thank you, Senator. 

You are going to hate me for taking a few minutes, but can I tell you a story? 

Because it will explain who I am and why. When Senator Moynihan first told me that he would consider sending my name to Senator D’Amato for consideration as a District Court judge, he asked me to keep it quiet for a little bit of time and I asked permission to tell my mom, Omar. This is short. So they were visiting and I told them and mom was very, very excited. She then said how much more money are you going to earn? I stopped and I said I’m going to take a big pay cut. Then she stopped and she stopped and she said, are you going to do as much foreign travel as you do now? I was flying all over the U.S. and abroad as part of my private practice work. I said probably not because I am going to live in a courthouse in lower Manhattan near where I used to work as a Manhattan DA. Now the pause was a little longer. She said, Okay. Then she said, now all the fascinating clients that you work with, as you may have heard yesterday, I had some fairly well known clients, you are going to be able to go traveling with them with the new people you meet, right?I said, no. Most of them are going to come before me as litigants to the cases I am hearing and I cannot become friends with them. Now the pause is really long. She finally looked up and she said, why do you want this job?And Omar, who was sitting next to her said, Selena, you know your daughter. This is in Spanish. You know your daughter and her stuff with public service. It really has always been the answer.Given who I am, my love of the law, my sense of importance about the rule of law, how central it is to the functioning of our society, how it sets us apart as many Senators have noted, from the rest of the world, have always created a passion in me.That passion led me to want to be a lawyer first and now to be a judge because I can’t think of any greater service that I can give to the country than to be permitted the privilege of being a Justice of the Supreme Court.

I have been living on the salary for 17 years, so I will suffer through more of it. It is difficult for many judges. The pay question is a significant one for judges who haven’t received pay raises I think it is more than 20 years now if I am not mistaken.

Sir, no. I didn’t show a lack of courage. The court’s decision was clear in both instances on the basis for the decision. It was a thorough, complete discussion of the issues as presented to the District Court. The Circuit Court’s ruling was clear in both instances. No, I did not lack courage.

No, sir. 

No, sir. 

No. 

I was not like Justice Ginsburg or Justice Marshall. I was not a lawyer on the Fund as they were with respect to the organizations they belong to. I was a board member and it was not my practice and not that I know of any board member, although maybe one with Civil Rights experience would have. I didn’t have any in this area, so I never reviewed the briefs. 

No. No specific brief. Obviously it was involved in litigation, so I knew generally they were filing briefs. But I wouldn’t know until after the fact that the brief was actually filed. But I wouldn’t review it. 

No because I never reviewed the brief. 

For the same reason, no. 

No, that’s not the role of the courts. The role of the courts is to interpret the law as Congress writes it. It may be the effect in a particular situation that in the court doing that and giving effect to Congress’ intent, it has that outcome. But it is not the role of the judge to create that outcome. It is to interpret what Congress is doing and do what Congress wants. 

Text and history, how to analyze, yes. 

Yes. 

It is fair to me to say that I do not view what a court does as activism. I view it as each judge principally interpreting the issue before them on the basis of the law. 

What governs always is the Constitution. 

The intent of the founders were set forth in the Constitution. They created the words, they created the document. It is their words that is the most important aspect of judging. You follow what they said in their words and you apply it to the facts you are looking at.

As I indicated yesterday, I didn’t remember Baker, and if I had studied it, it would have been in law school. You raised a question, and I did go back to look at Baker. In fact, I don’t think I ever read it, even in law school. Baker was decided at the time where jurisdiction over Federal questions was mandatory before the Supreme Court, and the disposition by the Supreme Court, I believe was what you related, Senator, which is a dismissal of the appeal raised on the Minnesota statute. What I have learned is the question of—it’s what the meaning of that dismissal is, is actually an issue that’s being debated in existing litigation. As I indicated yesterday, I will follow precedent according to the doctrine of stare decisis. I can’t prejudge what that precedent means until the issue comes before—what a prior decision of the Court means and its applicability to a particular issue is until that question is before me as a judge—or a Justice, if that should happen. So, at bottom, because the question is pending before a number of courts, the ABA would not permit me to comment on the merits of that. But as I indicated, I affirm that with each holding of the Court, to the extent it is pertinent to the issues before the Court, it has to be given the effects of stare decisis. 

Well, those cases have holdings that are not open to dispute. The holdings are what they are. Their application to a particular situation will differ on what facts those situations present. The same thing with the Nelson case, which is what does the holding mean, and that’s what I understand is being litigated, because it was a one-line decision by the Supreme Court, and how it applies to a new situation is what also would come before a court.

Senator Grassley, one of the things I say to my students when I’m teaching brief writing, I start by saying to them, ‘‘It’s very dangerous to use analogies because they’re always imperfect.’’ I wouldn’t ever use Justice Souter’s words because they’re his words, not mine.I try always to use—and this is what I tell my students to do, is use simple words. Explain what you’re doing without analogy. Just tell them what you’re doing. And what I do is not described in the way—or I wouldn’t describe it in the way Justice Souter did.Judges apply the law, they apply the holdings of precedent, and they look at how that fits into the new facts before them. But you’re not creating law. If that was an intent that Justice Souter was expressing—and I doubt it—that’s not what judges do. Judges do what I’ve just described, and that’s not in my mind acting for Congress. It is interpreting Congress’ intent as expressed in a statute and applying it to the new situation.

Senator, after each round, I go to the next moment. Without actually looking at the transcript, I couldn’t answer that question. It is just impossible to right now. I’m glad you’re giving me the opportunity, but I would need a specific question as to something I said and what I meant before I could respond.

Thank you, sir. 

I did not hold it was not incorporated. I was on a panel that—— 

You can’t talk in an absolute. There always has to be a reason for why a State acts, and there also has to be a reason for the extent of the regulation the State passes. And so the question in Maloney for us was a very narrow question, which was: Are these nunchuk sticks—and I have described them previously as these martial arts sticks tied together by a belt that when you swing them, if somebody comes by, there could be, if not serious, deadly force in some situations—whether the State had a reason recognized in law for determining that it was illegal to own those sticks.The next issue that would come up by someone who challenged the regulation would be, What’s the nature of the regulation and how does it comport with the reason the State gives for the actions it did?So absolute regulation is not what I would answer. I would answer what this——

Well, that’s very similar, although not exactly, if I understood it, to Heller, the facts in Heller. And the Court there said that the regulation in D.C. was broader than the interest asserted. That question in a different State would depend on the circumstances of its barring—— 

In Maloney, the Court addressed whether there was a violation of the equal protection statute—equal protection of the 14th Amendment, and determined that rational basis review—now that I understand that you are asking about—— 

I’m not going to be difficult with you. It’s the one where you don’t need an exact fit between the exact injury that you are seeking to remedy in the legislation. 

So it does have more—— 

Well, ‘‘flexibility’’ is the wrong—more deference to congressional findings about what—— 

Exactly. 

It’s a fair characterization that when you have strict scrutiny, the Government’s legislation must be very narrowly tailored.

In rational basis there is a broader breadth for the States to act. 

That’s the problem within the abstract, because what the Court would look at is whatever legislature—State legislative findings there are in the fit between those findings and the legislation. 

Well, the standard of review, even under the incorporation doctrine, was actually not decided in Heller, and that issue wasn’t resolved. So what that answer will be is actually an open question that I couldn’t even discuss in a broad term other than to just explain—— 

Very clear to me from the public discussions on this issue that that is a concern for many people. 

I can’t speak for what they did. I can only do what you did, which is to describe what the courts did and what they said. It’s impossible for me to speak about why a particular court acted in a particular way or why a particular Justice analyzed an issue outside of what the opinion says.

I do not believe that foreign law should be used to determine the result under constitutional law or American law, except where American law directs.

I have. 

When you’re talking about civilian criminal law, you’re talking about—— 

After conviction, defendants are often sentenced—— 

The Speedy Trial Act and there are constitutional principles that require a speedy trial. So in answer, no, there is no—— 

There, you have an advantage on me, because I—I’m sorry. 

I can only answer that question narrowly, and narrowly because the court’s holdings have been narrow in this area. First, military commissions and proceedings under them have been a part of the country’s history. And so there’s no question that they are appropriate in certain circumstances.

Thank you, Senator. 

In every single case, and Senator Graham gave the example in his opening statement, there are two parties arguing different perspectives on what the law means. That’s what litigation is about. And what the judge has to do is choose the perspective that’s going to apply to that outcome. So there is a choice. You’re going to rule in someone’s favor. You’re going to rule against someone’s favor. That’s the perspective of the lack of neutrality. It’s that you can’t just throw up your hands and say I’m not going to rule. Judges have to choose the answer to the question presented to the court. And so that’s what that part of my talking was about, that there is choice in judging. You have to rule. 

I think both were looking at the legal issue before them, looking at the text of the Second Amendment, looking at its history, looking at the court’s precedent over time and trying to answer the question that was before them. 

I don’t use that word for judging. I eschew labels of any kind. That’s why I don’t like analogies and why I prefer, in brief-writing, to talk about judges interpreting the law. 

I don’t describe people’s actions with those labels. 

Stand by both, because the speech made very clear, in any number of places, where I said you can’t use it to interpret the Constitution or American law. I went through—not a lengthy, because it was a shorter speech, but I described the situations in which American law looks to foreign law by its terms, meaning it’s counseled by American law.My part of the speech said people misunderstand what the word ‘‘use’’ means and I noted that ‘‘use’’ appears to people to mean if you cite a foreign decision, that means it’s controlling an outcome or that you are using it to control an outcome, and I said no.You think about foreign law as a—and I believe my words said this. You think about foreign law the way judges think about all sources of information, ideas, and you think about them as ideas both from law review articles and from state court decisions and from all the sources, including Wikipedia, that people think about ideas. Okay.They don’t control the outcome of the case. The law compels that outcome and you have to follow the law. But judges think. We engage in academic discussions. We talk about ideas.Sometimes you will see judges who choose—I haven’t, it’s not my style, but there are judges who will drop a footnote and talk about an idea. I’m not thinking that they’re using that idea to compel a result. It’s an engagement of thought.But the outcome—you could always find an exception, I assume, if I looked hard enough, but in my review, judges are applying American law.

I don’t know why other judges do it. As I explained, I haven’t. But I look at the structure of what the judge has done and explains and go by what that judge tells me. There are situations—that’s as far as I can go.

To me, I am a part academic. Please don’t forget that I taught at two law schools. I do speak more than I should and I think about ideas all the time. And so for me, it’s fun to think about ideas.You sit in a lunchroom among judges and you’ll often hear them say, ‘‘Did you see what that law school professor said’’ or ‘‘did yousee what some other judge wrote and what do you think about it,’’ but it’s just talking. It’s sharing ideas.What you’re doing in each case, and that’s what my speech said, is you can’t use foreign law to determine the American Constitution. It can’t be used either as a holding or precedent.

In that regard, the Constitution is abundantly clear. There is an amendment process set forth. It controls how you change the Constitution.

We have no disagreement. 

The Supreme Court, in these two rulings or one, has said there are limits to all powers set forth in the Constitution and the question for the court in any particular situation is to determine whether whatever branch of government or state is acting within the limits of the Constitution. 

One of the beauties of our Constitution is the very question that you ask me, is the dialog that’s left in the first instance to this body and to the House of Representatives.The answer to that question is not mine in the abstract. The answer to that question is a discussion that this legislative body will come to an answer about as reflected in laws it will pass. And once it passes those laws, there may be individuals who have rights to challenge those laws and will come to us and ask us to examine what the Constitution says about what Congress did.But it is the great beauty of this nation that we do leave the lawmaking to our elected branches and that we expect our courts to understand its limited role, but important role in ensuring that the Constitution is upheld in every situation that’s presented to it.

That’s almost a judgment call. I don’t know how to answer your question, because it would seem like it would lead to the natural question, did the courts do this in this case, and that would be opining on a particular view of the case. And that case would have a holding and I would have to look at that holding in the context of another case.I’m attempting to answer your question, Senator, but our roles and the ones we choose to serve, your job is wonderful. It is so, soimportant. But I love that you’re doing your job and I love that I’m doing my job as a judge. I like mine better.

I answer the way that those two justices did, which is I would consider the rule of the fifth vote in the way it has been practiced by the court. It has a sensible basis, which is that if you don’t grant the stay, an execution can happen before you reach the question of whether to grant certiorari or not.

Unquestionably. As I said, there is an underlying reason for that practice.

Yes, sir. 

Thank you, Senators, to all Senators. I have received all the graciousness and fair hearing that I could have asked for and I thank you, Senator, for your participation in this process and in ensuring that. 

Thank you all.
