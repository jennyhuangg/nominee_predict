Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one or two very.minor corrections in the biography that you have distributed.The CHAMMAN. All right, sir.Mr. GOLDBF.RG. I received my college education in a junior college'in the city of Chicago which is a public institution. This was calledCrane Junior College. It is a city college of the city of Chicago.And I attended that college from 1924 until 1926.I also moonlighted. In addition to my attendance at the juniorcollege, I took an additional course so I could get into law school withthe proper credits at DePaul University, a university located inChicago.My degrees from Northwestern University Law School are B.S.L.,bachelor of science in law, instead of B.S., and then I received a jurisdoctor degree.When I was inducted into the Army I was not inducted as a major,I was inducted as a captain. I was promoted to the rank of ma or.So that in my Army career it should be listed as captain in the U.S. Army and then major.I was promoted to major. I never was promoted to colonel until Iwas put into the Reserves much later, recently.(The corrected biographical sketch of Mr. Goldberg is as follows:)ARTHUR J.

I do. 

Since I began to practice lawpvq~pM...NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGCHAIRMAN. I want you to take your time, you probably can't thiiU all of them off the cuff,Mr. GOLDBERG. Since I began to practice law in Chicago in 1929 I joined and became a member of the Chicago Bar Association, the Illinois Bar Association, the American Bar Association. I was a member of the National Lawyers Guild. I have been a member of many organizations identified with the Jewish faith, the American Jewish Congress. I th-ink I have been identified with the American JdewI ihshavCe opmrombiattbeley. belonged to other groups, the names of which Ido not recall. 

I will be glad to furnish that, 

I would be delighted, Mir. Chairman, if you would like me to file a list of all the organizations.The CHAimRwN. That is what I want. Mr. GOLDBERG. I have been a member of the American Civil Liberties Union in Chicago, I have been a member of the Independent Voters of Illinois-these are the principal organizations-I am a member of the Democratic Party and have been for many years. 

I think in my own capacity I am a member of 56 committees for the President, or thereabouts-this is probabl an exaggeration of the many committees of the President. I shall be glad to file as complete a list as I can. The CIIAIRMAN. Senator Kefauver. 

There is no more difficult task, because a person like myself who has led an active life and who has expressed himself on many subjects, who has had deep feelings about those subjects, which he still has--I am not a different person from the person that I have been in my prior appearances before the Congress-nevertheless, if I am approved by the Senate, when I take office as a Justice I would regard my first task and the primary task of being a Justice of the Supreme Court to be on guard, as Justice Brandeis said, lest my prejudices, my convictions, my predilections, are erected into legal principles.My obligation will be, if I am confirmed, and when I am confirmed, to enforce, as the Congress does in its own right and in its own way, and as the President does in his own way and in his own right, to enforce and apply the Constitution of the United States. That is a different obligation, much more serious obligation than the one that a private citizen has when he expresses himself on many problems.

No, this is a very difficult thing, because we are human beings who are a product of our environment, our experience. But I know no higher obligation of a judge than to guard himself against, his own predilections and to try to decide cases on the basis of the law and the facts.NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG

Under the Constitution of the United States, we have a separation of powers. Under article 1, section I, of the Constitution all legislative powers are vested in the Congress. This I hope and I intend, if I am a Justice, to respect. This is the secret of our great democracy. The executive power under article 2 is vested in the President. Under article 3, the judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court and such inferior courts as the Congress of the United States shall establish. It would be my intent, my philosophic conviction, that we must pay due respect to the Constitution. This is what a SupremeCourt Justice is called upon to apply in the cases before him. And I would hope within human fallability to observe the greatprinciple written into the Constitution by the Founding Fathers of our great Republic.

Senator McClellan, you and I have worked together in this area, I think, in the past, as you commented earlier. But I was functioning, of course, as either a private citizen or a memberof the executive branch of the Government. I would like to say this. There are several cases I have seen onthe docket of the Sur "eme Court involving this question. If I am confirmed by the Senate, I would hope to participate in these cases. I would not like any remark of mine to lead any litigant to believe that I am prejudiced for or against any particular form of view.Senator McCLELLAN. Mr. Secretary, may I interrupt? Of course, we all know that cases have different factors involved; they are notall identical. But this is covering a general principle. Mr. GOLDBERG. But I would have no hesitancy in saying, with dueregard for the merits of any particular case, and without expressing an opinion upon any particular case that I have found, in my experience, that the Congress, in exercising its necessary role in conducting investigations appropriate to legislation, has exercised a very salutary and important function in the operation of our democracy.NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGI sit next to a Senator, on my left, whose investigations into the abuses in welfare funds on the part of employers and some smallminority of unions resulted in a fine piece of legislation which I, as Secretary of Labor, have had the opportunity to administer.I answer a question of a Senator who conducted investigations which led to legislation of great importance to safeguarding the benefits and rights of people who have joined unions. I respect the necessary rule of Congress in this area, and I see no dichotomy in this and thefunctions of the Court. Senator M[CCLELLAN. Mr. Secretary, I believe you have observed, andknow as I have, that these three areas in which I have interrogatedyou are areas in which possibly our Supreme Court has been more frequently criticized for its ruling. Without trying to argue either the merits or lack of merits in any such criticism I think it is significant, that this committee and the Senate should take cognizance of such criticism, and should undertake to make a record at the time of a nominee's consideration for confirmation, particularly as to his general viewpoint in these areas, and try to ascertain, insofar as they can, whether his confirmation and his service on the Court might tend to serve to further implement the conditions which have brought about such criticism.And again we can't go into any specific case; I know that; I amnot trying to do that. But I can say, and I think without any reservations or qualifications, thai a lot of good Americans todayare concerned about the trend of some Supreme Court decisions. And I share that concern. And I am hoping that there will bemore profound deliberation in some of these areas in the future, and that possibly, if it is in the interest of our country, that is what we should all desire, if it is in the interest of our country that there besome change, that that change will occur. I wish to thank you for your courtesy in answering. 

Senator, I would like to m,9ke two contents about this. I have read the same comments that you have in many of the articles. And first I would like to say this:The impression, perhaps, has arisen naturally from those who have observed my career most recently, that I am a specialized lawyer, I have represented labor organizations-for which I have no apology; they are fine organizations, the AFL-CIO, the SteelworkersUnion, the Textile Workers Union, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and many others.But I would like to say that before I did this-and this is in the most recent part of my career-I also represented many employers, I represented many lawyers, I think, going back 33 years-which I am reluctant to admit to, but which the record shows

YqU are entirely correct. My practice from 1929on ranged SenatoroHvReurStKheA.whNoOlWe ,pathneonpleyxot fqlauwet.ionofgeneralnatureisthis.And this again was raised in many'pf t he letters. You have answeredit in part. Many of the letters I have received have said, well, now, here is aman who has represented a single client-and to al! appearances, in fact, has represented them well and effectively. First of all I. would like to ask what your position is and what your relationship waswith the Steelworkers Union ? Mr. GOLDBER . Senator Hruska, my relationship with the Steel-workers Union dates back many,years. In 1937 or 1938, I don't recall the exact date, I was asked to represent this union as a lawyer in Chicago, when they were first attempting to get established. I repre-sentedthem as fheir counsel in Chicago, and in fact throughout theMidwest, reaching out to the FarWest._xOW=AT1OX "~ &RTHUR~J ~L~G1isSome years later, I wasaasked by Mr. Murray, thedeceec1 pro4dmtof that union, and the deceased president of the C10, .tobecq0ne theirgeneral counsel. That was in -1948. I becainme Ileir general uns0. Represented that union until I was nominated by the President to beSecretary of Labor. I resigned that post in Jainuary of, 1961, priorto my confirmation by the Senate.Since then I have had no Professional -relationship with, he Steel-workers Union. When I ed as general counsel for that union, Idid not become an employee of that union. , Part of the conditionsunder which I, accepted that designation was that I would be able toact for them aws law er,yerw ith independence, and as alawyer who represent them iniSenator Hu8KA. So.ye re not an officer, h union; you werea professional man in true sense of-the wordIMr. GOLDBERo. at is correct, sir.

I made two visions at the time harerrevoc-able decisions, nd which, gardl owhto'th" hearingmor regardless o what -ha p -'onfirmation as S rotary ofLabor, are firm, i evocab e decisions. The Steelwork Union, be-cause they felt,righ or wrongly, that I had served m well duringall these years, by actio f their governing bodpentesdionplan as part of my retAiner,was antial peIan.renounced that when I was nominal to the office oftary ofLabor.I do not feel that I could function as a representative of the Govern-ment and of the people and still have an association, even though itwas vested--even though it could not be affected by anything I did-and still receive benefits in future years which might. originate fromthat union.I have no regrets about that, because I felt the public was entitledto an assurance that a Secretary of Labor serving all of the interestsof the people of:the country, management, and labor alike, would notbe affected by having an association, even of thfit type, with a clientthat he had represented.It goes without saying that that renuriciatioiiis a definitive renunci :-tion which persists in this particular post.And then, secondly, I announced at the time--and, of course, if I amconfirmed here, it is obviously true-that under any circumstances,NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. 0OWB5R0whether I an ,otfirmed or not confirmed, that I do not and did not expect to resume any association, not only with that union, but any unon if I were to go back in the practice of law as an ex-Secretary of Labor. I would go back into general practice and not the labor practice, and certainly not the practice of representing the Steelworkers Unio.I did that, Senator Hruska, for a very simple reason, not because this is wrong-ud I don't atempt to lay down this as a principle that anybody else ought to follow-but the public i entitled to feel, it is not only the subst dance but the appearance that is important-the public itsreaesnutirtilnegd atno afesesloctihataiot nananodffgicoiainl go, finthteheUf.Su.turGeo, vteotncnaiepnitlisise naont association which might lead him into any activity when he is functioning for the Government that might prejudice he position, in the public eye, of the Government.That is the fixed position with me, and that till exists. 

I agree with that thoroughly.

I am aware of this, and I would like to make a comment about it. And that is this. The Supreme Court is a body of men whom I am sure devotedly are trying to do their part in our constitutional system. They are not immune from criticism. They are not always right. They may be right or wrong, because human beings are fallible. In trying to apply the Constitution and laws of theUnited States there are many problems involved. Our Constitution was built, as Chief Justice Marshall said, to endure for the ages. And it is a remarkable thing that has endured for the ages.I think historically, if I am correct, that we have a Constitution, the only written Constitution which has survived for as long as our Constitution has survived. Many people think we are a young nation. But we are no longer the youngest nation in the world. I think we are theoldest nation that has survived under a written Constitution. It is a testimonial to our country that the Founding Fathers wrotea document that could endure for the ages. Now, you can't always be right, you can only do your best in anyoffice you occupy in the Government, whether you are a President, a member of the legislature, or a member of the Supreme Court. But one thing that is very important, to"me at least, is that there be freedom on the part of every element of society, the press, lawyers, citizens, the Congress, or anybody, to criticize anything that anybody does.i~1NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGIf we didn't have freedom, unlike what other countries do, where there is a closed society, if we did not have the freedom of an open society, then I would be more concerned about, our survival than I am. I think our great strength as a country is that we have a free country and people can express themselves freely.And we all learn from criticism, at least I hope I do. 

Because they knew about the British experience where there was no written constitution, and they wanted to profit by the benefits but also avoid the disabilities of an unwritten constitution. And when they wrote the Constitution they wrote it as a written document for several purposes. One was, they wanted to provide stability in our institutions. They did not want it to be a government which was so fluid that basic rights were not protected, the rights of life, liberty and property which we talked about in the Declaration of Independence. And also they were aware of the fact that we drew our origins from very proud and independent states. We grew from the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation into a written Constitution. And they wrote a written Constitution because they wanted to reserve to the States and to the people basic powers. And they wanted to delegate to the Federal Government certain rights, but they did not want to relinquish in this delegation the rights that were reserved to the people and the States. And they chose a Federal system, unlike Great Britain and other systems, because our origin was different, and this Federal Constitution was to be a Constitution which delegated powers and limited powers at the same time. And it would be a mistake for anybody to overlook these origins, because the history shows that-I don't think our Constitution could have been ratified if we didn't have the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights protected individuals, minorities and in article X, the States. So that we have a different origin, a different historical experience, a different background, which I am sure every.student of American history must respect. 

That is correct, sir. Senator Envi. And the second purpose was that which is expressed, Ithink in the most eloquent words probably in any of our opinions; where the Court said in'substance that they wrote a written Constitution which was to be a rule to govern both the Government and tle people, and the reason they did it, that they recognized in troubklsome times the Government and the people would be temptedNOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGto take sharp and decisive measures which they believed to be good, and that they thought were wise to restrain them by placing upon them irrefutable laws.Mr. GOLDBERG. I agree with that entirely. 

I agree with that entirely. 

One of the great things about the draftsmen of our Constitution is that they drafted a document that, as I said earlier, in the language of Chief Justice Marshall, that was to endure for the ages. No justice of the Supreme Court, in my opinion, should overlook the fact that his primary obligation is to interpret and app1 the Constitution and the amendments the way they were draite. This does not mean-and I am sure you would agree with me--that modern conditions should not be taken into account. One of the yery perceptive aspects of the great men who wrote this Constitution is that they drafted the Constitution in terms where, years later, decades later, centuries later, it can still be applied to modern times. So they drafted it in broad terms so that new conditions could be taken into account. I am sure they could not perceive--maybe Jules Verne could perceive-that we would be in the space age. But yet they drafted the Constitution so that the interstate commerce clause, the power to regulate commerce, was broad enough so that in keeping with their meaning-and their meaning is very apparent from the debates that took place at the Constitutional Convention-we could have a Federal Government in that age as well as reserve to the States those great powers that existed. So that while it is difficult for a judge in any given case to ,rrive at a decision, what is not difficult is the fact that we have a Constitution wisely conceived broadly drafted, that can apply the meaning of the men who drafted it and take into account modern conditions. 

That is correct, sir. 

1 think so. I don't think there is any need to changethe inter pretation that the Founding Fathers put on the Constitution,because I think these men were farsighted enough to realize that they were writing a document for, not the moment but for the distant future.And they wrote it in terms that permitted the aduptation of their language to moderate conditions. We are not deaf.ng with a dae.ument which is an obsolete document, nor are we dealing with intentions by the writers of that document that we have to repudiate it. I ,vould regard it to be a violation of the oath that a Justice takes to repudiate the intentions of the men who drafted the Constitution.'Vhile reasonable men may differ, and they do, about interpretation, the fact of the matter is that if you read the Feeralist papers, the constitutional debates, you will realize that you are dealing with really an extraordinary group of men, because they wrote a document unprece-dented in the history, I think, of civilization, that would endure for their time and for times to come.I would regard it as my function, for example, as a Justice, not to write my own view of what they did, but to write their view of whatthey didin the light of the fact that they wrote a document not only for their times but for all times.

Not entirely. 

I don't either.

I agree. They didn't write general language, even when they wrote it in broad terms, that was susceptible to interpretation that anybody could interpret in any way. They wrote that language in the light of many problems which the Colonies faced when they were Colonies subject to British jurisdiction. And I think when you read the Constitution you must read the Declaration of Independence, of course, where they stated their grievances which gave rise to the writing of the Constitution.I think you would be derelict in your duty if you construed the Constitution to be such a broad document that anything is permitted. I do not read it that way. There are many things that are very specific in the Constitution. And whether one's views of social and economic policy coincide with those views is irrelevant. When the Constitution was written they talked about those views, and I think any judge worth his salt has to subscribe to them.89276-62---3NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGThey also recognized that times will change. If you read the Fed-eralist Papers and the debate in the Constitutional Convention, youwill see that you had a group of extraordinary men who looked intothe future, and they recognized that times would change, they wrotelanguage that permitted the application of their principles to thechanging times.Take, for example, the interstate commerce clause. This is a greatsource of Federal jurisdiction which the Congress is applying everyday. I do not find the Congress acting in modern times contrary to theintention of the Founding Fathers.The critical debate which took place at the Constitutional Conven-tion was the fact that the interstate commerce clause was a clause of-theConstitution. And it is not a derogation of the Constitution whenthe Federal Congress enacts under that great charter of power appro*-*priate legislation.,There are many specific prohibitions against legislation. Thereare broad grants of authority which Congress, not the Court, has theright to exercise. My view is that we are the beneficiaries of one of.the great written documents of all times, and it is a great document,-and that it is a great obligation to construe that document.. That document preserves basic rights which cannot be derogated. _it4 preserves a basic Federal-State structure which must be preservedin the light of history. And it permits progress, but at the same timeprotects tradition.This is the way I view the Constitution.'

No; I do not. I said the other day, and I want to repeat, that a judge is a human being, and all humans are fallible. But 1 would regard the first function of a judge, whether he sits in a trial court or an appellate court or in our highest tribunal, to make sure as much as any human being can that he puts aside his own prejudices predilections, viewpoints, prejudices-which we all possess-and knowing that he possesses temm, to try to administer justice equally under the law.We cannot exalt our prejudice into law. If we did that we ought not to serve as a judge. If there is any feeling on this committee that I as an individual am the type of person who could not recognize my own limitations, put that aside, and when I decide a case on the Supreme Court, try to be as objective as any luman being can, then I would say to you, you ought to reject my appointment.And I would not want to serve under those circumstances. 

I do. And I agree Where Justice Brandeis, if T may quote him again, said something that I think is verysignificant.. This question you asked, Judge Ervin,- also relates to the question of how do we apply precedent in law. I have thought about that a great deal. And Justice Brandeis once said in an opinion that for most questions-not all, because I think you faced that probl6ni when you were sitting on the Supreme Court of your State-for most questions it is more important that a question be decided finally, very often, than decided rightly

I feel that very strongly, because you can't have a rule of law which changes day by day.On the other hand, I am sure you would agree from your own experience, there comes a time when there is a question, probably not related to the ordinary affairs of men-for example, I would think of property law where people have bought 'rc.perty and sold property, it would be very bad to change the rule because you disagreed with the rule.I would think as a Justice my inclination would be-and I can't say, because I am not a Justice, but I speak from this point nowI would say under those circumstances that even if I disagree I would say, where people have relied upon opinions, that they oughtNOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGto-that it would be a very bad rule to change a rule because of a personal viewpoint of a Justice that the rule is a bad rule and we ought to change it, because you could not have any stability in your structure if you did it.On the other hand, I am sure you would agree with me that where there is a fundamental question of human rights, that sometimes you would have to analyze that and say, maybe the Court was wrong.But that ought to happen rarely, not frequently, because if we live under a rule of law and not of men, rules of law ought to prevail. And a Justice ought to be properly respectful of great traditions, and apply that great tradition even where his personal viewpoint might be that the great tradition is not a correct tradition.

I would say that that is a very salutary rule, and that the only point of departure from it is what you experienced as a judge, which I may experience if I am confirmed, and that is when you come to the profound conviction that there is such a fundamental error that it must be redressed.Beyond that, the rule of stare decisis ought to apply, because otherwise we don't have a government of law, we have a government which varies when individual men have differences of opinion. And I would say for myself that any lawyer who is steeped in the law and who has reverence for tradition ought to say to himself that there must be continuity in law, otherwise people cannot guide themselves on what a rule of law is, and that you change only when you are fundamentally convinced that there has been such a grievous error in decision that the original purpose of a provision of law, of congressional enactment, or of the Constitution was not observed.And then of course you would not be faithful to your oath if you did not change your mind. But that ought to be the rare exception, not the usual rule.

It has no other power, it is under our constitutional system a power to interpret and apply the Constitution of the United States.

The Supreme Court of the United States is a great, august body. It is not a constitutional convention. There is an atricle in the Constitution which states the method by which the Constitution ought to be amended, and that is by act of Congress and by act of the States. That is the provision which ought to be applied to amend the Constitution.The Supreme Court is not, the body to amend the Constitution, it is to do its best to apply and interpret the Constitution.

That is correct. Senator Envix. Just one more question-maybe more than one, but I am about finished. George Washington, in his farewell address to the American people, pointed out in substance how we had divided the powers of governmnent in the interest of forbidding one branch of the government from encroaching upon the domain of the others. Andi he made the statement that to preserve things, that is, the division of powers, must be as necessary as to institute them. And he says this-If, in the opinions of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates-but let there be no change by usurpation, for though this. in one sense, may be the instrument of good, it isthe customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.Do you agree with that? Mr. GOLDBERG. Entirely. 

The Supreme Court. of the United States is one coordinate agency of our Government. It is not the sole repository of the obligation to enforce the Constitution of the United States. The P resident has a great obligation. ie is bound by his oath of office and the Constitution to enforce the Constitution. The Congress, under its article of the Constitution, article I, has a coordinate responsibility to enforce the Constitution of the United States. Therefore each must be respectful of the other. If the Court derogated tu itself powers reserved to the Congress under article I, or to theNOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGExecutive under article II, our democracy would be in great danger. I know of no greater function of the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates than to exercise the necessary restraint to confine itself to its functions, recognizing that it is not the only body, under our Constitution, which responsibility for enforcing andi applying the Constitution of the United States. . The court performs a limited function. Every day, here in Congress, there is exercise of great constitutional authority, and every day in the 'White House there is exercise of great constitutional authority. Each must exercise the restraint that the Constitution imposes upon each.And one of the virtues of our system is that through stress and strain we have succeeded in accommodating these coordinated branches. It is a terrific responsibility, of which I am very well aware.

Very much so. 

I agree with that, witb the reservation that I expressed to you earlier, that if there is a finding that an established doctrine violated the original intention and ran contrary to it, that then any judge worth his salt would acknowledge mistake and error. But like I quoted Brandeis before, in most instances you have to follow precedent because we must have settled doctrine, we can't change it with every wisp of the wind.But the primary obligation of any judge who is respectful of tradition is to observe tradition unless there is such clear and unmistakable error-error in the judge, not in the original purpose of the Constitution, because that is not an error, any judge worth his salt would say that he adheres to the original view-but if there has been an error in interpretation, of course the judge must acknowledge that. But beyond that, I agree with what you have said.

Senator, I have been at the bar of the State of Illinois and the District of Columbia and the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates for about 33 years. My record is an open record. I have never operated underground or behind the scenes. My activities as a lawyerand as a citizen are a matter of public record.,89276-62---4NOMINATION . OF ARTHUR J. GQLDBRRG -Everything I have done in my life I have done openly. I have not done anything secretly or in any way that is not subject to public scrutiny. Throughout my life I have been an activist. I hope now not to be such an activist, but I have been an activist, and I haveengaged in open activity. And my activities have been reported upon by the press of my hometown, Chicago, the national press, and they have been a matter of open comment.I have written about this subject, so that I have expressed myself directly upon these issues.I don't want to disqualify myself. There are some cases coining up in the Court which involve the legal rights of the Communist Party, and I do not want anything I have said or will say to militate against my right to sit in judgment. When you interpret the Constitution you interpret the Constitution in reference to the rights of anybody in our counry. We do not act like the Soviet Union or totalitarian countries act, by executive fiat.We act as a government of laws. And therefore what I am now going to say,Ihope, will not be construed by anybody to mean that I cannot objectively pass upon the constitutional rights of any group, including any Communist group.Having said that, I want to say this: Throughout my life, everywhere I have appeared, in any forum in which I have spoken, in any area in which I have been engaged-and I have been engaged in many forums and -many plat-formsand many areas-I regard and have regarded communism to be a dangerous international movement, incompatible with our democratic traditions. I have never deviated from that viewpoint from the earliest days of my life.I have never deviated from that in representing any group that I have represented.I have written upon this subject, it is an open public matter. I have written a book on the labor movement, "The A.F. of L.-CIO, LaborUnited "which is published by McGraw-Hill. I have a chapter in that book, chapter 10, devoted to communism and corruption. That book states my philosophy in this area. It is not a new philosophy, it is aphilosophy to which I have subscribed through my whole ife. I re-gard the Communist movement to be a perversion of what people have a right to expect from government and from life.It is completely contrary to our way of life. We believe in freedom and democracy, and the right of people to speak their convictions, and their right to live in a society where they can criticize you or me, where they can take issue with a President of the United States, or a Senator, or a Congressman, or a private citizen.These views are stated in this book, and I would like, with the permission of the chairman, to incorporate in the record the chapter ofthe book which deals with that subject. 

NOW, this is nothing new to me. When I came down here in 1948 to represent the CI, one of my first tasks was to represent the labor movement in what I regarded to be one of the most important functions of my life. And that was to inaugurate and initiate proceedings to rid the CIO, a great labor movement, of elements in its labor movement which were seeking to subvert our great free. labor movement for other purposes.I represented the CIO in that effort, of which I am very proud. And under my counselship the CIO, with due process, because we all believe in this, conducted trials of unions which fell under Communist domination. Those unions were, after a fair trial, and after a hearing which we accord in a democracy, expelled from the CIO.The reports which were written in those cases by the committees which tried these unions were written with my help. That has been publicly stated. I was the chief counsel, and I advised the'trial committees. I and my associates and my law firm assisted, drafted for the committees at their request, their reports.These reports are a public document now. They were offered and printed by the Senate as Document No. 89 in the 82d Congress. I would like to make a part of the record, Mr. Chairman, these reports.These reports reflect my considered view as the chic f counsel of the CIO about the nature of the Communist Party, about its attempts to infiltrate the trade union movement, about its attempts to deceive the American people as to it nature and objectives.And on the basis of these reports the free democratic trade union movement of the United States expelled these unions from the ('10.I subscribe to every word contained in these documents. And since I was largely responsible for writing these words, as I say, with the assistance of my colleagues and with the approval of the committees which wrote this, who approved this report, I would like to offer this for the record, Mr. Chairman.

It is a Senate document, and I would rely upon your judgment as to how it is included. 

Thank you very much.(Excerpts from the Senate document referred to above are as follows:)REPORT OF EXECUTIVE BOARD COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT MURRAY To.* INVESTIGATE CHARGES AGAINST THE UNITED OFFICE AND PROFESSIONAL WORKERSOF AMERICAIt Is not the purpose of this committee to pass on the theoretical political goals of the Community Party. But, from the evidence presented to the committee, onesimple conclusion can be drawn. Whatever may be the theoretical goals of the party, its program is based upon one fundamental objective-the support of the Soviet Union, the country in which the Communist Party first achieved its goal of dictatorship. This objective is never expressly stated to be the sole controlling factor in determining the party's program. To the (ontrary, becauseof its desire to speak as an American, rather than as a Soviet, agency and to maintain its position within the trade-union movement, the party presents its program as a program for American not for Russian labor. The policies which the party adopts are stated to be policies for the achievement of the goals of American labor-not for the advancement of the cause of the Soviet Union. But. over a period of years it Is clear that the goals of American labor, as stated'NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBBRGby the party, are always found to be those policies which will aid the Soviet Union. As the tactical position of the Soviet Union in the world has changed, the program of the American Communist Party "for American labor" has accommodated itself. And, when it seemed in tile interest of the Soviet Union for American labor to forsake its heritage and to adopt policies contradictory to the whole fabric of the labor movement, the Communist Party adopted suchpolicies.On the basis of this evidence the colmittee finds that the purpose of the Communist Party is to promote the interests of tie Soviet Ulnion. It finds that, although tile Community Party has claimed to champion unionism and organiza-tion it has always (lone so in order to carry on Communist work within tradeunions and in order to pervert their policies to the advantage of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party, the committee finds, does not believe in tradeunions. It believes In using trade-unions. And it believes in using them for the purposes of the Soviet Union.Of great significance is one single fact. Never in the history of the UOPWAhas any policy ever been adopted which in any way runs counter to the policies of the Communist Party or to the interests of the Soviet Union as those interests are reflected In the program of the Communist Party. If the Communist Party program had been a consistent one, this absence of conflict might not be significant. But, In view of the fact that in a period of 10 years the CommunistParty has taken almost every conceivable position on every issue of public importance in the United States, the absence qf any conflict between the positionof the party and the position of this union is of great significance. The constantparallel between the position of the Communist Party and the position of the UOPWA cannot possibly be explained as coincidence or as the simultaneous but Independent adoption of similar policies. The reason It cannot be so explained Is that the policies of the Communist Party, as we have stated, have undergone repeated violent shifts, shifts which are explainable, only on the basis of the party's subservience to the interests of the Soviet Union. And the policies of the UOPWA have, In each Instance exhibited the same fatal shift.So It is that this union, the UOPWA, by following the twists and turns, the zigs and zags, of thon Communist Party line has prevented itself from genuinel.v representing the interests of the white-collar workers of America. It has faileddismally to organize those workers and most of the few that it has organized have been driven away from It as the subserVience of the union to the Communist Party became more obvious. In the fiscal year of 1946-47, this union re-ported to the CIO an average dues-paying membership of approximately 45,000. But, as of November 1949, this membership has dropped to the pitiable figure of approximately 12,000.*******REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE; To INVESTIGATE CTIARGES AGAINST TIlE FOOD, TOBACCO,AGRICULTURAL, AND ALLIED WORKERS OF AMERICA****SThere can be no doubt about the violent clash between the constitutional ob-Jectives and pulicsC of the CIO and th jiuiri,,i ,L ptuLt-oube oi mhe t"1JIIIIMLISL Party. The CIO is dedicated to advancing the cause of liberty and the never-ending struggle for equality begun by our forefathers; to the end of achieving a world of free men and women. The CIO is further dedicated to organizing the unorganized, to making workers participants in the collective bargaining process, and to securing legislation insuring economic security and extension of civil liberties; l)rerequisites to a world of free men and women in a democracy. By command of the preamible to its constitution. the CIO is aligned against those who would use power to exploit the people for the benefit of alien loyalties.The Comnmunist Party is precisely the type of organization which the CIO Is under a constitutional mndate to oppose-one which would use power to exploit the people for the benefit of an alien loyalty. It matters not to the Communist Party whether a particular policy will advance or hinder the best interests ofAmerican labor. The sole test is whether the policy is required by the needsof the Soviet Union.

In event of conflict between theneeds of the Soviet Union and the best interests of American labor, the formermust always prevail.******The certificate of affiliation of the CIO is a symbol of trust, democracy,brotherhood, and loyalty in the never-ending struggle of the working men and women for a better life. There is no place in the CIO for an organization whose leaders pervert its certificate of affiliation into an instrument that would betraythe American workers into totalitarian bondage. The evidence is inescapable that by their disloyalty to the CIO, and their-dedication to the purposes and program of the Communist Party, the leadership of the FTA has rendered their union unworthy of and unqualified for their certifl'cate of affiliation with the CIO.REPORT OF EXECUTIVE BOARD COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT MURRAY ToINVESTIGATE CHARGES AGAINST THE NATIONAL UNION OF MARINE COOKS ANDSTE WARDS***,$***5. As has been seen, and as is common knowledge, the policies of the SovietUnion and of the United States began to diverge in numerous particulars shortlyafter the end of the war-a divergence which led gradually to the extremelystrained relations which now exist between the two countries. On each of adozen or more issues which have separated the United States and the SovietUnion, MCS has stood with the Soviet Union and the Communist Party againstthe United States. Never has MCS criticized the Soviet Union or taken aposition at variance with the position of the Communist Party. Never has MCSsided with the United States against Russia.*****SIll. MO8' deenseMCS'defense to the charges against it consisted in part of a series of evasions. MCS' representatives at the hearing attacked the charging party, the witnesses, the committee, the hearing. They asserted that the charges were illegal and unfair, that the committee was illegal and unfair, et cetera. This "defense", like MCS'other policies over a period of years, was of Communist origin-it was taken straight from the Daily Worker. In December 1949 that publication carried a series of articles by John Williamson, labor secretary of the Communist Party, on the attitude which the unions charged with subservience to communism ought to take toward the pending hearings. In their "defense" Messrs. Bryson and Tangen carefully followed Williamson's suggestions, and even his language. As the Daily Worker articles had suggested, MCS asserted that its independence was being violated, and that it was being denied the autonomous status guaranteed to it when it went into the CIO. MCS followed the Daily Worker's suggestion that it emphasize its trade-union artivities as an answer to the charges.REPORT OF EXECUTIVE BOARD COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT MURRAY To INVESTIGATE CHARGES AGAINST THE AMERICAN COMrMUNICATIONs ASSOCIATIONThe Communist Party's single-minded devotion to Russia controls its position on domestic issues, as well as on matters of foreign policy. A peculiar and consistent characteristic of the Communist Party program is that it always finds a tie-in between domestic and foreign policy. Thus, during the collectivesecurity period when the Communists supported the Roosevelt foreign policy, they also supported his domestic policy as progressive and prolabor. In the next period, however, when the German-Russian Pact was in effect, Roosevelt was seen by the Communist Party as a reactionary and a Fascist and his domesticprogram was roundly attacked as being antilabor. The most blatant example of the controlling influence of Russian foreign l)licy on the domestic policies of the American Communist Party was, perhaps, the Tehran period, when the fact that Stalin and Roosevelt had met and agreed was regarded as proof that an era of peace between capital and labor within the United States wasNOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGassured. But almost equally blatant was the Communist position with regard to President Truman's domestic policy in the postwar period. The Presidentwas charged with a sell-out of labor and a betrayal of the fight for civil liberties,The Fair Deal was denounced as a sham. The administration was, in short, atool of the reactionary capitalists and its domestic program and its foreignprogram were both products of the "bipartisan reactionary coalition." Similarly,attacks on the administration's foreign policy were tied in, however illogically, with attacks on Republican domestic policy. Thus, the Marshall plan (whichhad been opposed by Senator Taft and the most reactionary Republicans) was, in the Communist view, simply the application of the Taft-Hartley Act to foreignaffairs.*******IvThe Committee has examined the publications of the ACA, the reports of its officers to its conventions and its convention proceedings, and the positionstaken by ACA representatives at CIO conventions and executive board meetings. From these materials the committee has ascertained the policies which have from time to time been followed by ACA. The committee has compared thesepolicies with the program of the Communist Party of the United States. Fromthis examination the committee finds that the policies and activities of the ACAhave followed and continue to follow exactly, without deviation, the program of the Communist Party.*******The Communist line to which ACA has publicly adhered has likewise determined the positions which Selly has taken as the ACA representative on thisexecutive board. Selly opposed the 1947 resolutions censuring Communist pene-tration of the Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. He opposed CIO's position In the 1948 elections, and announced that he would have opposed CIO support of the Marshall plan had he been present when the resolution of support was adopted. Selly opposed the expulsion from the CIO of the New York City Industrial Union Council for its subservience to the dictates of the CommunistParty. Ie likewise opposed the withdrawal of CIO from the WFTU.The committee has examined the material which ACA submitted to "prove" this preposterous claim. It finds that this charge is wholly false and completely unsupported by the evidence.The ACA has charged, in substance: 1. That CI0 opposed nazism and fascism in 1938. 2. The CIO opposed war in the 1939-41 period. 3. That CIO urged tihe defeat of nazismn and fascism in the fall of 1941. 4. That CIO sponsored a "bring the boys home" campaign in 1945. 5. That CIO repeatedly in the past has deplored Red-baiting. The committee has examined the record of the CIO and compared it with the record of the Communist Party and of ACA, and finds as follows: 1. The CIO opposed Nazi and Fascist aggression In 1938, as did President Roosevelt and the entire liberal movement in the United States. The Communist Party and ACA also opposed Nazi and Fascist aggression during thisperiod. 2. After the German-Russian pact was signed and war in Europe began, theCIO opposed direct involvement in the war, as did President Roosevelt. The CIO continued to support Roosevelt's program of aid short of war to those fighting Hitler, and it supported the defense program. The CIO in fact proposedseveral plans (tile Murray and Reuther plans) to increase production for aid to the Allies and for national defense, and its representatives participated in the National Defense Advisory Commission and the National Defense Mediation Board. The Communist Party and ACA, on the other hand, opposed aid to the Allies, declared that the war was being fought for nothing but profit, opposed the national defense program, and asserted that the administration was trying to drag this country into the war.3. The CIO, consistently with its entire prior position, continued to urge the defeat of nazism and fascism in the fall of 1941. The Communist Party and ACA, inconsistently with their immediately prior position and consistently only with the interests of Russia, urged the defeat of Germany only after HitlerInvaded Russia.S927--Q2-5NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG4. The CIO, In 1945, urged that all surplus troops be brought home. It did not, like ACA and the Communist Party, couple this demand with criticism of American policy vis-a-vis China.5. The CIO has frequently In the past and still today does denounce those who would use the cry of "Communist" to destroy honest American trade unions. But, at the same time, it has also frequently announced its rejection of communism and "any movement or activity of subversive character, Trojan horses, or fifth columns" (CIO executive board resolution of June 4, 1940). Its members "resent and reject efforts of the Communist Party * * * to interfere in the affairs of the CIO" (resolution adopted by CIO convention, November 18, 1946). ACA, on the other hand, has opposed "Red-baiting" not on the ground that false charges of communism are dangerous and should be opposed but rather on the apparent theory that all charges of communism, true or false,should be rejected.REPORT OF EXECUTIVE BOARD CoMMITTEE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT MURRAY ToINVESTIGATE CHARGES AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL FUR AND LEATHER WORKERSUNION'*******The members of the committee were of course aware that Ben Gold, the presi-dent of IFLWU, Is and has for many years been an avowed Communist. Theywere aware that Irving Potash, manager of the Furriers Joint Council of NewYork, is and for some years has been a high official of the Communist Party,and that he has recently been convicted, along with other party leaders, of conspiring to advocate the overthrow of the United States Government by force andviolence. These facts would not, however, If they stood alone, sustain the chargesagainst the IFLWU, since those charges are laid under article VI, section 10,of the CIO constitution and are based on the policies and activities of the union.It was therefore necessary for the committee to ascertain what policies andactivities the IFLWU has followed and is following, and whether those policiesand activities are directed toward achieving the program or the purposes of theCommunist Party rather than the objectives set forth in the constitution of theCIO.The committee has thenfore examined the publications of the IFLWU, in-cluding its convention proceedings, and the positions taken by the IFIAVU rep-resentative on the CIO executive Board. From these materials the committeehas ascertained the policies and activities which have been and are being pur-sued by the IFLWU. The committee has compared these policies and activitieswith the program of the Communist Party of the United States. The committeefinds that the policies and activities of the IFLWU have been and are todaydirected toward the achievement of the program and purposes of the CommunistParty.*******The charge against the IFLWU is not that it has differed with CIO policy. Unions affiliated with 3IO have a right to differ with CIO policies if they honestly believe that the policies which they advocate will achieve the objectives of American industrial unionism set forth in the CIO constitution. The charge against the IFLWU is that it has not adopted its policies on the basis of any honest judgment as to how to achieve those objectives, but has simply taken its policies from the Communist Party.The basic question posed by the charge against IFLWU is whether it is an honest trade-union, genuinely devoted to the advancement of the cause of American labor and American democracy, or a union whose policies and activities are determined by the Communist Party. To this question there can, In the light of the evidence, be only one answer: The IFLWU has for years followed the tortuous paths of the Communist Party. Over the years it has been iuterventionist, isolationist, interventionist, and then isolationist again. It has been pro-Roosevelt, then anti-Roosevelt, then pro-Roosevelt again. The IFLWU's occupancy of these contradictory positions has invariably coincided with the Communist Party's tenure of them, and can only have resulted from the IFLWU's subservience to the wishes of the Communist Party and the SovietNOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGUnion. Indeed, the IFLWU's pi-blications are rife with Marxist and Stalinist doctrine, and with Soviet propaganda.REPORT OF EXECUTIVE BOARD COMMITTEE APPOINTED DY PRESIDENT MURRAY To INVESTIGATE CHARGES AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL LONG'HOREMEN'S ANDWAREHOUSEMEN'S UNION***SSSStcCtttaiiihocooooenhMnnnmti.arenoomalverfveivAuonoeiennbngnvridjdeeeseaerntc,tpdaPthweiintevnanhodregrderetslerytdense.catntarnoidnumsfdTgfethbgnropmeeeoloeebCulnrienocofmIroOdisoeed,remsnorifmesuooaqbirifdnnunteadaetdnathlhiwibettceahyooafeumtCfCebitIldfeeIiOuntaOghn.tute,eodannawoTvadmrbhihdoyoeevitlnsnhaeoeCtnenauacItplrOnpioncyrolfgloiiaobcsgsorjitreheethdahcsfemetaebidortvechivteacowevsuarrroetsseoeelap;dunfunpotrttetoftphoahroeirletooiyshbedroecegsraoroagstenonfaysnfisnoztdticaiiiztmtinnhaauodgee--fthe unorganized, to making workers participants in the collective-bargaining process, and to securing legislation insuring economic security and the extension. of civil liberties.*****SFINDINGSThe testimony, both oral and documentary, at the hearing demonstrates incontrovertibly, and the committee finds, that the policies and activities of the International Longshoremen's ard Warehousemen's Union, under the leadership of its international officers and executive boart, have long been and are today directed toward the achievement of the program and the policies of the Communist Party rather than the objectives set forth in the constitution of the CIO.The ILWU has consisently and without a single deviation followed the sharp turns and swerves of the Communist Party line and has sacrificed the economic and social interests of its membership to that line. The defense presented by Harry Bridges and his fellow officers was an evasion of the real i:sue involved in the trial: they objected on hypertechnical grounds to the introduction of all relevant evidence; introduced extraneous and irrelevant evidence; made unsupported and slanderous attacks upon the witnesses; and generally evidenced a hysterically evasive attitude toward the charges and toward the trial committee.*******REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE CHARGES AGAINST THE INTERNATIONALUNION OF MINE, MILL, A.ND SMELTER WORKERS*******One need not look very far to see the reason for such slavish adherence to the ideology of a foreign country. The Communist Party in America Is part of the worldwide Communist movement which seeks to organize workers into unions in various countries to spearhead a revolution for the establishment of a proletarian dictatorship. The first such dictatorship was established in Russia and the entire movement is primarily dedicated to protecting and preserving this dictatorship. Hence whenever the policies of the Soviet Union change, the American Communist Party must do a flip-flop no matter how irrational the change may be in terms of the true interests of American workers. * * *The false cry of freedom to criticize cannot justify the Communist tactic of systematic assassination against the national CIO, its officers and all affiliated unions who oppose the policies of the Communist Party.*******REPORT ON EXECUTIVE BOARD COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT MURIRAY TO CONDUCT HEARINGS ON UNITED PUBLIo WORK IMS OF AMERICANOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGThe program of the Communist Party in the United States, from the time of the formation of the CIO to the present, can be divided Into six periods, each of them corresponding to a change in the relationship of the Soviet Union with the world.r11The new union, UPW, lost no time in declaring its stand. Resolution No. 1 of the convention in which the SCMWA-UFWA merger was consummated readsas follows:"Whereas the unity of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United Stateswas the foundation for military defeat of fascism, and their continuing unityis absolutely essential if the United Nations is to provide a sound and lastingpeace; and"Whereas the friendship and cooperation between the United States and theSoviet Union is the essential basis for an enduring peace; and"Whereas powerful Influences are attempting to drive a wedge between thepeoples of the United Nations for the purpose of furthering their imperialistambitions, as evidenced by ex-Prime Minister Churchill's speech; the formingof Anglo-American bloc within the U.N. and the policy of assisting by armed force in some cases the most reactionary groups in friendly countries such asChina, the Philippines, France, Belgium, and others; and"Whereas to further these policies the demobilization of American troops nowsta"tWiohneerdeatshrtohuegfhaoiulutrethetoweosrtladbliisshbeiinntgerdnealtiiboenraalteclyoodpeelraaytieodn;and in thedevelopmentand control of atomic energy and the continued secrecy and manufacture ofatomic bombs have created world fear and distrust which weaken the peace:therefore be it"Rcgolvcd, That the UPWA, meeting in convention April 24-26, 1946, calls uponPresident Truman, Secretary of State Byrnes, and Members of Congress to takethe following immediate steps: "1. To halt the present policy of attempting to isolate the Soviet Union in theU.N. and world affairs and call for an immediate meeting of the minds of theBig Three."2. To take positive steps to reestablish friendly United States-Soviet relationsby word and deed."3. To withdraw American troops and call for the withdrawal of British troopsfrom all friendly countries, including China, the Philippines, France, Greece,India, Indonesia, Belgium, and Iceland."4. To support the policy of U.N. regulation and control of all phases ofatomic energy, including the immediate possession of all atomic bombs and thepassage by Congress of legislation vesting full control of atomic energy In acivilian commission."According to a story by Jerry Kluttz in the Washington Post, this resolutionwas adopted out of order, on a day when no resolutions were scheduled to beconsidered, at the suggestion of George Morris, a correspondent of the DailyWorker, so that the Daily Worker would have a story to offset the criticismdirected at Russian foreign policy at the Textile Workers' convention on thatday. According to Mr. Kluttz, opponents of the resolution were called reaction-aries and Red baiters and a suggestion by a delegate that a line be added to theresolution recommen(ling the withdrawal of Russian troops from Poland, Czecho-slovakia, Estonia, and other countries was shouted down.Other newspapers also reported that the foreign-policy resolution was theonly resolution adopted on that day of the convention. Moreover, the UPWrel)resentatIves, although they made several adverse references to Mr. Kluttz,did not deny the accuracy of the story. The committee, therefore, accepts itas true. The resolution speaks for itself. That it was taken out of order atthe behest of an agent of the Daily Worker seems to the committee to be entirelyconsistent with the pro-Comnmunist text of the resolution and with the history ofthe union leadership that sponsored it.In the period following the 1946 convention and continuing up to the presentmoment, the UPW has never repudiated the basic pro-Soviet position exhibitedat its first convention under its new name. Within the councils of the CIO ithas continued to support the program sponsored by the Communist Party. TheNOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGunion, however, did tone down the blatancy of its public position in order to protect its position as a union' of Government'workers. But it continued, by indirection and subtle phraseology, to serve the Communist Party's purposes even in its official public announcements.**S**SMr. GOLDBERG. So I say to you, Senator Wiley from the earliest part of my days as a private citizen, representing the labor movement as a lawyer, I never had any question or doubt on this subject. And the Communist Party of the United States, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the international branches, is a body entirely contrary to anything we believe in.It is inimical to the purposes of democracy, you cannot reconcile any concepts that they advocate with the concepts that we believe inas a free people. Senator I ILEY. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The question was asked-not that I had any question about it my.self, because I have read that report, and I know the situation, but I do think that in the interest of the public knowledge that should go out.You have made a presentation that ought to clearly convince anyone who is interested and not completely prejudiced that. you have never been a Communist and you are not sympathetic toward theirphilosophy.-Now, after listening to you and the judge over here talk about theConstitution, I just want to ask you a few questions.Of course, the Constitution isn't a fetish, you realize that. And itcame into being in the days when we were young and we didn't havethe economic society that we have now. I wanted to find out whetheryou agreed, however, with the fundamental thought of the divisionof power, executive, legislative, judicial residuum in the States, andthen again back in that connection, the function of the Court, thefunction of the Executive, and the function of the legislative branch,and the residuum that is in the States and the people.If you can do that very briefly, I would just like to see what yourideas are. Mr. GOLDBERG. I believe strongly in the doctrine of the separationof the powers. Under article I of the Constitution, the legislative power is reposed in the Congress of the United States. That is where the Constitution provided it ought to be, and that is where it should be under any conception of the type of government that we have.Under article II, the executive power is vested in the President, and that is where it ought to be. Under article III, the judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court and such inferior courts as the Congress may prescribe.I believe in separation of power. I do not believe that it is a function of the judiciary to legislate. I do not believe that it is the function of the executive to judge. I do not believe that it is the functionof the legislature to judge. I believe it is the function of judges to judge and not legislate.Now, this is not always easy, as we all know. But I would hope, asa jidge, if I am confirmed, to follow the great principles of our Constitution, which is separation of powers, checks and balances, and not to try as a judge to perform a function which by the Constitution is vested in another branch of the Government.NOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBERGSenator WiLFY. What is your idea about this economic system in America?Mr. GOLDBERG. That is a matter which judges should stay away from. That is a matter which ought to be decided in terms of legislative policy and which ought to be decided by legislation. But if you want to ask personally, I believe in the free enterprise system, I have said this many times, I believe we have realized more benefits under our system of private enterprise, capitalism, than any other country in the world.I believe our laboring people have benefited from this. They have achieved the highest standards of living of any group in the world. Today we have a per capita income in the United States of $2,400 per person per year. Let's contrast that with any other system. The President sent me to Africa to represent him at an Independence Day ceremony. I found that the per capita income of the people in this new republic-and they are struggling-was $50 a year. And that is a long way from what we have been able to achieve.We ought to count our blessings in this country. We have problems. And I have been before the Congress on what I regard to be unfinished business. I haven't changed my views about this, and sometimes Congress has disagreed with me, as is right, about these views.But there is no question in my mind that under our private, free enterprise system we have achieved a general state of well-being which is superior to the well-being of any other people in the world. And I was very happy to see the Gallup poll the other day which indicated that our people who work in the mines and the factories and the shops know this, they recognize this, and while they have their problemsand there are problems that are unfinished-I think our system has afforded the best protections, the best standards, the best state of conditions of any system in the world.I am proud of our system. 

When I became Secretary of Labor I said-I had aset of convictions, and I told the Senate Labor Committee that I had not brainwashed myself, and I still haven't. I have a set of views about the status of society which I have always had and which I still have. I did not regard those viewpoints to be'incompatible with business. And I am very proud, and I think the chairman will indicate, that in the letters that have been received by this committee are letters from many business groups, including the steel industry, with which I sat in negotiations; many of their leaders have sent letters to this committee supporting my nomination. The maritime industry, the aluminum industry, and many other industries have written very nico letters to the committee, and have asked that they be made a part of therecord.I think this is a little different from the complimentary letters, I am sur, that anyone receives who is nominated for high office.I am for our system of enterprise. I am for businessmen who must make profits in order to endure. I have said to many labor conventions what I am saying to you, that a laboring man cannot get good wagesNOMINATION OF ARTHUR J. GOLDBDRGunless his employer prospers, unless he makes good profits, becausethis is part of our system. The reason an American workingman enjoys the high standard ofliving he enjoys is because he is a participant in a system of enterprisewhere both parties have enjoyed the benefits of a system that permits both to benefit. This is my conviction, I have had it, I have expressed it in the past, and I express it to you.

That is correct. We are not-first of all, we do not believe in a class society. We reject that concept. And we reject it completely. And I believe in that entirely. In our country there is opportunity for everyone to surmount his origins. And that is the way it ought to be. You can come from an immigrant family or a family which came here many years ago, and you can aspire to any office in the land, from the Presidency to an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. And when we take office, if I can remember what my distinguished predecessor, Justice Frankfurter, said, we are neitherCatholic or Protestant, Jew or gentile, agnostic or believer; when we enter upon the office of judge or legislator we perform our functions under the Constitution.That is the way I believe. 

I agree entirely. The Supreme Court makes many decisions based upon acts of Congress, and if the Supreme Court has ruled and Congress believes that the decision is not compatible with its desires and intent. Congress has the obligation to enact new legislation and reverse it, and in many areas this is the indicated procedure. So I agree entirely. 

Quite the contrary. And I think it is the plain duty of Congress, in any situation where the Supremd Court has ruled and Congress has the power to act, if Congress does not agree to enact new legislation. This is one of the constitutional responsibilities of the Congress of the United States. 

I do entirely. I made a speech on this subject to the American Law Institute some time ago, in which I said what you have said, Senator Keating. No one is immune from criticism in our constitutional system. But we should have respect for law, that is basic to all of us. But that does not mean we have to say-we agree with any particular decision.Decisions may be changed by act of Congress within our constitutional system. 'And very often judges themselves will say that they have decided this case on'the basis of what they think Congroess meant. If Congress meFnt otherwise, Congress can change it. That is the wav it, ought to be under our system.

Thank you very much, Senator. 

And still am.
