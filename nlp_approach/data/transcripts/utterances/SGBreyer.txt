Yes, I do.TESTIMONY OF HON. STEPHEN G. BREYER, OF MASSACHUSETTS, TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

I would like to introduce, Senator, my wife Joanna, who, as Senator Kennedy said, worked at the Dana Farmer Cancer Institute in Cambridge City Hospital.

NOW, Michael, next to her, is a first-year student at Stanford, and he is going to lead a trek into the mountains of Wyoming this summer. 

Nell is a recent graduate of Yale, and she is going back up to New Haven this summer. She is teaching dance to children up there in a special program. 

Chloe, as you heard, has graduated from Harvard and she is down here with two young women, and the three of them are putting out a new magazine called Who Cares for public service. Now, she will give you many copies, if you want, and order blanks, probably. 

My brother-in-law, who is a lawyer, and, as you say, I guess he is extremely good on television. And my sister-inlaw, who has run a program called City Arts, which puts on public lectures and performances in San Francisco. 

Thank you. At the outset, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank this committee really for the serious attention that you all have paid to my nomination. I appreciate the members taking the time out of enormously busy schedules to meet with me personally. And I recognize that you and your staffs have really prepared thoroughly for these hearings, and you have read the books and articles and the opinions and these things I have written. It seems to me that is some kind of new form of cruel and unusual punishment, quite a few. Now, there are many, many other people I would like to thank today. I am obviously very much deeply grateful to Senator Kennedy, who has given me so much over the years. I have learned and continue to learn lessons of great value from him. I really want to thank very much Senator Kerry and Senator Boxer for having come and taken the time to come here, along with Senator Feinstein, for supporting my nomination. I am especially grateful to President Clinton for nominating me to a position that I said, and I do find humbling to think about. If I am confirmed, I will try to become a Justice whose work will justify the confidence that he and you have placed in me. Now, I would like to begin by telling you a little bit about myself—although you have heard quite a lot—maybe, though, a few of the experience that I think have had an important effect on my life, how I think, and what I am. I was born, as you heard, and I grew up in San Francisco. I attended public schools, Grant Grammar School and Lowell High School. My mother was from St. Paul, MN. Her parents were immigrants from East Prussia, which is now part of Poland. My mother was a very intelligent, very practical, public-spirited kind of person, and she, like many mothers, had an enormous influence on me. She was the one who made absolutely clear to me, in no uncertain terms, that whatever intellectual ability I might have means nothing and will not mean anything, unless I can work with other people and use whatever talents I have to help them. So, I joined the Boy Scouts, I did work as a delivery boy, I did dig ditches for the Pacific Gas & Electric Co., and I mixed salads up in the city's summer camp. It was nice, Camp Mather, because at that time you had policemen and firemen and lawyers and doctors and businessmen and their families, and they were all there together at the city camp for 2 weeks in the summer. It was great. My mother really did not want me to spend too much time with my books. And she was right. I mean my ideas about people do not come from libraries. My father was born in San Francisco. He worked as a lawyer and as an administrator in the San Francisco Public School System for 40 years. I have his watch, as you said, Senator. He was a very kind, very astute and very considerate man. He and San Francisco helped me develop something I would call a trust in, almost a love for the possibilities of a democracy. My father always took me. As a child, he would take me with him into the voting booth. I would pull down the lever, and he would always say, "We're exercising our prerogative." He would take me to candidates' nights. Our school used to go up to Sac-ramento to see the legislature in session. It was Youth in Government Day. There was Boys' State. All this led me to believe, not just that government can help people, but that government is the people. It is created through their active participation. And that is really why, despite the increased cynicism about basic government—and we have really seen vast improvement in the fairness of government—I still believe that, with trust and cooperation and participation, people can work through their government to improve their lives.In 1957, as you said, I served in the Army for a little while. I studied in England, I returned to Harvard Law School, and then I clerked for Justice Arthur Goldberg, who became a wonderful lifelong friend. After 2 years in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department, I went back to Harvard to teach and to Massachusetts to live. And for the last 27 years, I have been privileged to live in Cambridge and work in Boston.I loved teaching. I loved my students. But if I were to pick out one feature of the academic side of my life that really influenced me especially, I think it would be this: The opportunity to study law as a whole helped me understand that everything in the law is related to every other thing, and always, as Holmes pointed out, that whole law reflects not so much logic, as history and experience.Academic lawyers, practicing lawyers, government lawyers, and judges, in my opinion, have a special responsibility to try to understand how different parts of that seamless web of the law interact with each other, and how legal decisions will actually work in practice to affect people and to help them.Working here on this committee in the 1970's, I learned a great deal about Congress, about government and about political life. There were disagreements to resolve, but everyone shared the same ground rules—basic assumptions about democracy, freedom, fairness, and the need to help others. These vast areas of widely shared beliefs are what has shaped the law of America and the lives of all Americans.Since 1980, I have been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, and that is Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico, and Rhode Island. Because of my colleagues and the work itself, this job is a great honor, a great privilege, and it has been a great pleasure to have.I have tried to minimize what I think of as the less desirable aspects of the job, one that Justice Goldberg really felt strongly about—that judges can become isolated from the people whose lives their decisions affect. I have continued to teach and to participate in the community and in other activities, which are important in connecting me to the world outside the courtroom. I have been helped in this task by my wife and her work at Dana Farber and at Cambridge Hospital, which shows me and others some of the sadness in this world, as well as its hopes and its joys.I believe that the law must work for people. The vast array of Constitution, statutes, rules, regulations, practices and procedures, that huge vast web, has a single basic purpose. That purpose is to help the many different individuals who make up America—from so many different backgrounds and circumstances, with so manydifferent needs and hopes—its purpose is to help them live together productively, harmoniously, and in freedom.Keeping that ultimate purpose in mind helps guide a judge through the labyrinth of rules and regulations that the law too often becomes, to reach what is there at bottom, the very human goals that underlie Constitution and the statutes that Congress writes.I believe, too, in the importance of listening to other points of view. As a teacher, I discovered I could learn as much from students as from books. On the staff of this committee, it was easy to see how much Senators and staff alike learn from each other, from constituents, and from hearings. I think the system works that way. It works better than any other system. And our task is to keep trying to improve it.My law school diploma refers to law simply as those wise restraints that make men free—women, too, all of us. I believe that, too.I felt the particular importance of all this when 2 years ago, I had the good fortune to attend a meeting of 500 judges in the new Russia. Those judges wanted to know what words might they write in a constitution, what words would guarantee democracy and freedom. That is what they were asking over a 2-day meeting. They asked me. I mean they were interesting discussions, very interesting.My own reply was that words alone are not sufficient, that the words of our Constitution work because of the traditions of our people, because the vast majority of Americans believe in democracy. They try to be tolerant and fair to others, and to respect the liberty of each other, even those who are unpopular, because their protection is our protection, too.You are now considering my appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. That Court works within a grand tradition that has made meaningful, in practice, the guarantees of fairness and of freedom that the Constitution provides. Justice Blackmun has certainly served that tradition well. Indeed, so have all of those who have served in the recent past, Justice White, Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall. They leave an inspiring legacy that I have correctly called humbling to consider.I promise you, and I promise the American people, that if I am confirmed to be a member of the Supreme Court, I will try to be worthy of that great tradition. I will work hard. I will listen. I will try to interpret the law carefully, in accordance with its basic purposes.Above all, I will remember that the decisions I help to make will have an effect upon the lives of many, many Americans, and that fact means that I must do my absolute utmost to see that those decisions reflect both the letter and the spirit of a law that is meant to help them.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I might add one thing, if I might, on a slightly different subject. I want to add this, if I may, and that is recently I know—and this is important to me—that in recent weeks there have been questions raised about the ethical standard that I applied in sitting oncertain environmental cases in the first circuit at a time when I had an investment, an insurance investment in Lloyd's.I recognize that this question has been raised by people of good faith, and there is nothing more important to me than my integrity and my reputation for impartiality. It is obviously a most important thing to preserve public confidence and integrity in the judicial branch of government.I have reviewed those cases again and the judicial recusal statute, and I personally am confident that my sitting in those cases did not present any conflict of interest. Of course, my investment was disclosed to the public. There has been absolutely no suggestion that Lloyd's was involved as a named party in any of the cases on which I saw. I know of no such involvement.The judicial recusal statute does recusal, as well, if you have one case that has some kind of direct and predictable financial impact on some investment, that is to say if it is not a speculative or remote or contingent impact. The cases on which I sat did not violate this standard, either. That issue has been carefully looked into by independent ethics experts who share my view.Mr. Chairman, as I said, I recognize the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest or even the appearance of such conflicts, and that standard is essential for all judges, and especially essential for judges of the Nation's highest court.So I certainly promise I will do all I can to meet it, including what I shall immediately do, is ask the people who handle my investments to divest any holdings in insurance companies as soon as possible, and with respect to Lloyd's itself, I resigned in 1988. Though, because of one syndicate that remains open, I have been advised that I can leave altogether by the end of 1995, but I intend to ask the people involved to expedite my complete termination of any Lloyd's relationship. I will be out of that as soon as I possibly can be.Finally, as I go forward, I certainly will keep in mind the discussion that has arisen over the last few days, and I will take it into account in reviewing any possible conflict whatsoever.

That is fine, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. Chairman, I think usually, when I go back to basics, what I often try to do is I try to keep in my mind some kind of basic, two or three basic points in different areas which are sometimes helpful. The basic point or the basic case or the basic idea I have in my mind in this area is I go back to a case Justice Holmes decided. It is actually a very interesting case. A person owned a coal mine, and the Government said here is what you ought to do: Leave some columns of coal in that mine, because if you do not leave big thick columns of coal, the whole ceiling will collapse, and there are cities that are built on top of that coal mine and they are all going to fall down, and, therefore, we will have a regulation which tells you big thick coal columns. But the owner said I agree with you, I don't want anything to happen to anyone on the surface. But, really, you don't have to have columns that are that thick, you don't have to have that many, and what you have done is taken my coal. So the case presented the issue of when is it a reasonable regulation, for, after all, it is a good purpose to stop the cities from fallingIll into the mine. I mean that is a wonderful purpose. When does a reasonable regulation become a taking of property for which you must pay compensation? You know what Justice Holmes said. You are going to be disappointed, but what he said was this. He said, "You can regulate, you can regulate, you don't have to compensate, when you regulate. But, Government, you cannot go too far."What is too far? Indeed, ever since that time, the courts have been trying to work out what is too far, and I don't think anyone has gotten a perfect measure of that. They look into factors, they say how important is the regulation, what kind of reliance has there been on this, has there been a physical, a physical occupation of property.You see, in the case you have, which is very interesting, the one you mentioned, there might have been a physical taking of a piece of property, and then the Government can do less. But as I looked through these cases thereafter, you always come back to what is a kind of human judgment, what is too far. And the more reasonable what you are doing is, the less reliance there has been, the less it looks like it is taking something that historically has been considered a person's physical property, the more likely it is that you don't have to compensate.

NO, no, you are not off on that. Absolutely, the dissent you see in that absolutely thought that was so. The reason I hesitate a little bit is there is something special about that case, and what is I think a little special about the case is that it did at least arguably involve a physical occupation of a piece of property, and at the same time they didn't make all that much out of it. Then, as you just pointed out, they used this test of rough proportionality, and what exactly is that, it looks as if it is a little tougher.So where I end up in my mind is that this is an area that is not determined forever, that there are likely to be quite a few cases coming up, that this problem of how you work out when it goes too far is something that undoubtedly will come up again in the future, and there is a degree of flexibility and flux in these opinions that I think haven't made a definite decision forever. That is basically my state of mind on them at the moment.

Yes, it is. 

I think, Senator, that you would have very, very wide agreement with you across a very, very wide spectrum with what Holmes said, that the Constitution does not enact into law Herbert Spencer's social statics. What he meant by that is there is no particular theory of the economy that the Constitution enacts into law.That does not mean property has no protection. There is a takings clause in the Constitution. It does not mean that people's clothes and toothbrushes are somehow at stake and could be swept away randomly. What it means is that the Constitution, which is a document that basically wants to guarantee people rights, that will enable them to lead lives of dignity, foresees over the course of history that a person's right to speak freely and to practice his religion is something that is of value, is not going to change.But one particular economy theory or some other economic theory is a function of the circumstances of the moment. And if the world changes so that it becomes crucially important to all of us that we protect the environment, that we protect health, that we protect safety, the Constitution is not a bar to that, because its basic object is to permit people to lead lives of dignity.

Yes. 

The kind of thing, Senator, that you are concerned about I think was a concern of the dissent, and I know that there are people and commentators thoughtfully reading these cases who worry about, well, how far will they go. When I think about that, I think, well, this is a matter, if you actually look at the case itself, that is still up in the air, and I think it is very widely accepted. 

Here I have a problem talking about things that are up in the air, for this reason, and I will be very frank with you.114 Let us imagine, if I am lucky and if you find me qualified and vote to confirm me, I will be a member of the Supreme Court, and, as a member of that Court, I will consider with an open mind the cases that arise in that Court. And there is nothing more important to a judge than to have an open mind and to listen carefully to the arguments.So I am trying both at the same time, and I will throughout these hearings—and tell me if you feel I am not striking the right balance—I will try very hard to give you an impression, an understanding of how I think about legal problems of all different kinds. At the same time, I do not want to predict or commit myself on an open issue that I feel is going to come up in the Court. The reason for that is two, there are two real reasons.The first real reason is how often it is when we express ourselves casually or express ourselves without thorough briefing and thorough thought about a matter that I or some other judge might make a mistake. And when you get the thorough briefing and thorough thought, you find, when you really look into it, that the matter somehow strikes you as not right to what you said before.The other reason, which is equally important, is if you were a lawyer or if I was a lawyer or any of us appearing before a court or a client, it is so important that the clients and the lawyers understand the judges are really open-minded. That is why I will hesitate sometimes and

Yes. 

I think the principal concern, as I listen to you, Mr. Chairman, is the Justice Holmes' concern. As I listen to you, what you are saying is think back to those columns in the coal mine.

Are you really serious that it should impose that the law should prevent people in a practical way, through their Government, requiring columns that protect coal miners? And you are saying, of course not. And as I hear that, I think you are saying a law or an interpretation of the Constitution that would seriously impede the coal columns that protect the miners and protect the cities, that would be going too far. And I agree with you that that is what Justice Holmes would have had in mind. That is why I think what the Court is trying to work out is, in my own mind—I cannot read other people's minds, but it is what is called a practical accommodation. Of course, there is a compensation clause in the Constitution. Of course, property is given some protection. At the same time, one must not go too far, and what too far means is imposing significant practical obstacles. It sounds to me 

Yes. 

YOU cannot answer the question never. It would depend very much on what you had in mind in the statute.I wrote about that case in my book. 

And I wrote really two opposite things about it, absolutely opposite. The first thing I wrote about it is I thought what was in the mind of the Court, and I thought what was in the mind of the Court is they found an example where they thought that EPA was imposing a ban that cost about a quarter of a billion dollars. And it would save hardly anybody. 

Yes; it was like the number of people—they used a kind of absurd example about the number of people who die from toothpicks, eating toothpicks, or something like that. But that is the first way I used it in the book, was to show that there are some EPA regulations which, indeed, seem to be very expensive ways of going about saving lives. The second way is the opposite way I used that case in the book, because that case also provided an example of what you are suggesting; that it is not very good for courts to get involved in making that decision. That is more a decision for Congress to make. And what I said when I discussed the case for the second time is look how the judges, even if they have an example of what they think is absolutely wrong, look what they have to do. They have to say that there is a rule of law that prevents that, and the rule of law that they enunciated in that case was a rule of law that said agencies have to look at all the alternatives, or many of them, before they do anything. But if you take that rule of law seriously, how can agencies have the time to do all that kind of thing? 

Right. Well, you see, that is why the courts are not the right ones to decide. I mean, I cannot say never, because you can always think of an absurd case. You know, you can think of something. There was one that Judge Wisdom wrote called aqua slide, if you want to look at it sometime. But, I mean, you can find sometime there is an absurd case. But I basically— 

Yes, absolutely. 

Absolutely. 

NO, not in my opinion. 

I have to say that is a question better addressed to them. The basic thing that I start out with, which I have written and I certainly have no compunction about discussing anything I have written, is as you suggest. What you suggest to me is that you are talking about an area of substantive decisionmaking, not procedure. You are talking about what is the best health policy? What is the best safety policy? What is the best environmental policy? That is a question that you basically answer in Congress. And if you don't say anything in the statute, normally what you do is you delegate that authority to fill in the interstices to an agency. And the agency's opinion in those matters is an opinion that the courts must respect. They must do that, first for a legal reason. The power flows from the people through article I of the Constitution to the Congress and then to the agency. That is a legal reason that has to do with democracy. And there is a second, very practical reason. The very practical reason is, quite honestly, judges, who cannot phone anyone, who have a lot of cases in their offices, who do not have expertise in these areas, simply will not understand the basic practicalities of how you deal with substantive environmental health and safety policy, and, therefore, it is best that they let those whom you have told to do it do the job. 

Thank you. [Recess.] 

I think, Senator, I would start by saying this, and I have said this before, and it is something that has considerable significance to me. Why is it that judges wear black robes? I have always thought that the reason that a judge wears a black robe is to impress upon the people in the room that that particular judge is not speaking as an individual. In an ideal world, the personality of the judge, the face of the judge, would not be significant because when the judge speaks with a black robe on, in no matter what court, the judge is speaking for the law. And in an ideal world, the law is the same irrespective of the personality of the judge.That is a very different thing. It is an absolutely true thing. But it is consistent with believing that the law that the judge interprets and enunciates with his black robe on is in fact a body of rules and institutions and so forth that is supposed to work properly for people.And so, remembering that, I would imagine that on the Supreme Court, what I would be bound by is the words, the history, the precedents, the traditions, all of those things which in fact go up to make this great body of institutions, including legal advice and how businesses and labor unions interpret it and so forth, that we call law.The role of the subjective preference of the judge is not supposed to be relevant, and while no one can escape from his own background, from his own opinions, from his own personality, et cetera, Learned Hand once described in fact, at a speech given to commemorate Justice Cardozo, he described the judge as a runner, stripped for the race. He may have been quoting Holmes then. But in his view, what that meant was to the best ability, a judge should be dispassionate and try to remember that what he is trying to do is interpret the law that applies to everyone, not enunciate a subjective belief or preference.

Of course, that is true. And why it is difficult, in an important court like the Supreme Court, is of course people disagree, often, about how, in vast, uncertain, open areas of law, where there are such good arguments on both sides of such important policy issues, of course people disagree about what the proper outcome of those issues is. But in trying to find the correct solution, the helpful solution consistent with the underlying human85-742 - 95 - 5120 purpose, the judge follows canons, practices, rules, cases, procedures, all those things that help define the role of the judge, which is the same for judge A as it is for judge B.

Almost always. Almost always. 

The reason that I hesitate a little is because of course, there are instances, particularly with the Constitution and other places, where it is so open and unclear as to just how the Framers or the authors intended it. 

Yes. 

SO is Chloe. Chloe was out last summer in Los Angeles. She was working with a minority religious group, the Vietnamese Buddhists, and they were actually having a very practical problem, because they were trying to set up home temples in areas of the city where the rules and regulations had made it tough for them, and the question was could you work that out in a way that both satisfied the needs of the city and also allowed these people to practice their religion. That was terribly important. So she is also very interested in that.121 

Of course. 

Of course, and the particular case, I found extremely difficult. Why? I will tell you a little bit about it. If you go back into the Constitution, even free speech, I read recently it really descends historically from the need to protect religion. There is nothing more important to a person or to that person's family than a religious principle, and there is nothing more important to a family that has those principles than to be able to pass those principles and beliefs on to the next generation. That is why schools are so important in this area. That is why people feel so strongly about schooling. So one starts with the realization that what was at issue in the first amendment, I think both for speech and for religion, was a decision made sometime around the 17th century, that it is about time to stop killing each other because of religious beliefs, and what we are going to do is respect the religion of each other, and people are going to be free to practice that religion and to pass it on to their families. They are going to teach their children, and their children can teach their children. That is absolutely basic. 

The opposite side of the coin is that, of course, the people, as organized in government, have an interest to see that you or I or any other family do not abuse our children, and they have an interest in seeing that our children, each other's children, do receive some kind of education—that they learn how to read, they learn how to write, they learn mathematics—and for that reason, it is absolutely well-established that although people can teach their children at home if they wish, because of the need to pass on their religion, it is equally well-established that the State has some interest in seeing that education is going on and that the children are being taught. Now, in that particular case, it was a little unusual because the argument came up—and I read through that record with pretty great care—and what had gone on, I think, was everyone in the State said they could teach their children at home, that particular religious group. There were some complaints about the quality of the education—they had a special school—and everybody agreed that the school system could go in and look and see what was being done. Indeed, the religious school itself had said at one point, We do not mind if you come in and look; what we do not want to do is we do not want to acknowledge the school board, because we believe there is no higher authority than God. And the school board, making an effort to accommodate, had said, Do not acknowledge us; we do not want you to acknowledge us. Just let us look and see what is happening, the same way as you might any visitor at all. And then the school had said, Yes, that is OK. But somehow in the legal argument in the lower court, that became a little confused, and before you know it, what had happened was that the lower court had entered a decree which said the way to go about this,122 State, is to test the children after they leave school; while the State had said, no, no, it is better to go in and see.Now, there, the question was does the Constitution require afterschool testing, or does it require visits, or is it up to the State? And that is a rather narrow point, and what we held in the case, unanimously, was that the Constitution does not require after-school testing; if the State wants to do it that way, they could. But you see, some people might think that was more restrictive; others might think it was less restrictive. In other words, it was a fairly narrow technical matter growing out of the record.

Yes, yes. 

The principle is absolutely right. 

Right. 

It is important; there is no question it is important. The establishment clause has tremendous foresight, tremendous foresight, I think. The simple model—there is always in my mind, like, two or three fairly simple things—I think of the establishment clause, I think of Jefferson, and I think of a wall. And the reason that there was that wall, the reason, which has become so much more important perhaps even now than it was then, is that we are a country of so many different people, of so many different religions, and it is so terribly important to members of each religion to be able to practice that religion freely, to be able to pass that religion on to their children. And each religion in a country of many, many different religions would not want the State to side with some other religion, so each must be concerned that the State remain neutral.Then, there are also cases arising. And when cases arise with secular institutions, the question becomes have you injected too much religion into them. You can inject some—I mean, you have chaplains in Congress. Schools—what about schools? You see teaching your own children—it becomes very important not to, in a secular school, inject much religion into a school.What of the other side of the wall? Can the State aid religion? The answer is certainly, sometimes. Nobody thinks—nobody thinks—that you are not going to send the fire brigade if the church catches fire. Nobody thinks that the church does not have the advantage of public services. The question becomes when is it too much. And again, schools are critically important because of the importance of schools to religious people.So that is the framework that I use, and in trying to decide whether and when, what is too much, of course you look at history, and you look at tradition, and you look at the current world as we live it in the United States.

NO; no one is going to say—to use an extreme example—no one would say that if the church is on fire, do not send the fire department. No one would say that the public services of a city are not available to the church. The question becomes when have you gone too far in terms of trying to preserve a country of many different religions where Government is basically neutral as among them.Those are very difficult questions. 

Yes, absolutely. That is true. 

Right. 

There is. 

That is very specific, and I 

It sounds as if it is—as you said, it sounds as if it is a relevant factor. And I understand the point and agree that it is not absolute, these things, and I do think—it sounds as if it would be a relevant factor. 

Well, you bring up matters, Senator, which sound as if they are relevant. 

Would you repeat that, what was good? 

That is true. 

Senator, the reason I laugh 

The reason I laugh is that that article was awfully important to me, because what turned on that article for me was a job. The question was whether I would get tenure, so I put quite a lot of effort into that article.125 

AS you point out, Congress has passed a statute since then. The law has changed since then. I certainly would follow the statute rather than views, but I cannot resist saying this: that recently I did reread that section on the computer part, and what I thought at that time years ago—it was 25 years ago—I think a lot of the computer people thought that what we would all be doing is we would have like a big electricity plant or something in the middle of the city and everybody would be hooked up to this thing with wires, and you would have the terminal that went up to this big computer utility. And then, if that had been so, I said, well, you do not really necessarily need copyright to protect the program because the guy owning the utility, which would probably be regulated, could just charge. You would come to the same thing. Then I put in a paragraph and said, you know, it would be different if what happened would be that everybody would have his own little computer, and the programs would be made by 100 or 1,000 different companies, and they would sell them off the shelf, and it would be really easy to copy them. And then I do not know what we would do. So I do not know that I have to change that view because it was 

The basic principles arise really out of article III. Article III of the Constitution says the judicial powers shall extend to all cases. It talks about cases, and it talks about controversies. And some of the rules that you mention are really designed to make certain that the courts decide real .cases and real controversies. I think that those are principles that people agree upon. I think there is another principle that they agree upon, and that is when you in Congress pass a statute, there are certain groups of people whom that statute means to protect. And there are also126 a lot of people, when your statute is unclear in this respect, that might argue their way into protection.Now, any of those people, if they are really hurt, should be able to bring a lawsuit, because those are people that you mean to protect, or at least arguably you mean to protect them, from the very kind of injury that you are worried about in that statute. I think most people would agree with that.Then there are areas of what I would call gray areas in the law about whether the Court is pushing a little bit more this way or a little bit more that way in respect to how we go about making a little more concrete what I have just said generally. On those matters, I think I should like to reserve judgment, because I think that those are matters that are very much at issue in Supreme Court cases.

Thank you, Senator. 

Some things seem fairly obvious to me, Senator, and I think that was one of them. I suppose I was restrained in that. I guess it is fairly obvious, isn't it, that you are not going to pay a woman less for doing the same job as a man? What is very easy to me is I think of Chloe and I think of Nell, and they are going to be in the workplace. And, my goodness, I should come back and somebody should have to tell somebody that a woman is going to make less money for doing the same thing or is going to have some other onerous condition that a man would not have?I mean, you try to explain that to Chloe or to Nell or to any other woman in the workplace. There is no explanation. And I would think in 1994 that that is rather clear to people. I would think it is rather difficult to make a defense saying, oh, dear, I did not know that. What else is there to say?You see, I start with certain things that I assume is fairly obvious.

I have said in my book that I think regulation is necessary in those areas. I guess if you wanted a simple statement, a simple statement, I wrote a book review not too long ago in which I tried—because it was written about the economics of AIDS. And I wanted to explain in that book what I saw as an important difference, as you have said, actually, an important difference between what you might call classical economic regulation, like airlines or trucks, and the regulation involving health, safety, and the environment.I said as to the first, trucking, airlines, it is not really surprising that economics may help. It is not the whole story, but it tells a significant amount of the story because our object there is to get low prices for consumers. And maybe economics can help us.When you start talking about health, safety, and the environment, the role is much more limited because, there, no one would think that economics is going to tell you how you ought to spend helping the life of another person. If, in fact, people want to spend a lot of money to help save earthquake victims in California, who could say that was wrong? And what I ended up there saying is that in this kind of area, it is probably John Donne, the poet, who has more to tell us about what to do than Adam Smith, the economist. That is a decision for Congress to make reflecting the values of people.So I tried to draw that distinction, and that does not mean all those areas work perfectly either. Everyone can have a lot of criticisms about every area, but, nonetheless, there is a difference in the way economics feeds into the enterprise. And that is what I have tried to spell out in that review.

That decision reflected an administrative agency's rules and regulations that had evolved slowly over time. Those rules and regulations followed from a statute that Congress enacted. They might not have been perfect, but basically it was the administrative agency's job and the courts over time had ratified that job to work out a system that would remove dangerous drugs from the market. The particular drug in question fell within that system, and I thought there—and I think now, and I think the law reflects that— that it is risky for courts to start monkeying around with a caseby-case deviation from a regulatory system that has been thoughtfully worked out over the years. You cannot say never with anything. But you have to remember that the basic statute designed to protect people has been worked out in Congress, delegated to the agency, and when that works fairly well over the course of time, it is not surprising that the law says follow what the agency says. That is what I think was basically going on there. 

I think that decision, again, reflects the need for courts to go back to the underlying intent of Congress, and I think it reflects our own court's view of what that intent was in respect to environmental impact statements. Basically, there had been an environmental impact statement that was going to permit—the Interior Department wanted to drill for oil off George's Bank. But between the time they first looked at it and the time it came up to our court, everybody had changed his mind about how much oil was likely to be there. They first thought billions of barrels. They second thought hardly any. The question was: Do they have to go prepare a new environmental impact statement if they still want to drill? They did still want to drill. Our court said if you do, you better prepare a new statement. Why? Because there has been such a big change. You might want to hurt the environment if you are going to get billions of barrels, but, really, do you really want to hurt the environment for a little bit? Now, what had been argued on the other side of that case was: Well, we will do the statement; just let us go forward with our auction in the meantime. But we said no, that is not the purpose of the environmental impact statement. The purpose of that state-ment is to make this great bureaucracy think about this hard before the gears start in motion.So do not go let out the bids and everything and then write the statement, because once the agency is committed to the action, it is too late to write statements.The very purpose of the law, to protect the environment in this area, is to get the statement written before the agency becomes bureaucratically committed to a course of action that could hurt the environment. And that is what was going on in that opinion.

I think that you decided, Senator, and the other Senators on this committee decided, at that time correctly, that the public was very confused about sentencing. A judge would sentence a robber to 6 years in jail, but the robber would be out after 2. Sometimes, the judge would sentence him to 18 years for a violent robbery, and he would be out after 6. Sometimes, the judge would sentence him to 8, and he would not be out until after 7. No one knew what in fact was happening, and the public's cynicism grew. Therefore, you and this committee and the Congress decided that under the new Federal sentencing system, the sentence given by the judge would be the sentence that was served—not completely; there is 15 percent good time that could be awarded—but basically, the sentence given would be the sentence served, and that is what has happened. The second basic objective that you had, which I think still is a worthy objective, I could describe like this: Many judges in the first circuit have a lot of experience in sentencing, and they do it well. Judge Toro, the chief judge in Massachusetts, across the hall, for many years would describe to me how he sentenced people, and it seemed very sensible. But then, a different judge in Los Angeles, let us say, an equally good judge, an outstanding judge, would sentence the same kind of person for the same kind of crime, and the results would be dramatically different. So what you said is that the sentence should not depend on who the judge is. In New York, they would have a wheel and assign judges by lottery. Well, why would you need a wheel, unless people thought that the personality of the judge was playing a role in the sentence? Well, that should not be. And so you set up the Sentencing Commission to try to even that out. That is a hard job. I think the Sentencing Commission has come up with guidelines that do tend to even that out. The basic philosophy of the statute,132 the basic philosophy of the guidelines, is that they will write guidelines that apply to specific types of crimes and specific types of criminals, and judge, when you are sentencing a person for a particular kind of crime, a particular kind of person, you follow the guidelines. That gives you very little leeway—if you have an ordinary case. Judge, if you have an unusual case, you may depart from the guidelines. Use your own judgment there. But you have to give your reason, and it will be reviewable in a court of appeals.Now, that is the basic theory. Guidelines, I know, are controversial. I know that these guidelines have not worked perfectly. But it does seem to me to be a step in the right direction toward more uniform justice and toward more uniform justice and toward more understandable justice so that people will understand that punishments are uniformly applied, and the punishment announced is the punishment that will be given.

Well, what I have said publicly, Senator 

This is a legislative matter. This is a legislative matter, and I think that Congress will in its wisdom determine that political matter. I have expressed in my writings sometimes some criticism of that. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

Thank you.135 

Thank you. 

Thank you. I think that is a good question. I think that is an important question, and the short answer to the question is: Of course, a judge should not legislate from the bench. The difficult part of the question is how you know. How do you know when there are broad, open areas of law? And I think you137 ask yourself two things. Particularly if it's a statute, you ask yourself who did Congress give the power to, to fill in the blanks?One strong possibility is they gave it to someone else like the executive branch or they kept it for themselves.Another question you ask is: Can I, in fact, justify this interpretation of the statute through its language and through its history? And if the answer to that question is no, then there is a danger signal that you are legislating, which you should not do.

I would say, Senator, that there are statistics and statistics. Obviously, statistics must be reliable. Obviously, it is easy to use statistics that are not reliable to prove almost anything. I do not think there is an absolute rule that bars the use of statistics, where they are reliable, in proving a legal point.In respect to the particular law that you are discussing, which is now legislation pending before Congress, I think that, of course, is Congress' decision, and as Congress decides it, so should the courts enforce it.

Senator, if a judge has strong personal views on a matter as important as the death penalty, views that he believes might affect his decision in such a case, he should, perhaps, if they are very strong—and this happens sometimes. In lower courts I have seen it happen where you feel you have a personal view that does not necessarily reflect the law, and you might take yourself out of the case. I have no such personal view in respect to the death penalty. So I would sit on such a case.In respect to the constitutionality of the death penalty, it seems to me that the Supreme Court has considered that matter for quite a long time, in a large number of cases. And, indeed, if you look at those cases, you will see that the fact that there are some circumstances in which the death penalty.is consistent with the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Constitution is, in my opinion, settled law. At this point it is settled.138 

YOU are asking questions, Senator, that I know are matters of enormous controversy. The case of Roe v. Wade has been the law 

Yes; the case of Roe v. Wade has been the law for 21 years or more, and it was recently affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Casey. That is the law. The questions that you are putting to me are matters of how that basic right applies, where it applies, under what circumstances. And I do not think I should go into those for the reason that those are likely to be the subject of litigation in front of the Court. 

Again, Senator, I think there it is not possible to be categorical. I think much depends upon the circumstance. I know that the Supreme Court has held that there are circumstances in which such tax orders are permissible, and, therefore, I start with the assumption that that is the holding of the Court. And since the Court has held that, there could be such circumstances. Exactly what they are, I cannot tell you at this moment. 

Yes, that is correct. That is correct. 

Senator, basically that memorandum was a summary of a speech that I gave to a group of judges in Williamsburg, VA, and the memorandum was attached to the whole speech, but I thought a summary might be appropriate.I think the actual wording of it was a little more tactful, possibly, than it was listing criticisms and was saying to some extent they are justified, to some extent they are not justified.I think those are a list of the criticisms that have been made of the guidelines. I think to some extent they are justified. I think there is room for improvement. They are not fatal to the guideline effort, and I think Judge Wilkins would agree, frankly. I think Judge Wilkins has always been on the side, as of I—we have always seen eye to eye on this, and basically we think that we would like it, as former Sentencing Commissioners, if Congress really would delegate to the Commission the authority to create the sentence. Then if the Commission does not do a good job, then Congress would change it.But Judge Wilkins and I, I believe, have always thought we would like to see that authority delegated to the Commission.

Yes; it seems to me that in order to build the— the Commission was given an awfully difficult job, and one of the difficulties is, of course, you are operating in a world where the judges are used to deciding all these things on their own. And it is not surprising that some are suspicious of a new entity. And to the extent that you could bring sort of moderate judges, not—you know, just judges with experience in sentencing and so forth, and you bring them on to the Commission. I think it helps win acceptability for the Commission within the world of the judiciary.

I think a good person, Senator. I am in favor of moderate judges. I would not like to name names.

I basically think that the judge has to believe more and it has to be true that there is more. The judge cannot act unless there is more than a simple belief that there is a social problem. Rather, it must be the case that there is a statute or the Constitution itself that creates a law that perhaps another branch of Government would be better off implementing the sub-laws or statutes or regulation. But basically the judge's decision must be tied back to a law, just as the greatest law which has lead to the greatest change is the 14th amendment to the Constitution. And judges who implemented that great law, which promised fairness140 to all Americans, were not following their own point of view. They were, rather, carrying out the basic promise of fairness that was written into the Constitution. And it is that grounding of law that I think made those decisions lawful, justified, and effective.

The primary audience to which I have addressed what I have written on this subject is the Congress, the regulators, the environmentalists, the health groups, the industry—those who are affected and who have a direct stake in the regulation. And basically there I have said this is what the situation seems to be. If you agree, fine. And then it is up to you to implement that, primarily through rules and regulations and statutes, not judicial decisions. And they either will or will not agree.

I think, Senator, that that right is an important right that, I think it is widely recognized, stems from the first amendment to the Constitution, which is designed to protect what is so very important to every American and every American's family: the right to practice your own religion, the right to pass on your religious beliefs to your children. That is there, and it is protected in the expression of free religion.The Government, of course, has some interest to see that education is actually taking place. There is always a Government interest in making certain that there is some kind of education really going on. To balance those two things is difficult and requires fine judgments in particular cases.When I wrote my case on the subject, the law itself, which since at the constitutional level changed, required that balancing. You in Congress have written a statute that goes back to that balancing approach. I can go no further because I think that that statute is likely to be the subject of litigation.

I think there are two separate questions there, Senator. The simple answer is yes, but there are two parts to the answer. To what extent does the Constitution itself and the 10th amendment prevent Congress from acting? And I think there most people would believe there is some kind of a core in respect to State activity, particularly at the governmental level, protecting, say, the State government from others saying whether it should have one house in a legislature or two houses in a legislature. The way in which the State sets up its own governmental institutions, whether that is protected by the 10th amendment or the republican form of government clause or something else is a matter of debate. But I think it is widely accepted there is some range of constitutional protection. Beyond that, although the Supreme Court in the League of Cities case began to expand the area of constitutional protection to include wages and hours of municipal employees, that sort of thing, it then retracted that view in Garcia. And where we stand today is, yes, there is protection, but it seems that most of the degree of protection is up to Congress. After all, Congress talks to the mayors, talks to the Governors, develops programs of cooperation, decides what the role of the State or the city will be, and thus it becomes primarily a congressional decision to tailor programs that appropriately recognize the roles of the States. 

I smile a little, Senator, because it seems to me that that is an excellent example of your last question. Indeed, I know there are great difficulties, and I know you are more familiar with those difficulties than I by quite a long shot. And you are the person who is very sensitive to the problems of the towns and the States and the cities that may arise from those mandates. And I do believe that those problems are best translated—indeed, I think that is the state of constitutional law at the moment, as I understand it. I am hesitant because I am not an expert on this point. But basically that is transmitted through Congress, and Congress will give appropriate recognition to that kind of concern. 

Senator, I was quite lucky about, I guess, lVfe, 2 years ago now and was at this conference I spoke of earlier with 500 Russian judges, and they are very interested—there I would get into a lot of private conversations. And they are very interested not only in basic constitutional protections but also economic organization. The point that I would frequently make in those conversations is that if you are going to have a free enterprise economy, if you are not going to have the Government running everything, then you must have a strong and effective antitrust law.If you are not going to regulate airlines, you must have a strong antitrust law for airlines. 'Hie reason is that antitrust law is the policeman. Antitrust law aims, through the competitive process, at bringing about low prices for consumers, better products, and more efficient methods of production.Those three things, in my mind, are the key to antitrust law and really a strong justification for an economy in which there are winners and losers, and some people get rich and others do not. The justification lies in the fact that that kind of economy is better for almost everyone, and it will not be better for almost everyone unless the gains of productivity are spread. And the gains of productivity are spread through competition. That brings about low prices, better products, and more efficient methods of production. And that is what I think antitrust law is about, and that is what I think that policeman of the free enterprise system has to do. It is called protect the consumer.

Yes, sir, I did. 

Yes, sir, I did. [Laughter.] 

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

I think, Senator, that I should start with a general point, a negative general point, then a positive general point, and then something rather specific. The negative general point is, of course, I don't count up how many victories are for plaintiffs or defendants and do statistics. Sometimes plaintiffs did win in antitrust cases I have had. And, as you point out, defendants often won. The plaintiff sometimes is a big business, and sometimes is not. The defendant sometimes is, and sometimes is not. What I am interested in is is the case correct as a matter of law, and I consider the cases one at a time, and I consider the merits, the legal merits of the arguments in front of me. My general positive point is this, where I hope and expect very much that you will agree, because, frankly, I have read what you say often on antitrust, and you are going to think that this comes from things that you have said to business people, because I have read them and I think it does. But there is a keystone to antitrust, and you have said it before and you say it again, and the keystone to antitrust, what antitrust is all about is getting low prices for consumers, not high prices, and getting better products for consumers, not worse products, and get-146 ting more efficient methods of production. And that simple threepart key which I carry around I think engraved in my brain I try to use to unlock these incredibly complex, unbelievably technical legal arguments that are brought up in an area like the one in the case that you mentioned, something called the price squeeze.Now, in fact, as I will explain now in detail, that key does unlock that door. But in order to show how would I have thought our court's decision, our unanimous decision there, how I thought that that key, low prices, led to the technical result, what I want to do is write an opinion that will explain these technical matters, boy, this was very technical, but will explain it so that a person who is willing to put in time and effort, even without economic training, will see the point intuitively.And the chart that you mentioned, which has a numerical example and has a graphic example, is designed to help a person who is really interested in following every bit of that, to use the chart or use the numbers or use the language three different ways to show how the key, which is the low price, unlocks the complicated door of the case.Now, this is how in my mind it did in that case. How can I explain what a price squeeze is? My goodness. Basically, the idea is this: Electricity is made by big integrated companies. They make electricity by having turbines go around.Let's say—and I will use a hypothetical, I don't like to use that here, because I know this isn't a classroom and I know these are serious matters and I don't like to be professorial, frankly, but I think in this instance, maybe thinking of, say, they turn this wheel around and they charged 8 cents for the electricity, and that might help.They then transmit it across a wire. They then sell it to themselves, because they are in the retail operation, too. And they sold it, let us say, for 10 cents. So they make it for 8 cents and they sell it to themselves for 10 cents, and the price to the consumer is 10 cents.Now, the plaintiff in this case came along and said, you see, 8 cents is what we have to pay for it, because they sold a little bit to independent retailers, too, and that plaintiff was an independent retailer. And that independent retailer was saying, wait, I buy this for 8 cents and they resell to themselves for 10 cents, that 2 cents isn't big enough as a space, I am getting squeezed.And if he had won that case, if that plaintiff had won that case, what would have happened is, instead of that price being 10 cents for all the consumers in Massachusetts, that price would have gone up to 11 cents or 12 cents. That is how I saw the case.So, while I know you could make theoretical arguments the other way, the practical argument was that if plaintiffs here won—by the way, the plaintiffs here were not losing an amount of money, they were making a little bit of profit—the principle under which they would win I thought, and my court thought, would drive up the price of electricity to consumers all over Massachusetts.Now, two things: One, the State regulatory commission is holding that price down. The State regulatory commission says 10 cents is the right price. And if you have a State regulator out there protecting the citizens of Massachusetts and saying 10 cents is right, then147 I do not think an antitrust court should come along with a rule of law that makes for a higher price. There is too big a risk of that happening.But, after all, there could be a lot of special circumstances. So, we are fairly careful in that case in the opinion to say we are not saying this could never be bad. We are not saying this is absolute. We are not saying there could not be circumstances where the price squeeze would be a bad thing. But in these circumstances here, it is not good for consumers for the plaintiff to win.By the way, all the facts in the case, the court of appeals, as you correctly point out, are assumed in favor of the plaintiff. That is because the jury found in favor of the plaintiff. Then the question is, assuming all the facts in the plaintiffs in the favor, does the antitrust law require a verdict for the plaintiff. And I absolutely grant you that is a highly controversial area. It is a difficult area, and I cannot be certain as I sit here now that we have come to the exactly correct result.What I can be certain of is what our court tried to do. We tried to focus on where the ball really is, which is the low price for the consumer, and we tried to work our way through a very complicated area to see if antitrust law, which has as its objective, technically would come to that result. I do not guarantee I was right. I do not guarantee that others do not have good arguments the other way. What I do guarantee is what we were trying to do, how we were trying to interpret the law.

Basically, the reason, Senator, was that I think it was our obligation, in trying to interpret the antitrust law, to work out how the rule of law in that case, perhaps in that case itwould have meant lower prices for Concord, though I am not sure how, but even there the issue is what about all the citizens of Massachusetts, what happens to all the citizens who buy electricity.And my belief was, and what we wrote in the case and tried to explain why, is if a little company—and he was small—can insist that that rate go up from 10 cents to 12 cents, everyone all over Massachusetts, not just Concord, is going to be paying 12 cents and not 10 cents, and that is higher prices, not lower prices, and the antitrust laws ought not to allow that, if we are following their basic principles. And then I trace through in the opinion why I think that is what would happen if the plaintiff won.As I said, I do not think we took away any factfinding from the jury, and I understand that the plaintiffs in the case may disagree. I understand people who study this in very good faith may disagree. I understand that there are two sides to the issue. But I do think that what the court is trying to do in that case is trying to follow through the basic thrust of the antitrust law and to determine how that aim at low prices works out in this complicated area. And I think that the holding in the case, rather than the contrary holding, means lower prices for electricity consumers in Massachusetts and elsewhere.I can give you another example, if you like. 

Please. 

In good faitn, I think people do disagree about many of these holdings. 

NO, no; I think that case was a matter of evidence, and I would guess that how much evidence there was was a matter of the court looked at it and thought there was not enough evidence. I cannot repeat to you now. I mean it is just that sometimes—look, let me give you Cartel. Cartel is a good case. Cartel is a case in which a defendant won. Cartel is a case in which149 the big defendant won. Cartel is a case in which the smaller plaintiff lost. Cartel is a case in which that big defendant was an insurance company in the health insurance area.What the big defendant was trying to do to the insurance company was to hold down the price of health care. The plaintiffs were people who wanted to raise the price of health care. They wanted to raise the price of health care and they thought the antitrust laws helped them do it.It seems to me that by looking at the basic purpose of the antitrust laws, which is to keep prices down, to protect the consumer, when you do that, you get the key to a lot of these matters, and that is basically what I have tried to do, and I cannot tell you I have always done it right.

I guarantee you, I will remember. [Laughter.] 

The reason that I smiled, Senator, was because you have articulated the question exactly that I would imagine is likely to be before the Supreme Court. And if I am confirmed and you decide to confirm me, then I would be a member of that Court. Therefore, I have to exercise caution on that particular question. That is going to be right there. It is going to be right there.

Yes, it will. 

Three general points, Senator, and then a more specific point. The three general points are:I do not think there is a word in that opinion that suggests, you know, the kind of thing that you mentioned in that latter, that this155 powerful State can do what it wants to end the ability of parents to pass on their religion to their children.The second general point is that everything I have learned about the first amendment—and, interestingly enough, speech has something to do with it, too—is that that really grew out of the religious wars of the 17th century, and that really reflects a great compromise that runs through modern life in a lot of countries, but particularly in the United States. And, that is, people have strongly held religious beliefs, and there are synagogues and there are churches and there are mosques and there are dozens of different religious groups. And, that is, that every one of those groups will have the right to practice their own religion and to pass that religion on to their children. That is right at the heart of it.The third general point is that the test that I was applying constitutionally in that case was before the recent Smith case. The recent Smith case said all you do is look to see if there is a secular purpose. I take it if that had been the law at the time, it would not have even been close. And what you have tried to do is go back to restore the type of balancing test that I used in that opinion.Now, the specific thing in that balancing test really grew out of the particular facts of the case. Some States have laws which say the way that the State should go in and measure whether the home school is doing a good job or the religious school is doing a good job is give people tests. If the State has that, fine and good.Our State in that case did not have that. And so it became a question of whether the Constitution forced the school board to do it that way rather than do it a different way.Among the special facts in the case were there were a lot of indications through letters and so forth that the visit to the school by the school board to look and see what was happening could be worked out without infringing that religious group's basic concern that the State was not in charge, that they did not recognize State authority. And that could be worked out because the State was willing to say: Don't recognize our authority. Just let us look at the school like anyone else might off the street, or whatever. Do you mind? And they said, well, we do not mind that much.The concern in that case, what the school board had, is: How can you really say that tests are less restraining or more restraining? Some parents might believe tests are more of an interference. After all, you are worried about submitting yourself to the authority of the State while I have to bring my child and sit them in a special room and make them take a State test. Some parents might have felt that way. Other parents might have believed that that was a better solution and that the visit was a worse solution.It is very hard to say, and the school board had to administer some system. So, ultimately, it turned on the fact that we thought that is a reasonable system. And it does not really infringe, in general, the right of the parents any more than would have the opposite system.

Absolutely not. 

I never have had. 

I would say this, Senator: The issue came up in the Judicial Conference of the United States, of which I was a member. They have representatives of all the circuits and also the district courts. And I voted in favor of that. We voted to have television, the question was the court of appeals and the district courts, and we would run an experimental program. It has been going on now in the district courts and also in the courts of appeals. I volunteered our first circuit, with the concurrence of the other judges, for the program, but we were not accepted as the experimental circuit.So I have expressed a view that that is appropriate in that way in the Judicial Conference. Now, I should add that before making any decision in the Supreme Court of the United States, if that160 issue arose. Obviously, I would listen to other members of the court and try to understand their points of view and what they were thinking, too.

There is a core of political speech, but it is not the only thing at the core. It seems to me that there are a cluster of things that are at the core of the first amendment, including expression of a person as he talks, as he creates, and also including what I think of as a dialogue in a civilized society. What do I mean by that? Actually, it is Michael, my son, who really gave me a good compliment once that sat me thinking about this. I don't always get compliments from him.What he said was, well, we did used to argue a lot at the dinner table, I mean discuss, and he said, "You know," he said, "I always felt you were listening to me." That, of course, doesn't always mean we agree. But, you see, there is something in that idea of listening that promotes the dignity of the person who is listened to.I have noticed in court sometimes, if there are two people arguing, I will listen and then I try to repeat the argument in my own words to the other side. As you go back and forth, it promotes a good feeling, because people feel they have been listened to, even if you disagreed with them. You took in what they were saying.Now, that kind of conversation that has to do with dignity and the way that the democracy functions, the expressive vale of speech, the political value of free speech, all of those things are a cluster of things. Then, as you move out sort of from that center in different ways, you can discover that some of those things are mixed with more conduct or some of those things are mixed with activity that could cause a lot of harm. That was Holmes' point, you can't yell fire in a crowded theater.You could find it in some areas that the expressive value and the political value is totally gone and there is nothing. Think of child pornography. But I mean at that core there are several things.

Of course. 

Of course. 

I am not going to be or am I in Congress. I understand the difficulty that your question is getting at. I have two reactions. Obviously, I cannot discuss the legality of that particular thing, because that could come up. But underlying your question, it seems to me that there are two important points.The first is what you hone in specifically is likely to be a problem over the next 20 years, 30 years, maybe indefinitely, where you have two important sets of rights that all Americans value. All Americans value free speech. All Americans value the important right to a trial that is fair, so that an innocent person is not convicted. Sometimes those rights can clash, and then you are in a difficult area of how you are going to reconcile. Now, that is fairly well known, I suppose.The other point that I would like to emphasize—and this is a little self-serving, as a judge—is also, as you recognize, not every clash of this sort need be resolved in a court. That is, I have always thought that the press, too, is sensitive to the problems of fair trial. I have always thought that lawyers, too, are sensitive to the problems of free press. And sometimes that kind of communication— this is things I have said in speeches, I am not saying anything new that I have not said before—sometimes that communication among groups outside of courts, before creating a legal issue out of everything, can help.Those are the only two general comments which may be fairly obvious.

Yes. 

Eventually, the case I think turned on a rule of court, and it was how to interpret that particular rule, and I think the Globe got the names because of the rule, if I am remembering it correctly. But the considerations there are those that you identified. You certainly do not want to close the courts off to the press. The courts belong to the public. It is a public forum. It is a public arena. The court is their court, the public's court. It is not the judges' court and it is not the lawyers' court. And that openness creates a confidence in the public that I think is necessary to maintain the institution. At the same time, as you have just pointed out, remember that a juror, my goodness, what a public service a juror performs. And you see jurors and they are proud of being jurors. They do not get paid anything significant. 

Well, it is an amazing thing, if you think about it, that the public will give willingly that time and commitment to this kind of important public matter. And what might they sacrifice? A lot—money, perhaps privacy, perhaps a great deal of time, perhaps a long absence from work. And it can even happen that they are absent for a long time from their families, and they may— it depends on the case—it could even happen they have to be locked up in a hotel room for a very long time, which can be very isolating. That is an amazing public service, and I think, as well, that has to be recognized. So that is in the mind of the judges who are trying to interpret this rule, and that is why Judge Campbell said that. Eventually, you have to balance those things. Eventually, it is a question of recognizing the juror's right, recognizing the need to run the trial fairly, recognizing the importance of having the proceeding public and maintaining the confidence of the general public. Those are certainly the considerations, and working them out is a matter of judgment, what the rule says, how these different factors play out in the context of a particular case. That is simply to say it is difficult. 

There are not. There are not. 

If you put it like that, it does not sound likely. I mean it does not sound that they could. 

Yes, and, you see, then you get into very—you get into more difficult questions. Of course, one is against censorship, and you can start with very easy cases. Could they say no books? We are paying for statues for Party A, Democrats, but not for Republicans; or Party B, Republicans, not for Democrats. Could you discriminate in that way? And the answer, I think 99.99 percent of all people would say certainly not. And then you get into more difficult areas, and you have on the one hand the ability of the Government to structure its own programs. After all, if you are going to have statues and that is your program, you do not have to pay for paintings because it is a statue program not a painting program. And then you get into all kinds of middle cases 

That is right. 

Yes; where, of course, I am tending to agree with you 

In principle, in principle, censorship is undesirable. It is undesirable. And when actual cases of censorship come up, typically it is going to be some issue which is a borderline issue. And on this borderline issue, you typically decide it in reading the briefs, reading the arguments, thinking about the particular case and what the particular thing is. And the reason that I answer it in this way is I think that cases will come up like this, and I will have to think about it, and 

Well, that is right. That is right. 

YOU see, what is at the bottom of it, it does seem to me—and people forget that, that it is there to protect speech and writing that we do not agree with. And how often people say, oh, it is not there to protect that. That is too bad, that is—but that is what it is there for. And that principle, I think, is exhibited in lots and lots of different ways. And I think that is a fairly absolute principle. 

I do not know if there is a test—I mean, usually in court cases there are so often two different problems. One is the problem of what is this line you try to work out what the correct result is. And then the next question, which is tied into the first, is: How do you communicate the result? How do you communicate it to lots of other judges and lawyers and people who have to live with the rules? One way of communicating it is creating a lot of sub-rules, but there are other ways to communicate the idea. One of the best ways of all in this area I call a metaphor, the town meeting. As soon as you say an opinion, it is a New England town meeting. There are rules. Everyone knows you can have some rules. Everyone knows the town meeting runs with rules of procedure, but not rules that choke off points of view. That metaphor is an awfully good way of communicating things. And so when I read a Supreme Court opinion, I wonder if they have an absolute, you know, sort of sounding test. Maybe what is meant is that these are indicia that normally work. You can use a lot of ways of communicating. 

The difficult is, of course, you start in this area with the basic idea that the State is neutral. No one wants to see the Government favoring a different religion. And as long as you do not want to see the Government favoring a different religion, that means the Government cannot favor your religion either. Then no one says that it is absolute. No one believes that the ordinary services—fire department, police, many, many such services—are not available to religious institutions as well. Of course they are.165 And then the question is: Where do you draw the line? How much can the Government do without treading—without crossing that barrier and creating the kind of favoritism that the establishment clause was designed to prevent? That is where I start in the way I think about it. 

That is true, yes. 

Or a religion 

I think that is basic. The Supreme Court has, I think, been very clear about that. Very clear. 

I start and we do start with the basic accepted principle that the Supreme Court makes clear the basic about favoritism, as you point out, not favoring one religion over another, not favoring religion over nonreligion. At the same time, you begin with the idea as well that certainly religious schools and religious churches and synagogues are certainly entitled to basic State protection. And then you are infinitely going to find all these different cases, have they pushed it too far? Have they pushed it too far? And I wish I had a magic formula that would answer that, and I do not have it. I do not have it. 

I think it will 

I think that is well established. Well established.166 

I think that is well recognized. I think that is well established in the law. 

That is a very good question, and I have thought about it some. I do not think it is in the ninth amendment, but it is true that Justice Goldberg wrote an opinion about the ninth amendment. 

Yes; and he said in that opinion that what the ninth amendment does is this—it is interesting, I think, if I can take a minute. Do you want me to 

It says, 'The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." Now, what does that mean? Well, what he wrote in that was that it is meant to prevent a certain kind of argument. This is the argument. You go back. Actually, I had read at Senator Hatch's suggestion an article that was quite interesting on this point. Go back to the Framers. They thought that they had delegated limited powers to the central Government. Therefore, that is all you needed. You see, the central Government could not trample people's free speech or religion because they did not have the power to do it. But others said do not trust that. You better have a Bill of Rights, and in that Bill of Rights you better say specifically that the central Government cannot do that, cannot trample people's free speech or religion. The first group then said, wait a minute, you better be careful. Once you write that Bill of Rights, people are going to get up and argue that everything that you did not put in there, they could run out and do. No, no. Here is what we will do, they all decided. We will put in the ninth amendment, and the ninth amendment will make very clear to everybody that just because we have not said— just because we have that Bill of Rights and we have said certain things—speech, religion, press—do not take our statement there as meaning nothing else is important. Do not take our statement there as meaning nothing else exists. So there was a view in the Supreme Court for a while, really associated with Justice Black, that the only rights that were protected against the States' infringing them were those specifically listed in the first eight amendments and the word "liberty" in the 14th meant only those listed in the first eight, all of them and no others. But, said Justice Goldberg, your argument is doing just what the ninth amendment told you not to do. So do not argue that way. And once you do not argue that way, then you look at that word "liberty" in the 14th amendment, and you say it is designed to protect fundamental rights.People have described those fundamental rights in many different ways. There are a variety of approaches to figuring out what they are. Almost every Supreme Court Justice since then has accepted the existence of some, and what they are and how you find them is a big question.

Yes. 

YOU have to understand, Senator—well, let me think about it for a second. I am thinking of the best way to explain what I am guessing now I was doing then.It is unlikely that you can find merit in child pornography. Writing those sentencing guidelines was tough. It was very tough. The reason it was tough, in part, was because the seven Commissioners had very different views about which was the best or the worst or the medium or the best behavior or what the sentences should be for very different kinds of crimes.So in order to create an approach, what I tried to do was this: I tried to say, with others' agreement, here is what we will do, and this gets rid of our subjective approach. Let's not try to get the right order of what is worse with what. If we do that, we will be disagreeing all the time. Let's do this. Let's get, with the help of 10,000 presentence reports analyzed in depth and 25,000 others analyzed in less depth, let's get a picture of how the sentencing system really has worked up until this point in 1987. And then what we will try to do is we will try to create sentences that mirror typical past practice, and we will try our best not to stray from that typical past practice. Sometimes we will modify, but we will have to have a very good reason.Now, that was a principle that allowed us to write the guidelines. And as a person, as a person who pushed that principle, who felt it was an important principle, I had to live up to it myself, irrespective of how I might feel about the particular crime. So if, in fact, that typical past practice showed that whatever the sentence there was, I would resist people putting add-ons or subtractions or whatever they were, no matter how I felt about the underlying crime, because I was trying to maintain a principle. And, of course, if I deviate from that principle myself, everybody else will start to deviate, and, gosh, it is sort of difficult to know where it is going to end up.So I tended in those guideline meetings to resist what I would call ad hoc changes, even though that ad hoc change might have been something that, from a policy point of view, would have been very good. And that is what I think you see reflected there.

I would say probably it reflected a view that this is a very, very bad crime. And I would have shared that view. It is a very, very bad crime.

They are relevant. I think they are relevant. I think that in applying the Constitution in general, one looks, of course, to the conditions of society. I think the Constitution is a set of incredibly important, incredible valuable principles, statements in simple language that have enabled the country to exist for 200 years, and I hope and we believe many hundreds of years more. That Constitution could not have done that if, in fact, it was not able to have words that drew their meaning in part from the conditions of the society that they govern. And, of course, the conditions and changed conditions are relevant to deciding what is and what is not rational in terms of the Constitution, as in the terms of a statute or in any other rule of law. 

Yes, I would. 

Yes, yes is the answer. Briefly, it is a word. The word was inhabitant. It does not, obviously, in any obvious way, describe a person who comes to the United States for a few hours. Yet the civil rights laws are supposed to offer broad protection, and it is not absolutely out of the question. So how do you know what the people who passed that law really had in mind. The only way is to understand the context in which the statute arose and what the human being who wrote that word into the statute was thinking about. And if that was a staff person, which it would not have been at that time, but if it was now the staff person as acting with the knowledge of what the Senator believes is important and what those views are, and, therefore, what one is trying to get at is what does the Senator think about this.Now, of course, sometimes that is all very controversial, and sometimes what has happened in some cases is what Judge Leventhal used to describe. He said, oh, it is like going to a cocktail party and looking over the crowd and picking out your friends. What he is describing is a misuse of legislative history.Very often, by going into those debates, you can get a pretty good idea of what they had in mind, the Senators who passed that, and I think that is what—and I hope it is a good use of it. I hope you find it a good use of it. But that is the kind of thing I would tend to do. That is the kind of thing I do.

Yes. 

Yes; that is the art. That is the art, and you cannot always get it right, either. And where it is conflicting, sometimes it is absolutely inconclusive. But it helps. It helps to try through reading the documents, recognizing that this is a world in which you do not come here with a quill pen and your briefcase. A labor union does not operate just with one person, nor does a business. And there are many people involved in the legislative process that ultimately the policy decisions are yours.And what the Court is trying to do in reading legislative history is, through reading this entire record, hearings if necessary, back to finding out where the words originated, looking at the floor debates, is to do its best—which will not always be right, but to do its best to identify the human purposes. And usually there are two or three several different ones that identify the basic purposes that are driving you. And often, but not always, that gives a key to the correct interpretation of the statute.

Sometimes Congress will. 

Well, normally, you know, I think it is pretty common, and if you punt to a regulatory agency, the executive branch filling in the interstices is pretty common. If you want, I mean, I think it is risky. 

Of course there is a limit. There are some problems it just does not solve. But I think it is helpful, I think it is helpful, and obviously, from what I 

That is true. 

Well, I do not know about that particular case or not, or others that might come up. I think it is preferable, as I have written, that Congress just directly deal with the issue rather than the Supreme Court having various clear-statement rules, because those become all these different canons. And what I said as a kind of joke at one point, I said, well, you know, you can have canons to the left of them, canons to the right of them. I mean, it is very hard for people to draft and to understand what legislation is really going to turn out to be in practice if you have all these canons and there are dozens of ones and they used to conflict. That makes it— in a way, canons can make it more difficult for you, it seems to me, rather than less. It would depend what they were.

Yes. 

That particular one—that is why I am hesitant to comment on a particular one. Maybe that would work. I am not sure. I have not thought it out. What you have when you have like a clear-statement doctrine, then you have to go in and say what is a clear statement? And then you will find a case where nobody said anything, but it seems obvious that it ought to be retroactive. You discover all kinds of problems with canons, all kinds of problems, and ultimately we have a system where—you see, as a staff person, I always felt that what I am supposed to do in these areas is identify for the Senator what the policy problems and issues are and then transmit that to other members of the staff and, through them, to other Senators. And that process works fairly well. Not perfectly, but it leads all the people who are affected by legislation and have representatives or try to get their voices through to you, they begin to know what to expect. That system does not work perfectly, but it is not terrible. And I have expressed a degree of concern about moving to some totally different system which I think would end up with your voice being less direct and having less effect and making it harder to understand the human purposes that move you. 

Your basic point, I 

Sure. Ultimately, you are there with the language of the statute, and the language of the statute is what governs. You know, history comes in where it is hard to figure out how it applies and what it really means, and so forth. But it is not the statute that is explaining the history. It is the history that is explaining the statute. 

I have not read it with enough thoroughness to know. 

That would be for you to judge. That would be for you to judge. My question would be whether there is some way of—I mean you have a lot of ways of controlling the agencies, obviously through the appropriations process, through legislation, through hearings, through letters, through suggestions, through discussion. There are many, many, many ways in which Congress has power over the agencies. The legislative veto was one way that became popular, that the agency passed a legislation, if one House vetoed it, that is the end of it. Then Congress said that was unconstitutional. So I tried in the article that you were speaking of, to think is there some other way you could get to the same result, and I think I thought of one that was not quite the same result, but close. But it is a little complicated. 

Yes, it was a bit gimmicky, that what you do is it would take effect only if you passed a law confirming it, but you would have a rule that it went right on a fast track, not debatable, and if one House

It is a suggestion and it would be a suggestion that I felt was a little gimmicky, and if people in Congress wanted to do it, it was explained and then it would be entirely be up to you.

I think it is a possibility. 

I would stick by what I said. 

Yes, Senator. 

That is correct. 

Yes, sir. 

I think, Senator, it is just going out for bid. I think it is just going out for bid now. 

I think that is right, Senator. 

Yes, Senator. 

I hope a lot longer. 

Yes, Senator. 

I am hesitating because of the fact that this is likely to be before the Court. But I would like to say something, which is this: It seems to me that it is absolutely established that gender discrimination falls within the scope of the 14th amendment. That is clearly and totally accepted, I think, across the spectrum. As I think of the 14th amendment, to speak generally, the 14th amendment perfected a Constitution that before it lacked something very important, and that something was a promise of basic fairness. That promise of basic fairness was not carried out, even though it was in the Constitution, for many, many years. And ever since Brown, the country in all of its branches of government has been trying to make real that promise of fairness. It applies to women, too, and to many others. The test that you are talking about, having a sense of substantive part, and they have a communications part. The substantive part I might describe as this: Imagine saying to a minority person there is a rule of law here that harms you through a discrimination. Wouldn't you, as soon as you say that, think but what possible justification could there be? And that I think is what the substance is, when the Supreme Court makes its tough test. Now think of Chloe or Nell or their equivalents all over the country going into the workplace, and think of some kind of rule that makes their life worse because they are women. Wouldn't you say but what kind of justification for that could there be? Now, that it seems to me to be the kind of substance that is pretty widely accepted and going on. Now, the exact way in which that is communicated through the vast administrative network which is called the court system through judges to lawyers, to employers, to others, that I think is a matter of words and those words may be the subject of litigation. So it seems to me I have to stop with the statement of general principle. 

It may not be, and that will be up for litigation, and I will read the briefs with care and I will listen to the arguments 

Certainly not. I think those will be argued. 

Those matters will be argued. They do not seem to me, as I read the cases, to be closed, and there is a communications problem and there is the substantive problem, and I think of Chloe and I think of Nell, and that is more or less the 

In abstract, you think you do not 

Abstractly, you do not want something that looks to the public as if it is prejudiced. That is very important. That is on the one side of it. Now, in actually carrying out the case, think of the trial judge. The trial judge may have a preliminary proceeding. He may, for example, have to decide probable cause. Well, he will learn something about the case, and he might make some statement in respect to, well, there is a lot of cause here, or whatever. Now, to administer the system, that same person has to be expected maybe to preside over the trial. Once again, that person learns a lot about it, and he may make various remarks. Then there might be a retrial or a sentence, and he will be there again. So what you are thinking of in trying to decide that case—that is180 why I find it hard to find a general principle. It awfully much grows out of the situation. You have to understand the practicalities of administering a judicial system, what is it really like to be a trial judge and a lawyer in that, and then you have to see.

The truthful answer is it depends on the statement and it depends on the trial.

If it really prejudiced the trial, out. That is the end; new trial. If it prejudiced the trial and it is an improper statement

The reason I am being hesitant is that I think these things are very fact-specific, and sometimes an instruction will cure it and sometimes it won't, and so what you do so often on appeal is you look at that case and you look and see—this is where the judgment comes in and it is tough, often, but you look and see, okay, what was the remark; what was the context; to what extent could it be cured; to what extent, in fact, is a curative instruction impossible.I have seen cases where it could be cured, I have seen cases where it couldn't be cured. I have seen cases, I think, in the middle where I really find it awfully tough. They come in many shapes and sizes.

Yes, I do. I do think about it. 

I find help, of course, from my family in that respect because I wouldn't dare think anything, that I was somehow preferable with this particular family, and they are helpful. But the other thing, and Joanna actually tells me this sometimes, is remember you are sitting there and people up in front of you are arguing; think of the advantage that you have over them, be careful. When they make an argument—a person makes an argument you don't think is too sound, so what? He is being—he is helping a litigant, he is helping a litigant. That is his job; listen. And if people are being flattering or whatever, beware, beware, and that is where the robe helps because every time—if somebody is being flattering, you can think to yourself, they are not flattering me, they don't care what I think. It is this robe, it is this robe, and you try pretty hard to keep your own personality out of things and you just do your best to remain connected with the world, to understand that there are men and women and children whom your decisions will affect, to remember who those people are. You think about it. You try to get out of your office, you try to find other contexts. You have your family; you do your best. But I couldn't agree with you more that it is an incredibly important thing to remember. 

Yes. 

Well, of course, because—I mean, you started with the courthouse. I would guess in respect to that courthouse that somewhere between 50 and 100 meetings of the sort that you are so familiar with—you go to a citizen's group, you listen. 

Absolutely, and it was so wonderful for me. 

Yes; I mean, you worry about 

I don't think it would have made a difference to anyone in any of those groups if I had worn five robes. 

And that is a good thing. I will tell you day and night it is a very, very good thing. 

The first, yes; honesty in sentencing is there. 

It is there; that is, the sentence given is the sentence served, and I think that that has helped in the Federal system; that is, I think people who understand the differences between the Federal and the State systems have begun to understand that the sentence that is given is the sentence that will be served, with very few—15-percent leeway. That has helped. The second has also moved in the right direction, but there are many, many rocks on that road. It is bumpy, and I think that it was a very great experiment that the Congress asked to have created. I think there is no one who will say it is perfect. There is no one who will say it has been 100 percent achieved. There is no one in this whole area of criminal sentencing or the criminal law that agrees about everything. I mean, there is lots of disagreement, but I think, in general, if I think about it, it is an experiment that is still worth running. 

Of course, I was part of it. 

But I do think that, still; I do think that, on balance, yes. 

On balance, yes, and more to come, more to come. 

Yes. 

This has been an awfully big argument. In my own personal opinion, the increased authority of the prosecutor has come primarily because of the existence not of the guidelines, but of mandatory minimum sentences in statutes because that gives183 the prosecutor weapons that the prosecutors did not have before. I think that that is the primary source of the contention. I am not positive about that because there are people who disagree with that, but in my personal opinion, that is what it primary is.

Well, what I have written on this—and, remember, you are dealing with a person who spent a lot of times on the guidelines, and Judge Wilkins, who was the chairman of the Sentencing Commission, and I and most of the other Commissioners would like to see Congress delegate the authority on sentencing to the Commission so that the Commission can create guidelines which judges can depart from in unusual circumstances.So it isn't surprising that the Commissioners tend to believe that they would prefer not to have that rigid, absolute mandatory in the statute, but that Congress would say to the Commission, please, we gave you this authority, now carry it out, and we will give you the flexibility necessary to do it; you have tough sentences, your sentences are usually followed; there is a little bit of flexibility in the joints through the power to depart and that is the way we would like you to go. Now, as a former Commissioner, I guess that is the view I have.

Yes. 

These are basically decisions for Congress, and you are taking me out of my role as a judge and you would have to understand that in anything I do as a judge I follow, and would follow and intend to follow and have followed the decisions that are made by Congress in these areas which are embodied in statutes. But putting me back in my role as a former Sentencing Commissioner—and what I have written on this is that the sentencing guidelines are pretty tough, fairly—you know, they are significant sentences. No one has criticized them for being too lenient. 

Yet, they do have a bit of flexibility in the joints, and if you look at that flexibility and you say how often is it used, it isn't used that often; it is used sometimes. The Sentencing Commission did a study of mandatory minimums and found there was really more departure, more, whether there should have been or not, and so all those arguments—the Sentencing Commission has written it a lot better than I have, so I would say they have reports on this and I would probably sign on to those reports. 

Yes. 

I haven't thought about that, I haven't thought about that.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [Whereupon, at 6:23 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]NOMINATION OF STEPHEN G. BREYER TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESWEDNESDAY, JULY 13, 1994U.S. SENATE, COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:13 a.m., in room SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee), presiding. Also present: Senators Kennedy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Feinstein, Moseley-Braun, Hatch, Thurmond, Grassley, Specter, Brown, Cohen, and Pressler. 

Senator, as you probably know—I do not know if you know or not, but my circuit had a case that was very, very similar to that case. 

And our circuit decided—and I joined the opinion—that came out the other way. 

NO, I did not. 

And we did not go into that in any depth. We did not go into that in depth and 

That is true. But what you are asking me to do and why it is difficult is, of course, a judge from a lower court that decides a case one way is always tempted to think, my goodness, how right I was. And then the higher court that reverses the lower court, one is tempted to think that the judges on that court were wrong. Now, in fact, we wrote the case, I joined it, and the Supreme Court had a different view. On the particular issue you are talking about, which is a complicated issue, I would have to say that the way in which the case was argued in our court did not flag that issue in the way that you have put it. And so I am hesitant to talk about that only for the reason that it is not something I have thought through in that context. I know the issue in a general context, but I really have not thought it through in the context of that specific case. 

It is—I mean, you have raised a complicated and rather difficult general issue, and I am tempted to say yes, in general, but then I have a reservation. The question that you raise in the most general terms is: Suppose Congress delegates to an agency, any agency in the Federal Government, suppose it delegates to the agency the power to have a regulation or the power to interpret the statute? And what I think about that is, Congress having done that and the agency having interpreted the statute through a regulation, the Court will later pay a lot of attention to what the agency says.And there are really two different reasons. One reason, which you are focusing on, is because the Court knows that the agency, having been involved in the legislative process, probably through testimony and maybe exchange of staff or being more expert about it, is likely to know, perhaps better than the Court, what Congress had in mind. And that kind of reason, the longer that regulation is in effect, the more exactly what you are saying is true.There can be—and this is my reservation—a different kind of case where Congress quite clearly delegates to the agency the power both to interpret and to change its mind. Now, if you found in the statute that that was the situation, of course, the agency could change its mind because Congress would have said that it could.So I am quite tempted to agree with a lot of what you say, but I am worried because I have not thought it through in the context of that particular case.

Yes. 

I want to reveal to you my thinking without actually predicting or expressing a view on a particular case that might come up. And that, as you have said very well, is a question of drawing the line. And you will correct me, I hope, if you feel I am not drawing it properly. I want to reveal to you as much as I can without making that—without crossing the line to decide a particular case. For reasons of fairness later on and making people understand, I will 

First, I think it is fair that I certainly agree—and I think the vast majority of people would agree—that judges should not legislate. That is your job. It is not the job of a judge. Second, looking at the death penalty, I have said—and I think this is the case—that it is settled law that applying the death penalty in some circumstances does not violate the cruel and unusual punishment clause. Third 

Yes. 

Yes, I think that is settled law. 

What I have said: in my opinion that is settled law. 

That settled law is surrounded by what I think of as a cluster of less firmly settled matters, such as how old the person has to be, though there is case law on it; such as the procedures; such as the types of crimes, the exact details. And in those areas of detail, it seems to me that I cannot properly go because it seems to me those are coming up again and again. The question, the deep question that you raise, the deep question that you raise is the question, you would say or as I hear you saying, Fine, everyone is against judges legislating. How do you, Judge, know whether what you are doing is improperly legislating, improperly putting in your own subjective views, or quite properly trying to interpret the law in an area where the question is broad, open, and important? That is difficult. And in my own mind, I cannot say the text is what answers the question, because in these difficult questions often it does not, though it certainly is a starting place. I cannot say that precedent always answers the question, but it is terribly important to refer to the precedent, and the opinion grows out of prior precedent. That is normal.The history is important as well, both because it reflects an intent of the framers and because it shows how, over the course of 200 years, that intent has been interpreted by others.The present and the past traditions of our people are important because they can show how past language reflecting past values, which values are permanent, apply in present circumstances. And some idea of what an opinion either way will mean for the lives of the people whose lives must reflect those values, both in the past, in the present, and in the future, is important. And that is what judges like Harlan, the second Harlan, Frankfurter, who were not viewed as legislators, would put within the phrase like "concept of ordered liberty" or "those values that the traditions of our people review as fundamental."Now, you 

Yes, it is. 

Yes. 

I think that matters of policy—and this sounds like a matter of policy for Congress. This came up yesterday, and I think no judge, I do not think at all, would say statistics are never relevant. But you have to be careful with statistics and you have to be careful because they have to really show what they are supposed to show. And it is so easy for them to show, appear to show what they do not show. 

McCleskey is precedent for the particular—you know, the kind of statistics that were presented there are not making the case, and that was decided and that is a precedent.

Well, yes, but you have to be careful revisiting precedents. Your question is 

NO, I was not thinking that. I was thinking that there are—what you are concerned about, there are a couple of checks, I think, on this subjective view of the judge. 

Yes; I, of course, disclosed all my investments, including my investment in Lloyd's. And I have three screening systems, now four, to make certain that I never sit on a case in which any firm in which I have an investment, including Lloyd's, including that syndicate, including any part of Lloyd's, is a party in that case. The clerk checks everything, all the names that he can find on those briefs, against the names on my disclosure form. My secretary has the same list and sees if anything slips through that sieve. I have the list, and I have been putting it up in my clerk's office, too, my personal clerks. In that case, and in no other case that I am aware of, did anything slip through that sieve. So, to my knowledge, Lloyd's did not have any direct interest in Ottati and Goss. A different issue, I think, was raised about Ottati and Goss, and the seven or eight pollution cases that I sat on. The different issue is that sometimes, of course, if you have an investment in company A, even though company A has nothing to do with this case, maybe the holding in the case, even though it is quite a different case, could affect your investment in company A. And there the standard is: Is it a real effect, a direct effect. "A substantial effect" is the word of the statute. And the reason that those words are used is that if you are in—if you have many different stocks, virtually any case could have some theoretical connection to something.So what I do is bells go off in my mind if I am sitting on a case and I begin to think that the holding in that case, even though no investment is a party, but the holding in that case could affect my own pocketbook, no such holding went off—no such bell went off in my mind in respect to Ottati and Goss, nor any of the other seven pollution cases that I sat on. That is to say, the label is the same. There is a label called pollution case, and it is true that Lloyd's and these syndicates and any insurance company can be involved in any insurance anywhere, and there always can be similarity of label. But I saw no direct, proximate connection, let alone a substantial connection, between the holding in that case and my own pocketbook. And that, I think, in recent days has been confirmed by lots of people who have read those cases with care, who are experts in the area, and who have looked to see if my initial judgment—and I cannot tell you my initial judgment is always correct. I can tell you it is something that I am very, very sensitive to and that I will remain sensitive to.And my reasons are personal because what I really have, after my own family, is my integrity. And my reasons are institutional, because it is terribly important that the public understand and respect the integrity of the judicial system. And, therefore, the way I proceed is full disclosure, three to four screening systems, and then what I hope is extreme sensitivity to the possibility that a holding in one case could somehow, through some set of interconnections, really affect my pocketbook. And there I will say I made that judgment call. I thought it would not directly affect my pocketbook in any direct, proximate, substantial way.And I will say that others in the last few days, ethics experts, various kinds of experts looking at this, agree—though I must add that reasonable people could disagree, and there are some who do. And I respect that, and I think it is important to raise such a question. And it is important, though I do not want to be repetitive, it is important for the very reason you raise it. It is very important that people understand the integrity of the judicial system.

YOU mean that they had somehow insured that very toxic waste dump?

AS to the first part, were they factually involved in that very toxic waste dump, I believe the answer is no. As of this moment, I have no reason to think that answer is any different. As to the second question—that is, could my holding in that case havehad a direct impact on my pocketbook, that is, that syndicate?— I believe the answer is no, though that is judgmental. And what that means is you have to look at the particular case. And I did look at that case, and I have thought about it, and I have looked at it really again and again in the last few days, believe me. And I still think that there is no direct, proximate money in my pocket through 418 because of what was or might have been held in that case.That is my belief. That is judgmental. I think many, many others who have looked at it agree with me. And I recognize that reasonable people could differ on the point.

That is when I started, Senator. 

Yes; I cannot tell you every year, but, I mean, I would say very close to when I started, probably when I started. 

I would look through the briefs. That is, if I came—I read the briefs in every case, and if, in fact, it appeared from the brief, if, in fact, it appeared in the record, or if, in fact, I learned it from a brief, then I take myself out of the case. And that was basically—and that would be true of any investment. You know, it was not special with Lloyd's. It is that if you learn as a judge that a firm in which you have an investment has a direct interest in the case, you take yourself out. It is simple. Everyone understands that. Everyone understands that, and the only risk in such a thing is that something slips through the net. And you try to cast the net what I would call reasonably wide.

AS I understood it, it was like a mutual fund. I would go over and visit my mother-in-law and family over there, Joanna's family, in the summer. And what it consisted of, my investment, is you would go and spend an hour's lunch with this person who was the agent, who would tell you we have various—we are proceeding for the next year, and anything in the world can be insured. And when you read about losses, remember, losses in some areas have gains in another. You will never know. You will never know how the insurance all works out. You will never know what is insured. You will never know whether there is a gain or a loss. What can be a gain for one company can be a loss for another. If there are a lot of losses, that can be good because then more people want to buy insurance. So in a sense, it was a good investment like a mutual fund because it is all over the place and there is no way to predict whether any case would help you or hurt you if you tried.On the other hand, that word "insurance," as I have learned in the last few weeks, that word "insurance" does ring bells. And basically what I decided—it takes a long time to get out of Lloyd's. You have to resign, and then it takes 3 years. So when I first became a judge, I put it down. I knew it would take 3 years, and I did not immediately resign. By 1988, I had reached a conclusion such as you suggest, and I resigned. That is partly why I did. That is partly what I wrote.I think the thing to do now is—given the issue that has come up, I am not interested in having an investment in an insurance company. It does not affect—I mean, that is why I said yesterday I would like to simply get rid of it.

I would say at the time that I entered into this investment in the 1970's, and my keeping it through the mid1980's, I thought basically it is like being in the Dreyfus Fund, or it is like being in a big stock fund, although it is a fund of insurance risks. And I did not think beyond that. So it seemed the diversity was OK and probably a good thing for a judge, because you have a tiny little bit of risk everywhere, and therefore it is not going to affect you directly in any way, unless they are involved in the case. Having listened to what you have said, and having become acquainted with Professor Hazard's view, I accept that view, and I think if there are a substantial number of people who believe it is imprudent, that that is an added reason why I should be out of this investment, and I will be out of it as absolutely soon as I possibly can. That is what I will do. 

Senator, the rather colorful statement that you read was not made in a judicial context. The view that I was expressing and said yesterday that I thought perhaps it would be understandable that I would have this view because after all, Judge Wilkins and I and others on the Commission were sentencing commissioners, and we naturally thought that it was an advisable thing for Congress to give to the Sentencing Commission the power to write guidelines which are fairly tough guidelines, but which have a little oil in the joints for unusual cases, where, if there is an unusual case, the judge can depart, though the Court of Appeals will review that for reasonableness.Now, being a commissioner—a former commissioner—it is not surprising that I would hope that Congress would continue to delegate authority to that Commission, see how they exercise it, and if you feel they are exercising it badly, then change that authority. But that seemed to me to be consistent with your general hope to remove some of this from the political arena and to try to make it consistent and coherent.So for that reason, I have expressed the view, sometimes colorfully, sometimes not, that to have a somewhat random or different assortment of mandatory minimum sentences is not consistent with that and would not work well. That was the view that I expressed, and it is not surprising that I have that view. I think it does not work well from the point of view of criminal law enforcement. That was the view that I have publicly expressed; that is true.It is a legislative question, and however it is decided in Congress, the courts will enforce the determination that Congress makes.

That was the view of the Sentencing Commission. They prepared a study, and what the studied showed was when they write guidelines, the departure rate is low; it is about 7 percent, 8 percent downward and a couple of percent upward.

If you had worked for Justice Goldberg as I did, you would be fully aware that Justice Goldberg's drafts are Justice Goldberg's drafts. It was Justice Goldberg who absolutely had the thought, that his clerks implemented, and both my coclerk Stephen Goldstein and I did—there were two at that time—and we worked201 on that draft. I might have worked on it a little more than he. But it is Justice Goldberg's draft.

That is correct. 

That is correct, that is correct. 

That is a very big question. John Marshall's Supreme Court played a major role in building the United States of America. It made real the constitutional promise that there would be one Nation. It did that through the decisions that we all know. I think the consensus was critical there to the fact that we have a United States with limited government, with great freedom, that allows us to live together. It is a remarkable thing, that Court. No court could live up to that Court—maybe the Brown Court—but really tough to do. Consensus is important. Consensus is important for a number of reasons. One is the effort to obtain consensus tends to downplay the individual ego of the individual judge, and that makes it more likely that there will not be subjectivity, and there will not be personal views, and everyone will put his mind or her mind to the more important task of determining the law. Consensus is important because law is not theoretical; law is a set of opinions and rules that lawyers have to understand; judges have to understand them; lower court judges have to understand them. And eventually, the labor union, the business, small business, everyone else in the country has to understand how they are supposed to act or not act according to law. And consensus helps produce the simplicity that will enable the law to be effective. Now, how do you achieve that consensus? That is hard. It is not a question of bargaining—I will give you that, or I will give you that—believe me, it is not that kind of a question. It is a question of trying to listen to other people. It is a question on our Court of each judge listening to the other. And I bet you found that on yours as well. And you think it is so much more important to another person. You listen to the argument, and even if you say, "In the opinion, it might be argued that, but we reject that," the other judge is much happier. The point of view is taken into account, and that tends to draw people together. And then, when the different judges understand that their own ego is less at stake, you do not stick on every little minor thing; try, and try to get a view in the opinion that is straight, that is clear, that pays attention to the different arguments and that treats them fairly, then I think consensus comes along. It is pretty general, but I think it is important. 

In my own court, and I am sure in yours, Senator, there is no problem—there was no problem—if people felt strongly, they dissented. The thing that you would like to have the judges feel, and that is why I feel we were quite lucky in the first circuit, is look, this is not a matter of your own ego, this is not a matter of being picky that it does not say exactly what you want on minor things. Use common sense about this. Remember that you are writing for lawyers and judges and others who are going to have to apply this opinion and live under it. Remember all that. Now, if you think that this majority opinion is wrong on a significant point, you file a dissent. That happens. That happens in our court. It is the right thing.

That is interesting. I agree with her about quite a lot, but not on that. It actually helps to put it in memoranda. It is interesting, you know, in our court, Judge Torruella is in San Juan, Puerto Rico; Judge Cyr is in Maine; Judge Bownes and Judge Stahl now are up in New Hampshire; Judge Campbell and I and now Judge Boudin were in Massachusetts; Judge Selya is down in Rhode Island. That is where we are most of the time, and we most of the time communicate through memoranda; and actually, the memoranda help, because you start talking about a complicated case in a discussion, and then people get—"I cannot remember exactly; was it this point, or was it that point, and what did I actually think about it?"—and before you know it, the discussion gets a little confused. But if you get into the habit of do not worry about your English, do not worry about it being perfectly phrased—if you have an idea, put it on a piece of paper, sit there, write it out, send it around. And you get into the habit of reading each other's views and realizing nobody is wedded, but this is what he is thinking at the moment, and we will change that. That actually helps. So I am more on the side of written, actually, than oral; I have learned that.

NO; you can discuss it 

Oh, yes, but you have to get the habit that this is really tentative. You know, another interesting thing is people get into the habit, they have an idea, and the other person incorporates it into the opinion; so you have helped the other person write the opinion. Interesting. That can

Goodness, I hope so. I am a little biased, but I hope so. Thank you. 

We came in—I say "we," because Judge Woodlock of the district court and I were basically the judges' representatives—and we worked with primarily the people in the General Services Administration. And where we entered in the process, the demand for the courthouse—the need for it had been there for many years before I became chief judge, and eventually, through a normal governmental administrative process, the demand led to a GSA study, which led to show the need for the court, which led to funding, all of which goes according to rules, and I think all ofthe funding was provided according to rules. The amount of the funding is set according to rules, and all that I think was applied right across the board in normal way.Where we really entered was that what Judge Woodlock wanted to do and what I wanted to do was to use with this what I think a perfectly straightforward appropriation for a courthouse that has a straightforward need; could that money be spent in a way that would be of benefit to more than judges and more than litigants and more than lawyers. We had a very attractive site. We spent a long time trying to choose the right architect. We narrowed it to seven. Certainly, I think those seven, most of them would be on anyone's list of the best architects in the United States. Eventually, we chose an architect, Harry Cobb, and I will tell you what he did to us that is so interesting to me.He showed us a picture of a courthouse in Virginia, a courthouse that was built I think in the 17th or early 18th century. And what you saw in that courthouse was not expense. It was made of inexpensive material. It had one room, and it had a portico in front. And in that portico, you could see it was the center of the town. Not just lawyers and not just judges, but everyone in that town would gather there, because that building, as so many courthouses in the 18th century and in the 19th century in this country, in the North, the South, the East and the West, they were symbols, and they were used as symbols; they were used in reality as centers of places. Government is part of the community in many ways, and

We had a committee, and the committee was GSA, and GSA has the legal authority, and the legal authority was always with GSA. But GSA was extremely cooperative, and GSA worked with us and brought the architects in, and we worked together, and we would meet every, single week, and we worked with community groups, we worked with all the groups in the city that had an interest in this. I would call it in practice a cooperative process; in law, it was a legal process under the control of GSA.

NO; that is correct. 

The number—I do not know how they calculated it—but the number that I usually think, which is a GSA calculation, was somewhere around $212, $214, somewhere in that range, and that it was right in the middle of the price of Federal courthouses; that is, there were quite a few more expensive, and there were quite a few less expensive. It is right in the middle range.That is my impression. You could check directly with GSA. They have all the numbers.

We have no choice. That is to say, it is built on a piece of land that had a boat dock there already, and I think, under the rules and regulations of GSA, that that boat dock must remain suitable for water transport. It was going to be used for public water transport in the city. The hope, I think, of GSA there is that this could be used for public water transport of all different sorts; the Park Service might use it. But the requirement that it be restored and retained was there under normal rules and regulations. We had no choice about that.

In every public building under the rules and regulations of GSA, I think under the Senate and congressional law, one-half of 1 percent, I believe it is, of the construction budget must be set aside for works of art, and this was done according to that rule, regulation and law, and I think it helps that. 

That must be the same as the first. 

There is only one dock there. There is only one dock, and that is a restoration of the dock that was there already. 

The most obvious place is the speech and debate clause. Let me see if I can find it readily. But the speech and debate clause does basically mean that you, during your speeches and debates in the floor of the Senate or in the House of Representatives, have an immunity, and that immunity, for hundreds of years, has been seen in the law not just as a protection of you, but as a protection of your constituents, those who vote for you, to make certain you are completely free to say what you want on the floor of this House. That is protecting them, and I think that you are protected in order to protect them.

In the Constitution itself, I cannot—nothing immediately comes to mind. There may be a range that I am missing, that just is not coming into my mind, but that I

Yes. 

There is a judicial immunity. It is well established that there is a judicial immunity from suit. Whether that is a constitutional basis, many of these—what I do not know in answering your question, since that is such a well established thing, and how interesting you ask me a question, something I know, basically, that that is well established, and you are saying does it rest on the Constitution, or does it just rest on this long tradition that was a common law tradition and then picked up in the Federal system—that is a good question, and I do not know the answer to that. I do not know the answer to that. 

I do not know how article I and article II really interact with what this long tradition has been. There is a famous statement by Learned Hand—and now, having referred to it, I am sure I will get it wrong—but basically, he talks 

That, I do not know. 

Those are the kinds of questions that have never come before me. If they ever came, I would read the briefs, consider the arguments and think about them, and try to get the correct decision. 

There are the cases that I know and the cases that I do not know. The cases that I do know—as you began, I suddenly realized that while I am quite familiar with a lot of law involving immunity, I have never had to face the question, or never thought through, or it has never arisen, what the constitutional, common law, or statutory source is for the fundamental immunity. And then the area I do not know really at all, because it has never come up, is this question involving the President. 

I do not think I see these things in tiers. I think I see, or at least I start out by seeing—and I might learn more later—but I start out by seeing the individual words of the Constitution that start talking about rights as trying to identify certain basic values or clusters of values, and those values are obviously different, and they lend themselves to different kinds of potential regulation or State interference, depending on what they are. But you, I thought, said which is there is a sense in which a person's own personality can be mixed with a material thing—think of your old sofa, or mine, or our house; we live in it for a while, and think of how it becomes part of us. And there is something in also being able to earn a living that is terribly important to everyone. And those kinds of things—what the Court said in Roth—it is the purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect people in those rights which they rely upon in their ordinary lives. You see, it is driving at something that is important under that term "property"—a different thing than under free speech and so forth, but still something that is important to people. How that interacts with the needs of the rest of society to function will be different, because it is a different kind of thing. That is why the Constitution does not enact some particular theory of the economy. That is why the Constitution recognizes, and Holmes, again, recognized, you know, the need, that it is perfectly necessary for the Government to say to a coal mine operator: Coal mine operator, you must leave columns of coal in the mine so it does not collapse. That is called regulation. Balancing what is at the heart of the matter in the case of property and the need for society to function through regulation is different in that area than in some other area, but that is because different things are involved, and because, quite clearly, as we said yesterday, no particular theory of the economy is written into the Constitution. 

NO; absolutely not. 

There is a basic promise of fairness written right into the Constitution in the 14th amendment. 

Seen that way, there is a tier. Seen that way, there is a tier. Seeing—you start talking about taking away a toothbrush—I am saying there can be something basic, but there is a tier, of course. 

Yes; I do. 

The way in which people live and how they live— yes. The basic values in the Constitution are supposed to apply in this society. 

Well, if you are thinking of—I think the answer I gave yesterday is an easier way for me to make the point. What I had said—when you say that, when I see directly what you are thinking about, it seems to me what you are thinking about is the protection accorded property as compared, say, to the protection accorded free speech. And I think what people learned over the course of time was that when the Supreme Court in the early part of this century began to say these are exactly the same thing, they ran into a wall. And the wall that they ran into was it will not work. And the reason that it will not work is that when you start down that track, you see that what you are reading into that word "property" is a specific kind of economic theory, the very kind of theory that Holmes said the Constitution did not enact. And therefore the Constitution being a practical document has of necessity given the Government greater authority to regulate in the area of property than it has given the Government to regulate in the area of free speech. That I think is the simplest way to look at it. That is how I look at it. 

NO; I think that is well-established. I think it would be—I mean, I do not know that everyone accepts it—but it seems to me a rather traditional—that does not mean there is no protection for property, as you point out. There are specific parts of the Constitution that deal with it. 

These cases have to rise under the establishment clause. I will stay away from any specific case. I think it is fairly well established as case law that the establishment clause meansat bottom that the Government of the United States is not to favor one religion over another, nor religion over nonreligion, so that people's area of personal belief is their area. They can practice it themselves, and they should, and it is terribly important, and they certainly can pass it on to their children, and that is terribly important.But persons who are agnostic, persons who are Jewish, persons who are Catholic, persons who are Presbyterians, all religions, all religions and nonreligion, too, is on an equal footing as far as the Government is concerned. That is the basic principle.How you apply that, how you apply that is often complicated, because everyone believes, everyone believes, I, and I think I am not alone, that religion itself, a church receives some assistance from the State. No one is going ^o allow the church to burn down, without sending the fire department. And there is a whole range of assistance that churches can receive, and properly so.Then when does that cross the line to become too much, to become a kind of government establishment? That is what the cases in the Supreme Court try to address.

Well, certainly people have written and talked about the very kind of problem that you raise. As I see that kind of problem, it is not a problem of aiding a religious institution. Really, it is a problem of a secular institution and the extent to which you can inject religion into that secular institution, at one point, is it de minimis or really why not, and so forth.I think as the Court has approached that, it has approached it with a recognition that the great religious wars of 300 years ago were fought over not just the religious principle for an individual, but also the right of an individual and his family to pass on his own principles to the next generation, that is over teaching. And so it is not surprising to me that the rules become stricter and stricter, the more the education of children is involved. And that is how I see what has happened in the Court, and I understand that there are difficult line-drawing problems.

Teaching history of religion, teaching history, history which involves religion, I do not know of any opinion that says you cannot teach history. The question suggests to me what I very much believe, which is the importance of clarity, the importance of the Court making clear and separating what can be done from what cannot be done, and understanding that a Court opinion is going to be read by lawyers, other judges, school administrators, and those who have to live under it.And what your question to me suggests is a concern that people take an opinion that says don't do X, and then they incorrectly interpret it to say we can't do Y. I think that that shows need for the kind of clarity that will allow people to do what they are permitted to do.

Thank you. 

Thank you. 

That is correct, and when I became a judge in 1980,1 disclosed it to the committee. That is correct.

Retained by the people, that is what I think it means. Senator SlMON. Right. Then when it talks about unenumerated rights, how do you, as a Supreme Court Justice, how do you determine what those unenumerated rights are? Judge BREYER. A very good question. It says that there are others. It says don't construe the Constitution in such a way to deny the existence of others. The word that protects the others is the word "liberty" in the 14th amendment. What is the content of that word "liberty"? The general description given by Justices like Frankfurter or Harlan and others, those rights that through tradition our people view as fundamental. That is a phrase used. Concepts of ordered liberty, that is another. Over time, the precedents have achieved a virtual consensus that almost all the rights listed in the first eight amendments are part of that word "liberty." And almost every Justice has said that there are others, sometimes described as rights of privacy, and in various other ways. Where does it come from? In deciding how to interpret that word "liberty," I think a person starts with the text, for, after all, there are many phrases in the text of the Constitution, as in the fourth amendment, that suggest that privacy is important.One goes back to history and the values that the Framers enunciated. One looks to history and tradition, and one looks to the precedents that have emerged over time. One looks, as well, to what life is like at the present, as well as in the past. And one tries to use a bit of understanding as to what a holding one way or the other will mean for the future.Text, history, tradition, precedent, the conditions of life in the past, the present, and a little bit of projection into the future, that is what I think the Court has done and virtually every Justice. That is not meant to unleash subjective opinion. Those are meant to be objective, though general ways of trying to find the content of that word.Senator SlMON. But the subjective enters into this, and there is what Learned Hand called the spirit of liberty that has to pervade things.Judge BREYER. That is true. Senator SlMON. I do not mean to be putting words in your mouth, but yesterday you talked about borderline cases, and that is what you will be deciding to a great extent, will be borderline cases. When we get to borderline cases in this area of liberty, it seems to me if we are to err, it should be on the side of freedom. You are nodding your head, but that cannot get into the record here. Judge BREYER. YOU do not want to err, but you have to understand—I do have to understand, and I think everyone understands that the Constitution was written to protect basic freedoms, which are basic values, which are related to the dignity of the human being. That dignity of the human being is not something that changes over time. The conditions that create the dignity may change. The needs of the country for whatever conditions that will permit the dignity may change, but the dignity is what stays the same. And how to interpret the Constitution, that is the challenge. That is the challenge. 

That is true. 

What I have always thought is that perhaps the disagreement is a disagreement more about communication than it is about substance. The Lemon criteria say look to see if the Government has as its purpose aiding religion. Look to see if the effect of the statute will have a substantial aid to religion. Look to see if the courts or the government becomes too entangled with religion. Those seem to me to be three helps, three things people might want to look to, and that, I would suspect, is widely, widely shared.I suspect the argument comes in when the people want to say, well, those are the only possible things. Are they always determinative? Should it be communicated in the form of an absolute test? Should it be communicated in the form of, well, these things help you identify? That is where I think the area of disagreement likely lies.

NO, no; they seem important criteria, and it seems to me that what will happen—I am guessing here, but I suspect their exact shape, how absolute they are, how helpful the test is, that perhaps is an area of disagreement; but that those are important factors. I suspect—I am suspecting now, because I am not certain—that there is widespread agreement that those are helpful ways of identifying constitutional problems. And there may be other ways, and those ways may not always apply. But that is what I think is the area 01 disagreement. That tney are helpful, I suspect there is a lot of agreement about it. I am not positive.

I hope so. I hope so. I am not—normally, when I write an opinion—and it may be different on the Supreme Court, if I am there. Judge Wisdom gave me some good advice. He said:If you feel you want to write a purple passage because you feel so strongly, write it, and do not use it. Because people want your result, they are not necessarily interested in your feelings.It does make me unhappy when I see an individual who is getting a very bad deal. That does make me unhappy. I think it makes everyone in this room unhappy. And as a judge, mostly what you have as an appellate judge to give to that person is your time and your effort. So if you think that is happening in an opinion or in a case, you can read through the record with pretty detailed care. And if it confirms that is what happened, what I will try to do is set out the facts as dispassionately as possible, for the facts will speak for themselves. And that can have an impact, too. That is how I have approached it.

Yes, that is true. 

For better or for worse, my opinions are mine. I do sit at the word processor. I do spend most of the day at the word processors. I have learned the life of a Senator is different, and I have learned some of the pressures that you are under. That is not the life of a judge.Both the job itself—when I write an opinion, I have my law clerks read the briefs before oral argument. I read the briefs before oral argument. We sit down and we discuss the case. I send them off to get any material I think will be relevant, like a statute that I want underlined because I want to be able to read it if it is key to the parties at oral argument.At the oral argument, you listen to both sides. And, interestingly enough, most judges will tell you that the oral argument matters. The law clerks often think it does not. But it does to the judge, because the attorneys know their case a lot better than I do, and you learn what is important to them.Afterwards, when the opinion is assigned, I will send my clerks out to do a long memo, and I tell them we both can do research and we both can think. But in a pinch, I will do the thinking, you see. Their job is to get that research done. And they get it done.And they come back in whatever form they want, a draft, a memo, whatever. I take that. I read the briefs. I do not want them to follow what they think I think. I want them to give me extra input.Then I take their input, I take the briefs, I take the record. I sit down at the word processor, and I write a draft. That draft is then given back to the clerk, and we go back and forth like an editing process. And, eventually—I would say it is rare that it is less than 3 drafts; on occasion, it has reached maybe 25. But, eventually, we reach an opinion, a draft, which is basically my draft, edited, reedited, reedited back and forth maybe four, five, or six times. That is the process. And I have to be completely comfortable with every word in my opinion before it goes out for circulation to the other judges.

I do; yes, I do. Senator SlMON. We face a problem occasionally, a question on whom does the Constitution and the law protect. One of the worst decisions in the history of U.S. Supreme Court was the Korematsu decision which in large part dealt with Japanese-Americans, but also dealt with those who were in this country legally but not American citizens. We tend to face these problems in times of national passion. When our hostages were held in Iran, President Carter issued a di-rective that Judge Green said was contrary to the law, that the Constitution protects those who are here as guests of our country legally, as well as American citizens.The appellate court—and, again, a little bit like the Korematsu decision—in a time of passion ruled 2 to 1 against Judge Green. I happened to think it was the wrong decision.But you have a decision in the case of U.S. v. Maravilla that touches on this a little. I am interested in your perspective. Does the Constitution, do our laws protect not just citizens of the United States, but those who are not citizens who are here legally?Judge BREYER. The issue in that case, if I am remembering it correctly, dealt with the word "inhabitant" in a statute. And I think that the reason—am I remembering the right case? Was that the

Yes; I think it was. 

The courier, that is it. 

That is right. That is right, exactly. The question in the case was—so the answer to your question is yes, because the problem with the case arose out of the fact that most of the civil rights statutes use the word "person." And I think it was conceded that if they had used in Congress, when they enacted that, that word, there would have been protection for the courier who came in in this case. The problem was that in a particular provision they used the word "inhabitant," and so could you say—and that was the legal issue. Could you say that a person who is only here for 2 or 3 hours, who is coming in as a courier and just leaving, was an inhabitant? And that was what created all the agony and the difficulty in the case. But I think it was conceded by everyone that if Congress had used the word "person"—and Congress does normally use the word "person"—there would have been protection. 

Of course, I think when there are pressures of that sort, that is the time for a judge to stand up. I know it is difficult. That is what I always admired about Holmes. Holmes believed lots of deference is due the legislature. Pay a lot of attention to the legislature. Let's have a lot of restraint on the judge's part. But then when the right of free speech was infringed, suddenly Holmes said, That is it, stop. And he stood up, even though it was in dissent. So I think that is important in the case of a judge. The irony about Korematsu, of course, I have always thought— and I have rather always admired Justice Murphy's opinion. I think it was Murphy. Because the majority was obviously worried in the case because it was a time of invasion or people were afraid there would be an invasion from Japan. And so the Court was saying, but could we as a Court really stand up to the public with themilitary and people worried about invasion? And that led them to interpret the law a certain way.And what Murphy said was, wait a minute, I think this is 1944. That is not 1941. Nobody thinks we are going to be invaded now. So what is going on here and now. And if you want to say the law might have been different then, say it. But what is going on right now?Now, I may not remember that correctly, but I have always thought that that was an important view because it says do what you can. Even if somebody did something wrong before, that is no need to follow it. He was in dissent, unfortunately.

That is right. 

That is true. 

Nothing that I could compare with those really dramatic figures of the past. But many of the things I was engaged in here—well, you listened to the discussion about sentencing guidelines, or listened to some of the discussion about the airline deregulation, or listened to the discussion about the book, and you would not think I was moved by popularity in order to get into that. But some of instances in the Commission or some of the instances that occurred here are ones where I think people who knew me at the time would say you can push me to a point, but not beyond. Not beyond. And once you get to that point, well, that is what it is. That is what it is. 

It is the Constitution. 

There is no question. That is what judges are there for. That is why they are independent. That is why they are there. 

Yes, I do. 

Indirectly, of course, Joanna works with these people all the time at Dana Farber, in the cancer hospital. Directly, people have real problems, real problems.Justice Blackmun tried to work out ways of doing that. On my part, the will is there, and I have worked out some ways of doing that where I am in my present job. In the new job, if I am confirmed, the will being there, I would look for the possibilities, and I would have to try to work out what I can do and what not. I would try to do my best to get out a little bit of what I call the cloistered chamber. I have been fairly imaginative, I think, at finding ways. So I suspect I will find them.

It has been an enormous privilege for me to have had Puerto Rico in the first circuit. You have no idea what a pleasure, a privilege, it is. Puerto Rico is part of our circuit, and after 14 years, I feel part of Puerto Rico. That is the sort of place it is. I mean, you are part of it. It is wonderful. And I think that the need, the obligation, to pay attention to the people there is an important one. Their judicial system is an independent system. It is a fine system. It is a system that rests on the civil code, as does Louisiana, rather than the common law.We have a special obligation in the courts to become familiar with that code so that in diversity cases, we can get the law right, as the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico would decide it, and we try to fulfill that obligation.I think on the judicial side, as well as on the executive side and the legislative side, I feel both emotionally and logically and in every other way that it is very important to pay attention to the people of Puerto Rico. They are part of us; we are part of them.

The Federal district court there I think is. It is a fine Federal district court. There are seven judges. I think that it is an excellent court, and the facilities are supposed to be in every way—and as far as I know, they are—comparable.There is also a different—an independent commonwealth system of courts, which we as a Federal court interact with, because we get to know the judges, and we understand their work, and there are cases that go back and forth. But that seems a fine independent system. But our Federal court system in Puerto Rico with its seven judges in the District of Puerto Rico is a fine system. The present chief judge, a woman, Carmen Cerezo, is an excellent chief judge, and there are some vacancies down there now which I think are in the process of being filled.

In part, yes, but I think that Holmes means more than that. I think Holmes—and it is another reason I do admire him—I think that he sees the rules from the time he wrote the common law up through his Supreme Court career, I think he sees all this vast set of rules as interrelated. And I suspect, although I am not positive, that he sees ultimately the vast object of this vast interrelated set of rules including rules that say whose job is what as working out for society in a way that is better for people rather than worse.I suppose when you say "Do justice," or you say, "No, no; I am just following the rules," what you worry about is someone trying to decide an individual case without thinking out the effect of that decision on a lot of other cases. That is why I always think law requires both a heart and a head. If you do not have a heart, it becomes a sterile set of rules, removed from human problems, and it will not help. If you do not have a head, there is the risk that in trying to decide a particular person's problem in a case that may look fine for that person, you cause trouble for a lot of other people, making their lives yet worse.So it is a question of balance, and I would say both. 

Oh, my goodness. 

My goodness. My reading—people may exaggerate this a little bit in respect to me—my reading is not like the list you just read. 

Where do you start? I mean, tell me your favorite books—where do people start? They start with Shakespeare. They say, "Why Shakespeare?" This is what I tell students. A lot of them come from some different school, and they will come from someplace, and they ask, "What is in Shakespeare for me?" You say, well, if you are willing to put in the time, it is a little bit archaic, the language, but if you put in the time, what you see there is you see every different person, you see every different kind of person, you see every situation there is in the world. You see people saying things that they would say if only they had that ability to say them, and you see the whole thing in poetry. That is why people turn to that, and they turn to that a little bit in literature to get some of the things that Senator Simon was talking about, I think, which is what is in the heart of that person who is leading that different kind of life. And sometimes you can find some of that in literature. I like Conrad very much. Why? I think because I am moved often by the way in which he talks about the need for people—all of us— to learn from the past and then to give something to the future, whether that is through our families or whether that is through our careers. We do learn from our parents. We do learn from the past. We do try to transmit things of value. And I think he finds value in human communities. I think he finds human communities to be, ultimately, the source of obligations and values toward each other. I read something that moved me a lot not very long ago. I was reading something by Chesterton, and he was talking about one of the Brontes, Emily Bronte, I think, or "Jane Eyre" that she wrote. He said if you want to know what that is like, you go and you look out at the city, he said—I think he was looking at London—and he said, you know, you see all those houses now, even at the end of the 19th century, and they look all as if they are the same. And you think all of those people are out there, going to work, and they are all the same. But, he says, what Emily Bronte tells you is they are not the same. Each one of those persons and each one of those houses and each one of those families is different, and they each have a story to tell. Each of those stories involves something abouthuman passion. Each of those stories involves a man, a woman, children, families, work, lives. And you get that sense out of the book.So sometimes, I have found literature very helpful as a way out of the tower.

I do. 

Oh, I would say it is equally settled that there are some circumstances where it is cruel and unusual; for exampie 

YOU want my personal view. 

The reason that I hesitate to say what I think as a person as opposed to a judge is because down that road are a whole host of subjective beliefs, many of which I would try to abstract from, because as you have had and I have had from Learned Hand and other great judges, there are some to both sides of this. I was pointing out those things where he says try to be dispassionate. And you must remember that the law that you are trying to find as a judge in your own mind, think that what you have found, you must be satisfied that other people would find the same—not every other person, but lots of other people. Where the subjective belief may come in, and that happens sometimes where it is either relevant to the law, or it is not. If it is relevant to the law, decide it as a matter of law. If you know it is not relevant to the law, then the only time at which it enters is if you think the law is one way, and you think your own subjective belief is the other way, and you feel that you cannot follow what you believe the law to be because of your subjective belief, then do not try; then do not try. You can remove yourself from the case. 

NO, but you see 

Yes, that is right. 

That is true, and I think that the law itself provides ways of departing from past law. There are circumstances in which it is appropriate according to the law to depart from the prior decision. Those have been listed by the Supreme Court recently. You look to the earlier decision and you ask how wrong was that decision. You look to see the ways and the extent to which the law has changed in other related ways. You look to see the extent to which facts have changed. You look to see how much difficulty and trouble that old rule of law that seems badly reasoned has created as the courts have tried to apply it. And then, going the other way, you look to see the extent to which there has been reliance on that old past law. The reason I say this is because I think the law has ways of overcoming prior decisions, and those ways, too, permit a judge to abstract from a belief that he would think is highly personal and not relevant. Sometimes, of course, the belief is totally relevant. After all, if you think there is some terrible injustice, maybe there is. And that is not just an abstract belief of yours. That is not just something subjective. Maybe there is. And if you see there is, that suggests there is something odd about this law that requires thought. 

Yes, yes. 

The case was decided. It is the opinion of the Court. I have not read it with enough care and thinking it out thoroughly to know the rights and wrongs of if I were deciding it afresh, but it would not be afresh, and to be—I know this is a big issue in Congress. I know that you are considering legislation

Yes. 

That is right. 

That is right. 

The question of statistics, as I have said, is their danger is that they are not really good statistics and do not prove what they say. That means when you have good statistics, they can be used to prove what they say. 

Exactly. 

Historically, in the simplest way, the Constitution was written; the Constitution provided a limited central government that was meant to secure liberty, and a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee liberty. And one thing was missing. What wasmissing was what the 14th amendment added, which was a promise of fairness. And what had existed before could not have been more unfair. After that promise was made in the 14th amendment, decades went by before people tried to keep the promise.With Brown—and it is a legal reason, as well as a moral, practical and every other reason—the country decided we will try to keep our promise. It is hardly surprising to me, given the prior situation and given the years of neglect, that it will be decades, decades before that promise is eventually kept. But we are trying, and the trying is absolutely correct.

Yes; and I think you are absolutely fair to ask the question, and I think it is so closely tied up with the particular legislation and the particular political debate, and so forth, that I am uncomfortable with

There I am stuck, because I don't know. I don't know what the bill says. I am not being coy at this point. It is that I don't really know.

The Court then will go and accept what Congress does, and unless there is some constitutional problem—and I don't know, I mean at this stage maybe somebody will come along and say there is one, I don't know what it is—sure, it is up to Congress. I reserve a lot on that, because I don't know what the argument is.

In our circuit, I have never sat on a capital case. I think the only State that has the .death penalty is New Hampshire, and it has not applied it, at least not in any cases, so I have never had any experience with this in the death penalty context.In the other context, the normal nondeath penalty context, I have no reason to think there is a particular problem. It seems to work OK. It seems to work OK.

I really don't, because of my lack of experience in that area. I think that you correctly identified what I think are the two basic considerations.

Yes, I remember that. 

Yes.

Insofar as you are suggesting that you have to remember that privacy is what Brandeis said is the most civil and the most important right of civilized people, and so forth, is a right that really is protected by the fourth amendment against unreasonable searches, unreasonable seizures.Insofar as you are suggesting beware of fixed rules interpreting that, because if you just follow fixed rules, you will discover that technology outdates the rules, and remember to protect the basic value which might be threatened by some kind of technology that we have not heard of, or that we have heard of but we didn't know could get that far. I agree with that.

Yes, I do remember. I thought that the case, as I recall it—I might not be recalling it correctly—I think what I was not in disagreement about was the nature of the right. I think I239 was in disagreement about the circumstance. I think what happened was that there were some police staking out a hotel or a motel, and they looked through the window and they see these people in there with guns that are pointed out. You know, these were some drug guys. I think it was a drug bust. And they were pointing the guns out the windows, so the police said we had better be careful about this.The man was sitting—I think there was one man and he was inside, and they burst in and they found him sitting on the bed and they handcuffed him to the bed, and they looked for the gun and they didn't see it. But the knew the gun was there, because they had seen it through the window. Indeed, in the bathroom, I think up above the toilet there was a hole, and what the police had done is one of them went into the bathroom and reached up and there, sure enough, was the gun.Basically, we were in agreement about the rule of law that the police had a right, even without a warrant, to go look for that gun, if they reasonably thought they were in danger. And the majority thought, no, no, they are not in danger, because, after all, this guy is handcuffed to the bed. I thought, well, a handcuff, you know, a lot can happen. I mean they might say, "I want to go to the bathroom," and they unlock it, he knows the gun is up there, they do not, I don't know how strong the bed is, and so in my mind is that the police were reasonable in thinking that there was a danger, and they knew there was a gun there and so they ought to look for it. In a factual matter, the others came out the other way.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

I think, Senator, this document, which is a kind of miracle, the Constitution, has enabled so many different people in this country to produce a government that is reasonably effective, that is democratic in its origin, that permits them individual liberty, and that moves in the direction of fairness.You know and I know that over the course of the 19th century and the 20th century, our country has become ever more diverse in terms of the groups of people who are here. And the problem at one level is what it has always been: How do these very, very different groups of people manage to live together in a spirit of tolerance, understanding, freedom, fairness, and cooperation that will permit them to build better lives for each other?That requires a degree of trust in government, because government is the people working together to solve their problems. It requires not too much delegation of authority to government, lest that government turn on them and deprive them of liberty. It requires people working together to produce an economy that can feed them all and give them decent standards of living, while at the same time they share the fruits of that economy so no one is left out.What tremendous problems, when there are so many people who are left out. What tremendous problems, when, in fact, we are in a world where we have to work so very hard to have that economy working, producing. What tremendous problems, when, in fact, we are so far from the ideal of fairness that the Constitution prescribes. The ne"ed for trust, the need to compete in this technical, scientific world where it is so hard to produce a productive economy, the need to share around the results so that people are not left out. And to do all that while maintaining the basic liberty that this document promises.Those are all the basic problems that I see underneath your words, the words of crime in the cities, lack of education, groups of people that do not enjoy prosperity, the need to keep jobs so that people are at work. All those are symptoms of what I see as those four or five basic problems. That is a challenge for everyone in government, in your branch as well as in the judicial system. And it is a challenge for everyone who is not in government because every single American—I say "us." We are all in this together. We are all in this together.That is how I respond, briefly, to what you put. 

I do not claim any special thought or any deeper thought or any special privilege for thought in this area any more than any other American in this country. Every American is trying to earn a living. They are trying to raise a family. They look out and see a lot of crime in the streets. They see a lot of people who are really badly off. They see promises of fairness that are not fulfilled.They are concerned about their Government. They have to write the check for the car and they have to write the check for the rent, and they have to get their children educated. Life is not necessarily easy for many, many people. And the problem of the country, I do not know, more than that, that is what you would get out of reading a newspaper and out of opening your eyes and looking around.I think that the challenge for us is to try to make that a little bit better.

It is not a positive trend. I have known—some people are better off than other people. I understand that. And those who are better off, in my view, including me, frankly, have an obligation with every additional penny to give back something to other people, because it is there in a kind of trust. And the only reason we have a society of differences between rich and poor at all is because, in principle, that is supposed to work out, so that even those who are worse off are better off than they would be in some other society. And that is why I spoke rather strongly about antitrust because then you are getting back into my area of law, and why I felt so strongly about it, because unless you have a policeman like that, then those who are better off are just going to be better off and that is the end of it. But you cannot have that. You have to have a society in which those who are better off understand their obligations towards those who are worse off. And that is what I think. 

Well, the first is easy. I mean, the first is Brown v. Board. And why that is so easy is because, to me, it was clear. I mean, you know, here is the promise in this document, and the promise is the country will be fair. And they wrote it sometime in the middle, last part of the 18th—you know, in the 19th century, and then it was not done. How shocking. How shocking to write a promise like that into the Constitution and it is not done. And it seems to me that Brown was a decision of courage, in a sense, butthe courage was do what the law says. Read it. That is what it says. We are going to do it.I think the judges and everyone else involved in that, good, they were behaving like judges and they were following the law.Now, a second one, I will tell you, is a little bit, perhaps not as— but I have always felt this is awfully important, and I said this, actually, to the group of Russians: Cooper v. Aaron. Why do I say Cooper v. Aaron? It is interesting. Cooper v. Aaron, which you may or may not remember, was the case in Arkansas where paratroopers were sent to enforce school desegregation. Every judge on the Supreme Court signed his own name to that opinion. What that said is we mean it. But, of course, they are only nine human beings. Nine human beings cannot stand up against a mob of people, particularly if they are led by armed people who do not want them to do it.So what it required was that the President of the United States, representing the entire country, said they said it and it will be done. And the paratroopers were sent down to see that it was done. And the reason that I think that is so important is because that means that, as a Nation, these words on paper are not words on paper. They are real. And that was a definite, firm commitment to that principle. And I think that is a very important decision, the way that was carried out, for that reason.Then if you want to go to third, I tend to think of Holmes and Brandeis, as you know, and the dissents in the first amendment area, though they are not decisions, they are dissents. But those dissents played an enormously important role in making certain that freedom, freedom of speech was real.So those are the things that come into my mind. 

More to it than that. I mean, that is my short answer. The object is dispute resolution. Dispute resolution is important. There are other methods of dispute resolution. But dispute resolution on what terms? Dispute resolution on terms of what is fair. Then you get back into the court system. You have to be careful of saying it is just resolving disputes, because you might be resolving disputes on terms that are not fair. You do not want the stronger party always to win. That solves it, but it is not fair. 

What you are focusing on specifically is not when a Government agency or a State agency tries to obtain information about public health and safety, for, obviously, there are broad discovery powers as there should be in the hands of any governmental agency.Really you are focusing upon two private individuals who are in a private dispute, and sometimes, in the course of that dispute, something will turn up, and the question is: When should it be made public even though one of the parties where it came from does not want it made public?Now, that kind of answer to that kind of question obviously requires weighing the very important interests that you talked about against the interests of privacy. I do not guarantee it is always done properly. It would be amazing if it were always done properly. It would be the only aware that I am aware of—I mean, always, always, there can be mistakes in that area. But I really think it is up to you in Congress to review this kind of thing systematically. And if you think the line is now not being drawn properly as a general matter, then you can change that line.

The reason I was putting it in terms of line-drawing is perhaps it seems obvious to me that in terms of some level of health and safety, of course, of course, no court can or should stand silent when they see an immediate, serious risk to some third party's health or safety. No lawyer can remain silent. No doctor can remain silent.

Yes, and why I am being hesitant is really because I suspect it is a question of changing a legislative standard in general. And I worry that this is somehow going to be coming in front of the Court in terms of an appropriate court rule or in terms of balancing privacy interests. And so I am hesitant to go beyond the general statement. Do you see why I am hesitant to go beyond that? Because it is not something I know enough about to be confident that I am not expressing a view there on something that is likely to come up. That is my hesitancy.So I sort of feel the general principle, that, of course, when you are a judge, as any other person, of course when you are a judge and you see a real threat to health and safety, of course you have to tell people about it. You cannot let—I mean, that seems to me absolutely clear. And then going beyond that, as to just in what cases and how you draw that line and so forth, that is something I have to hesitate. I have to hesitate.

I agree, but. 

It is apparent you understand I am concerned with the problem of TV violence. What you are asking is how do I approach this kind of problem in the first amendment area. That is a fair question. And the way I approach it is that I think at the core of the first amendment are what I have described as a kind of cluster of things.There is political speech. There is also at that core the need to communicate and talk to each other and have conversations where we listen, like around the dinner table, which I described yesterday, which is critical to intelligent discussion and democracy, and there are concerns of expression, expressing—expressing a personality, expressing through art, or through science. There are all those things at the core.Then you move out from the core. That core is very important and virtually inviolable. As you move out from the core, what you discover in different directions is that sometimes we are concerned with something that seems almost like conduct, and the closer it is to conduct, well, the further it is from the core.We are concerned with instances where a particular kind of speech might have an immediate harmful impact to society that is tangible and real. That is your example—fire in a crowded theater—or, you cannot solicit a person to commit a crime although you do so in words. Then you discover there are areas where in fact we are talking about the impact on younger people. Imagine the control that society exercises in a grammar school or in a high school.And then, in another direction yet, you run into instances where the expressive value is totally gone; it is not really communication at all, though it in fact has a negative societal impact. I talked about child pornography.So as you move out from that core, you look at how far away, you look at whether there are simply rules of procedure—time, manner and circumstance. A town meeting can be run by that. But if you are beyond that, you look to society's needs, and you look as well to the spillover problem, that is to say, have you got a statute that is really narrowly tailored to those needs and will not intrude into the core, or there is a risk that you will chill what is closer to the core.Those are a few of the things, and the metaphor in my mind is a kind of core of several different things, and the further away you get in a number of different directions, the more you pay attention to society's demands to come in and impose rules and regulations.

Certainly, as I said, I do not like to discuss it in the context—I am nervous about discussing it in that particular context, for the very reason that it is possibly the subject of litigation; it is possibly the subject of the statute, and my goodness, if I am confirmed, that would come right before us.But I think as a general matter, your point is a fair point, that the more serious real, tangible harm, the further from the core, the more it is possible to devise or try to devise an appropriate

That, I think I must stay away from, because I imagine that should legislation pass, one of the arguments that will be made will be the negative of that, and the other side will argue the affirmative of that; and it seems to me very, very important that one approach that concrete problem, if I am on the Supreme Court, with a very, very open mind.

Media, different media, have in the case law sometimes been treated differently. But I know also there are arguments in particular contexts that they should not be. So it is hard for me to answer that, other than in that unsatisfactory general way.

Let me not talk about the particular case, and let me think about things that were in my mind a year ago or 2 years ago, well before that particular matter arose.At that time, I voted in favor in the Judicial Conference of experimenting with television in the courtroom. That has been carried out. The results are being evaluated. In Massachusetts, television is in the courtroom. The Massachusetts judges I have spoken to seem generally satisfied. The results of that are being evaluated in the Federal system.My particular appeals court was not part of the experiment, but not for want of willingness; it was because they could only have a small number. That is the circumstance in which I think my vote in favor of the experiment is right as of this moment, abstracting from this particular case and putting myself back in the frame of mind I was 2 or 3 months ago in respect to this.That is basically my view. It has not changed.85-742 - 95 - 9

The question, of course, that you are raising there, which is an important question, is the publicity and the publicity on the difficulty of selecting jurors.

That is a problem, and how that is balanced is not something I have looked into. That is not something I have looked into. It is something that I have read enough and heard enough about to know it is a problem. And that is where you start from, and that is where I start from, too. You are worried about the fairness of the trial. You are worried about the maintenance of a free press. And somehow, the balancing of those things is terribly important—and is not necessarily just for judges. 

I discussed that, actually, in a debate that I had with Judge Bork where we took opposite sides to a degree on that question, and I think I publicly there side with the second view.

I can say the debate was quite interesting. This was in the same debate. And basically, Judge Bork—in my recollection of the debate, we were talking about the Robinson-Patman Act, and he was arguing about that, and in that context I think I made fairly clear that if Congress had the intent of doing something that one might think was not necessarily according to price theory principles, well, then, it did, and it is our job to carry it out.In that same debate, we discussed retail price maintenance, and it was my own view, that I believe I expressed fairly clearly, that the laws against resale price maintenance were good, sound antitrust law. I think the example that I used was that years and years ago when I was a student, there were economist professors—somebody, I think, at the University of London, a Professor Yamey, had written a book and had said here are the pros, and here are the cons; what it boils down to is laws against retail price maintenance help the consumer. They bring about lower prices.And what I asked Judge Bork is what has changed; what has changed. Now, I understand people have different views on that issue, but I think I have expressed my own fairly clearly, quite some time ago.

Thank you. 

Let me divide it into two parts—more basic and more recent. The more basic, which I have mentioned—and I hope you would be the expert on this—is that I do remember, of course, when you were a student, and I do not know if you remember in the course that Charlie Nessen and I developed, we spent about 20 percent of that course tracing the history of the Cherokee Indians in Georgia. And as you may remember, the Indians in the 1930's and 1940's were given by treaty—they were given by treaty—a section of that State, and when gold was discovered, the Georgians basically ignored them and said goodbye. And the Indians did an unusual thing—they hired a lawyer who was called William Wirt, something like that, I think. And they said we will bring a lawcase; the treaty protects us. And they went to the Supreme Court, and they were first thrown out on what I would think of as a technicality. And then somebody from Massachusetts went down and was put in jail and forced the issue to be raised. They went back to the Supreme Court in a case called Wister v. Georgia, and the Supreme Court said Indian tribe is right; they are right under the law. And though it may be apocryphal, I think that was the case in which Andrew Jackson said, well, John Marshall has made his law; now let him enforce it. And it really was not enforced. And that I call former, not recent, because I think luckily, recent law is that the Indian tribes and others can go into the court, and the courts respect their claims, and the Government enforces them.Now, what I have seen in this area, which is only a peripheral connection, is that a number of different difficult issues tend to arise. Sometimes, there is a treaty. Of course, Congress has the legal authority to abrogate a treaty, like any treaty. But sometimes there are cases because the Indian tribe says we had a treaty, and Congress did not really abrogate it. And then you have a difficult question, looking into the history about what Congress intended, but basically, the rule is that the Indians have their treaty, and where that treaty is there, the courts will assume that it is not abrogated unless they are very strongly convinced to the contrary.Then, another kind of case arises which you begin to talk about, which is terribly difficult, and that, of course, is a case where there was tribal land, and then some of that land has passed through a history and story of different connections into people who are not members of the tribe. And then the issue is what land of authority does the tribe exert. And it is particularly difficult where that could include, say, some kind of criminal prosecution, where then the person who was not a member of the tribe would say: What about my basic rights guaranteed under the Constitution?Those are the kinds of issues that arise, and on the one hand, you have to respect very much the sovereignty of the tribe; and on the other hand, you have to recognize the claim to say basic rights of protection. And I am very glad to hear you say that indeed, you often look to other ways than solely court ways of resolving these things, because I do think, for example, that sometimes, say, the tribal authorities and the other authorities might decide to have tribal powers that are the same in terms of protection as other powers. If that is so, that would be a matter worked out through Congress or worked out through your good offices, or worked out through meetings; it would not necessarily be worked out in the courts.

I think that is an aspect of the broader problem that you state. And I think that could well be a matter in litigation, and it is not a matter that I am really expert on. It seems to me the most difficult part of what you say is where, on the onehand, the tribe has sovereignty, and that sovereignty must be respected.On the other hand, those people who now perhaps unwillingly are subject to the tribe sovereignty feel they lack a basic right that they would have, if that sovereignty were not there. And there it sounds to me as if what you are trying to do is to encourage people to get together to the point where, at least from the point of view of the person who is there, he gets the rights either way. Of course, that is the best situation.If whether the Indian tribe has the sovereignty or whether the State has the sovereignty, that person is basically just as well off. I don't know if you can bring that about. That is really a political matter and a matter of negotiating and learning and meetings of all kinds that aren't necessarily judicial meetings. I understand that that is what you try to do, and I can just say, from the point of view of the judicial aspect of the problem, it sounds very difficult, with important interests on both sides.

I know that is the subject of a congressional statute, and I know the statute tries to create a situation where certain defined tribes—and there is a definition, and I know there are sometimes arguments about where tribes and which tribes and under what circumstances tribes—but where you pass that problem, I think the statute requires a negotiation, and then the negotiation between the State and the tribe over the details of the gambling that the statute permits is designed to work that out in part. That is my guess and understanding.I also understand that issues can arise about whether or not negotiation is in good faith, the extent to which the court gets involved in supervising the negotiation. In other words, I see the issues and I understand the importance of it, and I am not certain legally really how they actually work out. That would depend upon a particular case.

Well, my substantive instinct is, of course, that if the procedures and protections in the tribal court can be brought to match those in the Federal court, the problem will tend to go away, because then, of course, you would have the same protection in both places. And that is not a judicial question. That is a question of people meeting and understanding and talking to each other and trying to work out appropriate procedures.When you turn to the legal question, which is premised on that not having been done, as you point out, that might come up to the Supreme Court, and I am on that Court, I would have to decide that question and, therefore, I couldn't really express as view about it.I think that your instinct that if it comes out the way that you think is not appropriate, the solution would be legislative. I think that is a correct instinct.

Yes. 

Absolutely; that is why I said in response to Senator Kohl that I thought Cooper v. Aaron was such an important decision, because it is the absolute verification of what you said, that the executive and legislative branches would stand behind the decisions of the Federal courts.

I think you are addressing really my thoughts as a matter of policy, rather than my thoughts as a judge. Of course, as a judge, one tries to follow the law as it is written.When I was involved in airline deregulation, this problem arose. It is true that the general thrust of airline deregulation was that prices would go down for the vast majority of Americans. At the same time, I believe when that statute that was written, your point was a valid point, that in terms of infrastructure, it is important that the entire Nation be seen as a single nation and people not be left out.Therefore, written into that statute was a subsidy that Congress at the time believed would be adequate to maintain service at smaller rural airports, the idea being that no rural community cur-256 rently at that time having scheduled service would lose all its service. There would be some lifeline there.Now, whether that subsidy was adequate, whether it worked out in practice, that is a matter for history and possibly criticism. But the intent of the movement was not totally to sacrifice the needs of those who are not in the populous communities. It was to recognize those needs and to try to provide for them, especially so that there would be interconnections everywhere. That is basically the principle, though one could criticize from that point of view the execution.

My guess is it would depend upon the statute. You have to look into the detail.

I cannot say as a matter of policy, because that is so much a judgment for others. That is, the basic idea, of course, is that it is very puzzling to people, very puzzling, what Cardozo said. He said, "Well, why should the criminal go free, because the constable has blundered?" And the answer to that is, over the course of time and a long period of time, people learned that the protection in the fourth amendment, totally innocent people wouldn't be broken into in the middle of the night, that confessions wouldn't be extracted through violence, that the only way to make those meaningful in practice was to have this exclusionary rule. And it has become I think fairly widely accepted.The exact contours of it and the shape and size and on the border how it should look, and so forth, I recognize, but that is a matter of considerable controversy and debate, and Congress or others might well criticize or want to do it this way or that way or the other way.

When you say satisfactory to me, the great debate, as you recognize in this area, particularly with the death penalty, is involved, is habeas corpus tells us we don't want to have this or any person have a penalty particularly of this sort, if the trial was fundamentally unfair. Of course, people keep coming on again and again and they say, well, it was fundamentally unfair, and then the courts say no, it was OK, and then they have a new reason and a new reason, and so the problem is this problem of delay.At the same time, people might sometimes come up with reasons that they for good cause couldn't present before. So I understand how you are trying to balance those two things, the need for fundamental fairness and the need to avoid unreasonable delay. How it works out in the statute again is going to be up to Congress. My guess is you will get one final procedure and some cases will come along where something was discovered later, and you will say, well, the procedure couldn't have taken that into account. So I think you will improve the situation. I am sure there are all kinds of ways of improving it. This is such a fundamental tension, that I doubt it will ever be perfectly solved.

I am glad sometimes that I am not in the Congress of the United States, and this is not a matter on which I am expert and I am really very pleased to leave that for you to decide.

It was a wonderful job. 

Thank you. 

Perfect. 

Thank you. 

Thank you very much. 

I do not have special insight. As a human being, when I hear that one real child is killed every hour through violence, of course, I react like every human being reacts to that in this country. I mean, absolutely intolerable.Then when you say as a jurist, I think of the Preamble to the Constitution, as a jurist. Why the Preamble? Well, because it has always seemed to me that the Preamble has stated there what the goals are, simply, so any person can understand it. And the rest of the Constitution is a few understandable instructions for reaching those goals.And I see right in that Preamble, it says,Establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and assure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.It says both assure domestic tranquility and provide the blessings of liberty.Then the rest of the Constitution, being a set of instructions to reach those goals, must be interpreted in a way so that both can be reached. And then you pose the terribly difficult question: How do you choose among them?I have no magic answer to that question. Sometimes I have done the following in a case where, in fact, say there is a question of the fourth amendment interpretation and the right not to be seized il-legally, the right not to be searched illegally, and what does that amount to, and is it this or is it that?Sometimes I go back and try in my own mind to remember that those rights are there to protect innocent people. And we protect guilty people because that is absolutely necessary if we are going to protect innocent people.And so I ask myself: What would an innocent person think about what is going on? The case that came up, you see, was a case about whether a policeman could say to a person at the airport, who was acting very suspiciously: Excuse me, do you mind if I ask a few questions? And the man said yes.Now, did that violate the fourth amendment? Though the question was a close one, I thought no. And my reason for thinking no was because I thought most innocent people do not mind answering questions when posed by the police where they are not put in custody, where they are not subject to restraint, but they are politely asked, Do you mind answering a question?So that notion of what do innocent people actually fear is an unreasonable restraint on their liberty, I have found sometimes helps reconcile those two things in the context of a real case. I do not know if that is helpful. I see the need to pursue both.

I agree with you. 

AS you recognize, Senator, the second amendment is in the Constitution. It provides a protection. As you also have recognized, the Supreme Court law on the subject is very, very few cases. This really has not been gone into in any depth by the Supreme Court at all.Like you, I have never heard anyone even argue that there is some kind of constitutional right to have guns in a school. And I know that every day—not every day, I do not want to exaggerate, but every week or every month for the last 14 years, I have sat on case after case in which Congress has legislated rules, regulations, restrictions of all kinds on weapons; that is to say, there are many, many circumstances in which carrying weapons of all kinds is punishable by very, very, very severe penalties. And Congress, often by overwhelming majorities, has passed legislation imposing very severe additional penalties on people who commit all kinds of crimes with guns, even various people just possessing guns under certain circumstances.In all those 14 years, I have never heard anyone seriously argue that any of those was unconstitutional in a serious way. I should not say never because I do not remember every case in 14 years. So, obviously, it is fairly well conceded across the whole range of society, whatever their views about gun control legislatively and so forth, that there is a very, very large area for government to act. At the same time, as you concede, and others, there is some kind of protection given in the second amendment.Now, that is, it seems to me, where I have to stop, and the reason that I have to stop is we are in a void in terms of what the Supreme Court has said. There is legislation likely to pass or has recently passed that will be challenged. And I, therefore, if I am on that Court, have to listen with an open mind to the arguments that are made in the particular context.

I have not heard it argued that it is not, but I have not reviewed the case, and I do not know the argument that would really come up. I know that it has been fairly limited, whatthe Supreme Court has said, and I know that it has been fairly narrow. I also know that other people make an argument for a somewhat more expanded view. But nobody that I have heard makes the argument going into these areas where there is quite a lot of regulation already.I should not really underline no one, because you can find, you know, people who make different arguments. But it seems there is a pretty board consensus there.

I am sure when you interpret this, you do go back from the text to the history and try to get an idea of what they had in mind. And if there is a capital letter there, you ask, Why is there this capital letter there? Somebody had an idea, and you read and try to figure out what the importance of that was viewed at the time and if that has changed over time.

I agree. 

I think I would say three or four things. I think first, if there is such a trend, it is troubling. Second, the reason that I think it is troubling is I understand all these constitutional rights are very important—believe me, we all think they are incredibly important—but one thing also that is very important is just the area that you are talking about. And the reason that I think that to myself is because if you are dealing with whether a man or a woman is getting a Social Security disability check, you do not just think to yourself: That check is as important to that man or woman as a whole business is to its owner. You think it is more important, because that man or woman has nothing else.And I think, too—when I was walking about 4 months ago with Judge Woodlock somewhere in Boston, and he pointed out a build-ing, and in that building, they had worked out a series of part-time people, lawyers, who give a little bit of their time for a very low price—I believe this is how it works—so that people who have little complaints—little complaints—that just means a complaint that maybe, compared to some other complaint, is little; it is not little to the person—and they have a way of coming in and getting some kind of proceeding to see that they have been treated fairly in respect to a sidewalk, or snow removal, or a parking ticket, or whatever—that is terribly important.Why is it so important? That is really my third point. The reason it is so important is it is important to that individual, and it is really quite a wonderful, marvelous thing to have a society that treats those complaints properly.And my fourth point is I guess when I was with these judges in Russia which, as you can tell—I will slow down a little, because I am feeling strongly about it

We were talking about it, and I said do not forget—you see, we have a meeting of the administrative law people and the American Bar Association—we sometimes say we are administrative law buffs—we believe it is important, too, and how many, and so forth. Well, I said to the Russian people there: Please do not forget this part of the law, because one wonderful thing that happened in that part of the law was that one time, it was decided that we would write everything down. That does not seem that important, but it is so important. It was something as a result of a Supreme Court case where somebody could not find the regulation, and after that, Congress said if that regulation is not written down, if you do not have that in the Code of Federal Regulations, if there is not a place where a person can go without a lawyer, if necessary, to find out what he is supposed to do, then it is not a rule, and it is not a regulation. I thought to the Russians that, too, is an enormous protection against arbitrary behavior, against people who are in the Government saying, "Well, this is what you have to do, and tomorrow, we will tell you why you have to do it." So all of those are reasons why I agree with you, I think this is a very important area of law. 

I have said a couple of things which may help a little but not a lot. One is a positive thing, and one is a negative thing. The positive thing is that probably, it is worth, when Congress passes laws, when State legislatures pass laws, when agencies have rules and regulations, a human being thinking about the process of translating that statute, rule, law, regulation into reality. And that means think through when and whether court process, administrative process, mediation process, or some combination thereof will be the most effective way of making that right in the statute real.I do not know how you would come out, but I am reasonably convinced it is worth trying to give someone the job of thinking through that problem every time some statute that affects people is or is not going to be passed or modified.The negative thing is this. Beware of door-closing in the courts. Beware of it in the following sense. Remember that the Social Security case to the person who needs the Social Security really is as important as any other case involving a lot more money.No one will say that the court procedure as it is now set up is the perfect procedure. It may be, as some have suggested, that some cases of different kinds should go to mediation or so forth. But if that is to happen, the people involved must be convinced that that is a better process, and an escape route must be maintained so that there still remains the possibility of some access.Now, that has happened sometimes, like where Congress has set up special courts like veterans' courts, so that both you have a specialty which will process the case more quickly, but an escape route is maintained so it is possible for a person who is hurt by that process to get back into Federal court. In other words, tailoring of different kinds I think is possible. I am sure it is worth thinking about, and I am sure that it cannot send a message that some people's cases are worth less than others.

The answer is I do not think it is an illusion. I think it is very important to look at. I once debated Justice Scalia in the Hall of Justice on this point, and we debated about whose view was the illusion. They were opposite views, and I doubt that we convinced each other. But nonetheless I did think and do think that legislative history is very, very important.

At a general level, at a statement of generality, of course, I think the more realism, the better. I do think that laws are supposed to, when fitted together, work according to their purposes. I do not think a court can know whether an interpretation is correct until it understands both the purpose and how the interpretation is likely in light of that purpose to work out in the world, in the actual world. And history and real fact is important, often, to make a sensible judgment. So at a general level, I think it is important.

Such is very often likely to be the purpose of the civil rights statute, and one normally interprets language in light of its purpose. I am hesitant to go into the details of voting rights, because if there is one case that is bound to come back to the Supreme Court, and if I am on it, I would have to get involved, is Shaw v. Reno. That is my problem in that.

Basically, I think that word "liberty" in the 14th amendment has been recognized by most—almost all—modern judges on the Supreme Court, and is pretty widely accepted, that that word "liberty" includes a number of basic, important things that are not those only listed in the first eight amendments to the Constitution.And the ninth amendment helps make that very clear, because it says do not use that fact of the first eight to reason to the conclusion that there are no others.So it is not surprising to me that there is widespread recognition that that word "liberty" does encompass something on the order of privacy. People have described those basic rights not mentioned inwords like "concept of ordered liberty," that which the traditions of our people realize or recognize as fundamental, and in looking to try to decide what is the content of that, I think judges have started with text, and after all, in amendments to the Constitution, there are words that suggest that in different contexts, privacy was important. They go back to the history; they look at what the Framers intended; they look at traditions over time; they look at how those traditions have worked out as history has changed, and they are careful, they are careful, because eventually, 20 or 30 years from now, other people will look back at the interpretations that this generation writes if they are judges, and they will say: Were they right to say that that ought permanently to have been the law?If the answer to that question is yes, then the judges of today were right in finding that that was a basic value that the Framers of the Constitution intended to have enshrined. That is a kind of test of objectivity. But the source I think is the 14th amendment and that word "liberty."

That is the determination of Roe v. Wade. Roe v. Wade is the law of this country, at least for more than 20 years, that there is some kind of basic right of the nature that you describe.Recently, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed that right in Casey v. Planned Parenthood. So, in my opinion, that is settled law.

There I cannot talk about settled law because that is not settled. And I am quite certain that the scope of theright to privacy that is within that word liberty, I am quite certain that that will be a matter that is going to be litigated.That there is a privacy interest of the sort that you suggest I think is clear. How that interplays with other rights and how that ends up being decided in a particular court case is something I think I have to leave to the briefs and the arguments and thinking about the particular case as it might come up.

Yes, it is. 

It is important. 

Control it in respect to State efforts to uncover it and so forth? 

DO you mean with respect to other private 

I cannot give you a really good answer. The reason is that normally what would happen—and I think it is what I hear reflected in your question—is the first thing that happens is that many, many people across the country recognize problems in this area. Then having recognized the problems, they turn to you or your part of the recognition, and you say, look, there are these different interests involved. There are interests in spreading information around rapidly. There are interests in protecting something very important to people, which is their own basic information and that which makes them an individual. And these things might conflict in the face of new technology. We are not quite certain how they will conflict. So you listen to the technology people, you identify the interests, and then you pass laws. Then normally what happens to the judiciary is we decide whether there is a constitutional protection, but only in the context of the particular law. And it is because that latter decision would arise in a particular context that I find it difficult to go further.

Michael and I have been communicating by Email back and forth from Stanford. I have been trying to learn it a little bit, and I think I would be rather upset—and I know he would be—if somebody were distorting his message. My message is distorted enough without some other person. So I do see it is a problem, and it does seem to me that I would react by trying to ask the questions that you are trying to ask, and then trying to find out how this all works and how you protect people's interest. And as I say, my guess is it would end up in legislation of some kind. 

I would have to say it would depend on how it got in. It is an area of such lack of knowledge to me as to the technical part that I begin with, my goodness, why would somebody be monkeying with my message. Then I would have to see how it arose to know whether the courts would have a role or not. It is reflecting ignorance on my part, but I see the importance of the problem.

It rings a bell. It rings a bell. If I did, it was quite a while ago. 

The case was rather special in that respect, very special. As the beginning of the case points out, to put it in its simplest terms, when I wrote it, as far as the standard of review is concerned, what courts should do when an agency decides something is to respect the view of the agency and to overturn the agency only if it is arbitrary or capricious.Then I listed three ways in the statute that in a normal case the agency would make that determination. The agency has lots of procedures. They go in three different ways through those procedures. And they end up with something called an order. And the court may enforce the order, and when it does, the issue is: Was the agency right or not? And you play the agency's game. That is to say, you overturn it only if it is arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion.In that particular case, the agency did something that was very unusual, I thought. I do not know. I cannot tell you by actual experience how unusual, but I have never seen another one in our court. Instead of playing what I would call the agency's game where they went through their own procedure, they never finished their own procedure. Instead, 10 years earlier, they had come into court and asked the court to weigh the evidence and to issue an injunction according to court procedure. And basically what thatdecision says is well, of course, if you or anyone else conies in and plays the court's game in setting the facts, you follow the court's rules. I do not think that interferes with your ability to do something because you have loads of authority to go make the decision over in the agency.

Yes; four, actually. 

Absolutely. 

That is right. 

Oh, enormous. 

That is right. 

That is right. 

I believe, as I have written the case, that under those circumstances the court would not have reviewed the record afresh. It would have reviewed what was in back of that order under the ordinary deferential agency standard. And it would have said it is up to the agency, unless it is arbitrary, capricious, abuse of discretion 

That is right. The court. 

That is correct. 

That is correct. 

That is the normal rule. The normal rule, the Administrative Procedures Act. 

Yes. 

It is foreign to me. I mean, it is foreign to me. What I have written about it is that that is the kind of decision— my goodness, it is health, it is safety. There is no economics that tells you the right result in that kind of area. There is no economics that tells you or me or all of us how much we are prepared to spend or should spend on the life of another person. There is nothing that tells us the answer to that in some kind of economics book that I am aware of.And also, that is so much a decision that people will make through their elected representatives. It is a democratically made decision. Judges are not democratically elected. I mean, it is exactly the kind of reason, in my own view, that it is very important for courts—and I have written this, I have written this—it is so important for courts, which are not good institutions to make those kinds of technical choices because judges are cut off from information that would be relevant, among many other reasons, and they do not have the time, among many other reasons, and they do not have the contact with the people, among many other reasons, and there are just dozens of reasons which I have spelled out why they are not good institutions to make those kinds of decisions.So that reinforces what I have tended to write, that it is important for courts to go back to try to understand the human purposes that are moving those in Congress who write these statutes when they interpret them.

I do not want to discuss the particular case, but I can say from what I have said and what I have written, it is a fair assumption that I would have looked at the legislative history, because I think when you read statutes, and you are trying to understand what is the human purpose that you and Congress have in mind, a very good way to do it is you look at the legislative history. That does not always give you the answer, but very often, it helps.

What I have said that is, I think, relevant inwriting, what I have said which I think is relevant to the questionthat you posed, are really two things—that, one, if you are not cer-tain about what the statute means—in all of these open, big, im-portant cases, in any court, language rarely resolves it; otherwise,why is it in court—but go look at the legislative history. The dis-sents in both cases did look at the legislative history. The dissentsfelt that the legislative history showed that the interpretation ofthe majority was incorrect.So on the basis of what I have written there, I have said, well,sometimes legislative history helps, and I guess my instinct wouldhave been to go look at it.The other thing, which is—I understand that other people maydisagree, and all of this is very debatable—but I have said bewareof these canons. Why do I say beware? Well, the clear statementcanons have a very respectable pedigree. In countries that do nothave written constitutions, very important countries, they haveserved as protection of human liberty, because judges have some-times said in those countries: We are not going to interpret a stat-ute to infringe on a basic human liberty unless the legislature isvery clear. And that has served in those countries sometimes as asubstitute for a written constitution. We do not find that here asoften because we have a written Constitution.But the danger with the clear statement rule which I saw andwrote about is you can liferate them, as you getpinrotolifseoramteeththinegsecarluleldes,"ya°nudhaavseytoouprostatethe matter clearly if Congress wants to legislate a departure fromtraditional equity powers," I begin to think: What is this; who willknow it; how will people understand it; how will drafters knowwhat to draft; how will ordinary lawyers and those who must taketheir advice know to interpret the statute? It becomes also verycomplicated.

Well, I have argued that it is easier, simpler,more accessible; despite the fact that use of legislative history canbe abused and should not be, it is still simpler to go and look tothat in many cases where it is helpful.Now, other people present very strong arguments for the otherpoint of view, and they cannot be just dismissed, those arguments.But that is basically

NO; I know you are not. 

YOU obviously, Senator, find them difficult to reconcile

I try to resist that temptation, Senator. 

I am not certain you are asking me to guess what other people would say. 

I am not sure—you would say in one case, you are talking about a Government program; in the other case, you are talking about regulation of property. In the regulation case, the Court feels it went too far. It was like those pillars of coal, and the Court felt it went too far, and they did not show enough justification, and they felt that was important because of the underlying interest that they thought was a very important interest, and you have shown more since there was some land of possession of physical property. In the other case, they would say, well, I guess, that the impact on this, on whatever right is involved, is not as significant or is changed because of the funding nature of the program, because it was a program the Government did not have to create in the first place. Those are the lines of reasoning that it is trying to take. 

It just seems to me that I probably, if I am confirmed, will have to deal with a lot of cases that try to go into this. And they are difficult cases, and the Court disagrees about a lot of issues that come up, and you have to try to work them out and try to figure them out in light of the briefs and the arguments 

My guess is—and it is a guess—that there could arise conditions that people would argue violate a host of different amendments—fair trial—I do not know—there are lots of different parts. I think the answer is yes, but it is a guess. 

NO; I am fine. 

NO, thanks. 

Yes; you use it; you do not abuse it. 

Not discussing the merits of the case; that is, I did think that probably my instinct would have been to look at the legislative history, but I have not looked at it and do not know what I would have found. 

I have attended lectures that he has given; they are very interesting, and I think it is more. I agree with you. He has a theory

Yes. 

NO; I think that the point of the practical approach is you have instances in which the question under the establishment clause is has the Government injected religion too far into a secular institution. That is not what you are talking about now. 

YOU are talking about the other issue, which is to what extent can the Government aid a religious institution. And there, I have said several times, and I certainly think that the answer is zero. Everybody understands that the fire department will go put out the fire in the church. Everyone understands that the church will benefit in many ways from all kinds of public services. Everyone understands that the church school will. But the question becomes—and this is what I think is a practical question—when does it go too far and suddenly become what looks like the State support of one religion against another, or religion against nonreligion. If the State would support my synagogue, I might think: Fine. If they are going to support somebody else's church, I might think: Hmm. And each church might think: The other, no, but mine, yes. But we live in a society of so many different groups that it is important that those groups do not see the State as supporting the religion of another, or religion versus—I mean, that is the basic theory, and I think these are practical questions about when the age when the church is 

I would hope so. I would hope so. 

Where a clause is unclear, there is no escaping the requirement to find its meaning. The meaning, once found, might be consistent with the legislative enactment, or it might not. Obviously, in finding its meaning, a Court is also guided by the Constitution's own division of authority into three separate branches, and its understanding that legislation is given to the legislature to enact, that is, Congress.But one does have to find the meaning; otherwise, there is no way to know how to decide the case. To find the meaning, you begin with the text, but as you say, the text is very unclear in the example you are thinking of. You go back into history, and you look at what the Framers are likely to have intended. And often—or sometimes, anyway—that will not answer the question, because they may have intended the meaning to encapsulate certain important values, which values may stay the same, but the conditions in which they are applied may have changed. So you look to precedent, and you look to tradition, and you look to history if the case is really difficult. And you have to have some understanding of the practical facts of how people live. And all those are meant to be not unleashing the subjective opinion of the judge, but rather, as factors that inevitably in these tough cases, judges have to look to.

NO, you cannot just make a guess. 

YOU cannot; you cannot just make a guess, and there are certain chains, there are certain safeguards. I always think an intellectual safeguard is the safeguard of the judge thinking to himself: Remember, the decision you make has to be one that you believe other judges would also make if they understand the law and do not have your personality. And remember, too, that the decision that you make, if you are interpreting the Constitution of the United States, is a decision that Congress cannot change. So be careful of trying to remake the boat while it is in the middle of the ocean. Be careful. 

And remember, too, that 20 or 30 years from now, you had better be thinking to yourself right now that people who study this with care—and those are not necessarily scholars; that can be any man, woman, child in the United States—people who look back at this with care will think, yes, that decision interpreted the Constitution in a way that ought permanently to be the law. Those are intellectual checks that try to make the factors that I mentioned factors that do not unchain the personality of the judge, that hold the judge back from legislating, but permit the Constitution to adapt to changing circumstances in a way that I believe the Framers intended.

Yes, yes. 

I know that in most of these areas—I think what you are saying—the part that I am uncertain of—I know that when you look at the equal protection clause pure and simple, without a statute, I believe that that discriminatory intent test is the one that has been applied. I think most of these areas by Congress have been turned into statutory areas, and once you get into statutes like title VII and a number of other areas, you discover the tests, as you have tried to implement the equal protection clause, expand into disparate impact analysis as well. So I suspect that most of these cases arise in the statutory context rather than—at least racial discrimination, and much gender discrimination, too, in the area of employment practices and so forth. So I am more familiar with the statutory test. When you go back to the equal protection clause, I think there were the three tier analyses we were talking about, and that middle tier is up in the air, and I tried to answer that question yesterday. 

They said strict scrutiny, and that is a very, very difficult area, because that, very straightforward, if the area called affirmative action, and that affirmative action area is an area where the Court in a variety of ways has said affirmative action is appropriate, but you had better be certain you are remedying a real past wrong. That is necessary, in light of the real wrongs that were committed. Then when you look at that program, if you are righting a real past wrong, remember that affirmative action programs also have the ability to adversely affect people who themselves did nothing wrong, so please be certain that it is tailored carefully. Then I know the courts made distinctions between taking something away from the person who did nothing wrong, like losing a job, which they have tended to frown upon, indeed, and not giving a person something that he never had, like a promotion, and work-289 ing out what constitutes a proper tailoring in light of the possibility of hurting an innocent person, but in light of the need to correct past wrongs. That has all been considered in a group of cases which is complicated and difficult, as you can see the broad outlines, and Croson is one of those cases in which the Court has tried to decide what standard or how do we know if this is really to correct a past wrong. And in Croson they decided that they didn't think it was shown really this is necessary to carry a past wrong.That is my understanding of how it is working. 

Yes. 

Yes, I am open to that, because I think that in Justice Goldberg's concurrence, what Justice Goldberg said is that the ninth amendment is not itself a source of rights. Rather, it suggests that you shouldn't make a certain kind of argument, you shouldn't make the argument, just as you said, that the very fact that there is a Bill of Rights here with amendments listed means there aren't any others.You can't make that argument, and since you can't make the argument, I think he was addressing himself to Justice Black. Since you can't make that argument, now let's go on to see if there are others, and he found the others not really in the 9th amendment at all, but found them in the 14th and the word "liberty."

Well, it seems to me that the ninth amendment is like a rule of construction, so I don't know what it would mean to be incorporated. I don't know how that could take place. I have never thought of how that could be. It doesn't sound as if it is the kind of thing. It sounds like it is a rule of construction, basically, since I have not heard the argument to the contrary.

It said look to the 14th amendment, and the case involved the right of marital privacy.

Yes. 

He didn't say that expressly, I don't think, those words, but I think that is a fair interpretation. 

That is all right, Senator.

My view is that stare decisis is very important to the law. Obviously, you can't have a legal system that doesn't operate with a lot of weight given to stare decisis, because people build their lives, they build their lives on what they believe to be the law. And insofar as you begin to start overturning things, you upset the lives of men, women, children, people all over the country. So be careful, because people can adjust, and even when something is wrong, they can adjust to it. And once they have adjusted, be careful of fooling with their expectation. Now, that is the most general forum. . When I become a little bit more specific, it seems to me that there are identifiable factors that are pretty well established. If you, as a judge, are thinking of overturning or voting to overturn a preexisting case, what you do is ask a number of fairly specific questions. How wrong do you think that prior precedent really was as a matter of law, that is, how badly reasoned was it? You ask yourself how the law has changed since, all the adjacent laws, all the adjacent rules and regulations, does it no longer fit. You ask yourself how have the facts changed, has the world changed in very important ways. You ask yourself, insofar, irrespective of how wrong that prior decision was as a matter of reasoning, how has it worked out in practice, has it proved impossible or very difficult to administer, has it really confused matters. Finally, you look to the degree of reliance that people have had in their ordinary lives on that previous precedent. Those are the kinds of questions you ask. I think you ask those questions in relation to statutes. I think you ask those questions in relation to the Constitution. The real difference between the two areas is that Congress can correct a constitutional court, if it is a statutory question, but it can't make a correction, if it is a constitutional matter. So be pretty careful. 

Yes, that's true. It is very hard to do. 

In principle, I think the questions are the same, questions that one would ask. I think that one would recognize the difference that you just mentioned and I did about the comparative difficulties of correcting a mistake. 

Thank you. 

Yes, it is. 

Thank you. 

Yes, Senator. 

In the law, the military has always had a somewhat special role, because courts have recognized the importance of its running its own affairs, and they have recognized the importance that running their own affairs has to the well-being and the defense of the Nation. That is well-established in law; it is widely recognized, and I accept that widely recognized view.

Senator, the good reason is typically—or not always, but quite often—a question of whether the antitrust law is violated, because the antitrust law prevents some mergers, though it permits others. So I believe any such merger should be scrutinized carefully under the antitrust laws and applicable laws, and if it passes that test, it would be permitted.

Senator, if I can depart directly, from a nonlegal point of view, I have always thought that baseball was special, ever since my grandfather used to take me to Seals stadium, where we would pay 50 cents for the bleachers or $2.50 for a box seat. It seems to me that the Supreme Court

Well, I am glad you said "briefly," Senator, because briefly, I know it is an enormously complex matter. There used to be a case called Timberlane. There were conferences that were set up with the Justice Department. They would negotiate a variety of things. I can promise that in any case that raised that issue before a court that I was on, I would examine it carefully, Iwould keep an open mind, and I would look into the complexity and understand it as best I could.

The normal rule is when firms behave similarly, they are treated similarly; and where firms have an adverse impact on this country, they are treated similarly in terms of what they intend to do and what the effect is. I would start from that assumption that the law applies to both alike, but there might be special circumstances.

In summary form, I have thought that there are many instances, indeed most, where an open question in a statute is best understood through the use of legislative history. By using that history carefully and not abusing it, I think a court can better understand what the human purposes are that led Congress to enact a particular statute, and once one understands those purposes, technical matters often fall into place; you understand them better, too.There are instances where courts have used legislative history to reject absurd interpretations of statutes, to find out whether there are technical meanings, to discover whether there was some kind of drafting error, to decide whether there are special meanings of a statute that the parties and Senators wanted to use, to understand better what the purposes were. All those are instances where I think it is very appropriate. I recognize sometimes it can be abused, and it should not be.

Thank you very much, Senator. 

In looking over the act and applying it over the years, Senator, I recognize that the act is an effort to balance two separate things. One is the ordinary right of the person accused of a crime to have bail before he is actually convicted. The other is the problem that there are some defendants who might run away, and they really might; they will never be seen again. And there are others who might be particularly dangerous, and if they are out on bail, they will commit crimes. So I know that Congress tried to balance those two things in the act that you sponsored. I know it created special circumstances for dangerousness and likelihood to flee, where the person could be kept in jail without bail. We have a set of presumptions. We interpreted them in the first circuit as other circuits did, and in seeing cases come up thereafter, it seems to me that they are working reasonably well—that is, it seems to me the cases where you see the person put in prison or jail before, without bail, before trial, looking through a record, they look like people who really might run away, or they look like people who really are dangerous and would engage in other crimes, drug crimes. And I have not really seen successful appeals, or many of them, from that. So it seems to be working reasonably well on that basis. 

The first part of my answer is that particular case was, in my mind, an extremely close question as to the amount of evidence. It went back, and summary judgment was granted again; and it came back again. I do not know on those close questions; they are very difficult.The answer to your second question, the second half of your answer, is yes; I understand in that act, and also in more recently legislation, that Congress has passed important laws that recognize the importance of persons with disabilities being treated both fairly and properly, and of people making an effort to those people who do have disabilities. I understand that purpose, and I will interpret those laws with that in mind.

It is a decision, Senator, that really gave me enormous satisfaction as a person and as a judge. And the reason I felt it important both was is that you only have to look around in this country, and you see terrible social problems of poverty and discrimination, and no housing and no reading, and violence, and so forth. Everyone knows the long list of terrible problems. Then Congress does address those matters in statutes, and in this case, the statute had a very important purpose which I would describe as social justice. Then a case arose in the court of appeals, and the district court had thought that a series of very complicated technical doctrines prevented the district court from carrying out that purpose in this instance. So it was a case where I felt knowledge of the technical part of the law helped the court and helped me analyze those technical doctrines fairly, with an idea of what they had in mind, and enabled us, I think, to cut through the technical doctrines, to show to the district court that they were not the obstacle that the districtcourt had thought and that the technical doctrines permitted the district court to get to the heart of the matter, which was discrimination in housing, and to create appropriate relief.So I felt that it was an instance where knowing the technical doctrine, using it, understanding it, allowed the possibility of removing it as an obstacle to the social justice that the basic statute passed by Congress aimed at.

Thank you very much. 

That is very complimentary. 

NO, because I am trying to decide in the—generally speaking, I think affirmative action means you make an enormous effort, you make a really serious effort. A quota is an absolute number that you have to meet. Affirmative action means you take this seriously and you really look. That is the general accepted version I think in a lay person's terms.301 

Then you are on the edge. I mean as I understand it—and I am not saying how you would measure a person's real effort—internally, internally, when a person makes an affirmative action effort, it means what it says. It means you really look, you really understand the situation. You understand that a lot of people haven't had the opportunities that other people have had. You think to yourself, why aren't there the persons of this race or whatever, why. Remember why. Remember the history. And then taking all that into account, remembering the history, remembering the discrimination that may exist, remembering that some people have a lot less opportunity than others, then you go out and look and say I'm going to find these people who may not have thought of coming, and you really try very, very hard, and that is subjective. It might fail, but if it does fail, you better be able to tell yourself that you really looked very, very hard. A lot of that is subjective, but that is the subjective difference that I think of in my own mind. 

What has happened I think, Senator, in the affirmative action cases legally in the Supreme Court is that the Supreme Court basically has recognized two things. The first thing that it has recognized is that there are injustices that need remedying, and those injustices stem from that long history, and the long history before the 14th amendment and the long history after the 14th amendment, where the injustice was perpetuated. So they begin with the first point, which is we have to see a need rooted in that history of past discrimination. And the second point is, once the first point is there, once we see that need, then the program has to be carefully tailored. Why carefully tailored? Because it is quite clear that an affirmative action program seeking to remedy past injustice can in fact adversely affect other people who themselves did not discriminate. Of course, those people are upset and, therefore, you can absolutely understand that. Now, looking into the way in which those two problems are to be balanced, it seems to me that the Supreme Court has looked at a number of individual factors and they have distinguished, for example, in terms of that other third person, between taking away from that person what he or she already have, like a job, or not giving to that person something he or she did not ever have, like a promotion. And while there is a problem in both cases, the second is a little bit less harmful than the first. And they have looked at how long the program will last, and they have looked at how tai-lored it is to the problem, and they have looked at is it going to expire, is it coming along well.It seems to me there are a number of factors they have looked at, as they have tried both to remedy and to balance, in order not to work too much harm to others.

If you go beyond 

If you go beyond those cases you know where the Supreme Court has spelled out what is permissible in terms of these two sets of factors, and you were to pass a law doing something like a quota, is that what you are thinking of? 

YOU don't have one. 

Assuming it is taken off the books, then there are still cases like Weber, for example, where the Supreme Court will permit employers to adopt these programs to remedy past discrimination. There are cases like Bakke, where the Supreme Court has said, you know, that universities can do it. So there are circumstances, and indeed courts can as part of a remedy. 

Well, if it is a court case, I suppose that there are now standards, which I am not totally familiar with, frankly, which the Supreme Court has tried to promulgate in a number of cases, saying, well, it is time and the problem is over in the school area, for example. I haven't looked at those, but if it arises in the court case, in the court circumstance, I suppose the court, when faced with a challenge, would look to see if this is still really necessary or not. Suppose it has been complied with. Suppose it has been met. I suppose that is a judgment that a court would make, but it has to be careful. 

It isn't, if it is following the legal standard. But one has to be careful. 

The answer in my mind is, of course, it is different, but that is a difference that courts should take into account, and it doesn't make it useless.Suppose, for example, you, after the Senators are all thinking about a bankruptcy law, it is easiest with a law that isn't too controversial, and you all get together and all the Senators who are working on this bill work out a set of words that is going to distinguish which kind of cases can be brought by consent before the bankruptcy judge and which cases there is a right to bring before the bankruptcy judge even without consent. That is awfully technical, and the words that describe that are pretty technical, too, and they can refer to another case in the Supreme Court which is filled with technicality.Well, might or you might read that statute and read those technical words that everybody really agrees to as a matter of policy, because you have thought about it as a matter of policy. Yet, one might still scratch his head and be puzzled. And if you have decided to help by putting a statement in the record, even though it came after the debate was over, that is something a court might look to and lawyers might look to for enlightenment, because it might be apparent that there is no policy disagreement among you or your colleagues about what you are trying to do. But it is important to explain what you are trying to do.That is why I say it depends. If there is a huge disagreement, beware of that later admitted statement. If it is simply a kind of explanation, it can help guide.

Yes. 

They did. 

I don't think so, actually. I understand that legislative history can point in different directions and I understand it can be complicated and confused, but I think it is worth trying. I think it is like you do your best, you do your best. You look at it, you try to draw information from it, you try to help understand the human purpose. People can still disagree about it and it isn't always done properly, but I think it is worth trying. 

Yes.

What I have said on this publicly really are two things. One is in response to your question directly. Of course, it is difficult in instances, but there are instances where it isn't difficult. And like many matters of law in tough areas, you can say, all right, I understand that there are difficult borderline calls, but that doesn't mean stay away from the main thing which isn't so difficult. So there will be some that are difficult and some that are not. The not is not. In other words, there are many cases where it isn't too hard to figure out.The other thing which you point out is, of course, from a first amendment point of view, it is easier, if you are enhancing the penalty of conduct, it is already illegal, than if you do get right into an area where there isn't such conduct and only expression. That thought doesn't decide cases, but, nonetheless, the actual decisions I am sure will come up again and again. I know that RAV is a very controversial case.

Yes. 

NO, I think we followed all the rules. 

The bathrooms, it is a general rule that a judge does have a bathroom in his chambers, and there are a lot of people working there and 

I think there is room for somewhere close to 30, and there is the U.S. attorney, and there are a number of others. Whatever the normal rules were, we followed them. In respect to the law libraries, I feel that it is very important that each judge has a library, and that library should be close. A law book is to a judge what a scalpel is to a surgeon, and you don't want the judge very far from the book, because maybe the judge won't look into the book, and nobody wants that. So it is normal that books are near judges, and I think that is proper.The kitchens consist of a small area where a judge, at his own expense, not government expense, can go and buy a small refrigerator and bring in a little microwave, which he would purchase, in order to have lunch, say, with his clerks or the other people in the chambers.

I think Senator DeConcini gave the cost yesterday. I think it is 750,000 square-feet. It is a big building, and I think the cost, with land purchase and everything, was around $218 million or somewhere around there.

Thank you, Senator. The response is three. The first is you put in half, I think, when you say too far; and the other half is too little. The problem that the book is aimed at is spending a lot of money over here to save a statistical life that may not even exist, at the same time that there are women with breast cancer who would live, but who do not because they cannot afford or find the place for the mammograms; and there are children who do not have the vaccines that will save them from death for a lot of diseases. And I think there are two pages in that book that summarize, one sentence after another, all those things that might be done but that are not done. So the book is a plea—though it is put in technical terms—it is put in a plea not to cut back by 1 penny this Nation's commitment to health, safety, and the environment. But please, let us think about the possibility of reorganizing that commitment so that there are fewer women and children who are dying of things they really will die of because the money was not there, when there are moneys being spent on the statistical life that might not exist. That is the first point. The second point is there is a plan there for reorganization. The point about the reorganization is not really to create a new bureaucracy that will take power from the people. Rather, the people have delegated already to the bureaucracy power to do particular things. And there, it seems to me wise, or at least I suggest it, that the people who are already there—in, let us say, parts of the Office of Management and Budget—not be trained solely as cost-cutters, not be trained solely as people who do policy analysis, but perhaps take on a career where they learn what really goes on at EPA for part of their career; where they come over to Congress and work for a while and learn something about that; where they go out into the field and maybe learn what people are really thinking, and then come back and have, with that experience, more ability to transfer resources from one program to another that a pure costcutter might lack. And the third problem, which is a real problem for democracy and is a tremendous problem for you and a tremendous problem for me, is I think I have a guess of what people want in that area, and may guess is that what they want is more life saved. And my guess is that is what you want, too. So a lot of what I have written about in that book is should statutes try to do that, or should they go into such detail as dioxinFO20 to the 14th degree in three molecules, et cetera. That is the problem of delegation. That is the question of what level of specificity do you delegate. I absolutely think that people want more safety, and that is the basic power that should be delegated. I think it becomes very, very, very difficult to expect people to become experts on risk analysis, or how many molecules there ought to be in what kind of sub-stance. And that is the kind of concern that I am worried about that leads me to think there are ways of organizing the bureaucracy better to save more human life, with the same commitment of resource that we now have.

Yes. 

Right. 

And this, you might say is Utopian, I know. But you realize what it is I think the public is informed about. I do not think they are not informed about what they want. I do not think they are not informed about there being a problem. I think they do know what they want, and I think the public does know that there is a problem. And I think they are right. What is very hard to get public consensus about is the right number of molecules, or the right chemical substance exactly where. That is the problem of information. And what is perhaps a little Utopian, I would call the biggest problem that I find from a policy point of view—the problem of building trust in the Government. And my suggestion there has been a little bit like this: Suppose the President of the United States—this is what I have said before—had somewhat broader authority to take money or resources from one program and to move it to another, and that he was under a mandate to meet the following condition—come back and prove to us that in doing so, you have saved more human life. And suppose that began to be done. Then, you might gradually— you might gradually—build public trust in that kind of circulating career path where people come to Congress and EPA and OMB and create this institution, and people in the country begin to understand that more life is being saved, a little at a time. You might gradually build some confidence in that institution, hard though it is to break into a mode of public trust. And if you could do that, you would end up saving more life, and that is the thrust of the book. 

Absolutely. 

Absolutely.310 

Senator, I looked at this very carefully. There was no party that I had invested in in the case. It had been fully disclosed. The issue to me, and I think the issue under the canons, is whether there would flow from that investment a substantial effect on my investment from that decision in that case. That is not a speculative effect, it is not a remote effect, it is not a contingent effect. It is a real, substantial effect. And having looked at that case before and looked at it again, it seems to me that it was correct under the canons that I could sit in that case. I do think that, though I understand in fact the various problems you have raised. 

What he said was imprudent, Senator, he believes that it is ethical, that no ethical canon was violated, and he is concerned—and I have since read this—whether or not it is prudent for a judge to have an investment in an insurance company. And haying listened to your concerns, which I realize were in very good faith and were very, very important to address thoroughly, I have come to the conclusion that it would be best not to have such an investment, and that is a matter of prudence; it is not a matter of ethics. But having listened to that, that is how I feel about it.

I think that I must have a very, very careful system to achieve the very objective you are announcing and enunciating and I have listened to. What I think that system is is that it must be absolutely disclosed fully, in whatever court I am in, just what that investment is, and indeed, the parties have to be directed, their attention directed to it, and the parties have to be able to—anonymously, so I do not know which party—either orally or in writing, point out how there might be a real impact on that investment from a holding in the case. And then I think that must be communicated to me in a way that I do not know which party raised the issue, and I must evaluate that with great care and then, having done so, if I come to the conclusion that there would be a direct, a real impact on my investment, then I recuse myself.

That is right. 

Yes. 

The question, from my point of view, is was there a real, direct impact on the investment. And I think the question of whether there is a real, direct impact on the investment by those who have looked at it—the answer is no. And I think that what I would like to do in the future is to look to see, after having been advised by the parties or anyone who wants to, is there a real impact on the investment from the holding in the case. 

If I thought there were a substantial, that is, a direct, effect, I would have taken myself out, and that would be the correct thing to do. If, judgmentally, I think that the effect is remote or speculative or contingent, then I think the thing to do is to sit. And in making my judgment on that case, I concluded that any effect on my investment was remote or speculative or contingent, not substantial, not direct. I think that was a correct judgment. What I am trying to do is, in the future, make certain that I am fully informed so I can make similar judgments with complete information, with the parties fully understanding the problems, the likelihoods. 

That is correct. 

I could not find a way. I think it does not. I think it does not. And I suppose there are people who have thought of some way, but I think any way people might think of would be speculative. I personally cannot think of a real way. 

I did not see it that way, Senator. I thought that the case involved fact-related matters growing out of a particular waste dump, and I think those fact-related matters were viewed under the standard of whether the district court was clearly erroneous.It is very difficult for an appellant to get an appeals court with a 40,000-page record on a fact-related matter to achieve a reversal under a clearly erroneous standard. EPA did, indeed, achieve such a reversal on one of the matters before us. We decided in favor of the EPA on one of those fact-related points, and we decided on the other fact-related points that the district court's decision was not clearly erroneous.That is basically, in my mind, what was at issue in that case in the area you are talking about.

Yes. 

On the issue of volatile organic compounds, one of the fact-related issues, after reading through many thousands of pages, we all came to the conclusion that the district court was wrong, and we supported EPA and sent it back for more thorough cleanup on that point. On the other fact-related points, we decided there was enough evidence to support the district court.Quite honestly, when I finished, I thought maybe EPA has won on this aspect of the case, because it is very difficult to achieve a reversal on that fact-related type of issue. It won some, the important one of VOC. It lost others. I thought the whole matter is factrelated, fact-specific. I went through it conscientiously, reading thousands of pages of records. And on the basis of those thousands of pages, I came and my colleagues came to the fact-related conclusions that we wrote in the opinion.

From my appearance of reading the records, Senator, the area was the way I described it, and there was—but the point that I want to make is what I have written in the book and the decision in the case are two totally separate things. I have gone in my mind, thinking that case is decided as a judge. It is decided, recognizing as I wrote that when the EPA decides something in an administrative context rather than coming into a case in court, all presumptions are for the EPA. It did appear in a book written on a policy basis, having nothing to do with my role as a judge, pointing out a variety of things that I have tried to point out, for other315 people—environmentalists and many others—to read and to accept or to reject as they wish.My object, purely as a person who is interested in public policy, was to write matters down so that other people could consider them, question them, criticize them, say they are absolutely wrong. That is fine with me. I like that. I think that is important to get that kind of criticism as a policymaker, and, indeed, to get it as a judge as well.But I want to be very, very clear that that book does not have to do with my role as a judge.

I do, rather. That is to say, I do not know if you are speaking theoretically or practically.When I went into Lloyd's, I viewed it as a very conservative investment in which, in fact, you are exposed to insurance companies that sell and insure and buy anything in the world. And all these things over time, whether there are earthquakes in Japan or whether there are tidal waves or whether there is maritime losses or these kind of loses—there can be losses in everything, anything. You never know what your own syndicate may be winning, may be losing, whatever it is. It is done in a conservative way so that whether a particular case there is a loss or does not balances out somewhere else, and you do not know.Now, as a practical matter and as a theoretical matter, as a practical matter I believed and I still believe that my risks and benefits would consist of several thousand dollars in income each year, and sometimes several thousand dollars—by that I mean under $10,000 or $12,000 certainly, possibly having to write a check. There was a deposit at Lloyd's that possibly was meant for the worst case that went up to about $150,000.Theoretically—theoretically—if worse had come to worse, and it was stressed to me at the time that over 300 years in conservative syndicates, worse did not come to worse. But if worse came to worse, luckily because I am in a very fortunate economic situation, about 20 percent to 25 percent of our family assets would have been lost. That is the worse, theoretically, coming to worse.316 

It would have been an awful lot of money. It depended on the year. It depended on the year. 

We are talking about several hundred thousand dollars. 

I do not think it could have gone that high, but it is possible. 

Senator, what I do if I have a lot of money at stake or if I have a little money at stake, if there is a big investment or if there is a small investment, it is the same question. The question is: Look at those cases, see if there is anyone from the investment that is a party in that case. If so, you are out of it. If not, look again. Look again at that case to see if the decision in that case could substantially affect your pocketbook. If so, you are out of it. If not, fine. I apply that test with alarm bells to whatever investment I have, big or small. And in that case, no alarm bell went off, and the reason that no alarm bell went off is I thought judgmentally that there was no substantial effect on a small investment, on a big investment, on a medium-sized investment, on any investment. And I think that that conclusion has been verified by others. 

What I must do as a judge is I must make up my own mind on a case-by-case basis whether there is a substantial impact or whether there is not. 

Yes, Senator. I have taken into account your concern, and I understand the concern, and I think it is extremely important that people have confidence in the integrity and that there is absolutely no conflict in such circumstances. What I intend to do, as I said, is that whatever investment I have in this area in whatever court I am in will be posted clearly, all information given, with the clerk of court. The parties in every case will be directed to that so they will find it and know what it says. They will be told that, anonymously—anonymously—they may write out or tell orally to the clerk any way in which they see that the holding in this case could really affect that investment.Then the clerk would or an appropriate person would communicate that to me anonymously. I would consider very carefully, in light of what you and others have said, whether in any case there would be really an impact on the investment from the holding of that case. And should I conclude there would be, I would recuse myself.

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator. 

The short answer, Senator, is it would depend upon the provision and it would depend upon the statute. You have raised the question about whether those words "subject to the jurisdiction thereof are meant to exclude only a few people, such asdiplomats' children and some others, or whether Congress can control that definition by statute.I understand the question, and I am absolutely certain if legislation of that sort is enacted, court challenge will follow immediately. And, therefore, we would consider that—I would have to if I was on the Court—in the context of litigation, get the briefs, get the arguments, and think hard about it.

The reason that I say I think it depends is because I know there are legal arguments about the extent to which section 2, I guess, or section 5 of the 14th amendment does or does not allow Congress to do or say certain things in statutes.So, not having gone into it thoroughly, I suspect it depends upon the particular statute and the particular provision. Always there will be a question with any statute and any provision: If there is an area of ambiguity, does that particular statute nonetheless fall outside of it? So those are the kinds of questions that would arise.

Yes, they will. 

That is right. 

That is exactly right. 

In general, though not in detail, I think it fair to start from the proposition, it is true, religion is extremely important to all of us. Even if we have different religions, we share the fact that it is important. And from a constitutional point of view, it is there protected in the first amendment because the Founders recognized the importance of religion and the importance of allowing people freely to exercise their religion. They had learnedthrough experience. That experience came from the religious wars of the 17th century. They put that in the Constitution to be absolutely certain that that free exercise was protected.In my own view, if someone or a State or someone tried to prevent people from teaching their religion to their children or practicing a home school that was based on that kind of thing, very serious constitutional questions would arise. They would have to be decided in the context of the case. But on their face, it would be a very serious problem.

It is designed to protect the right of the parents to pass along to their children their religion and to protect that from State interference. 

I think those home schools based on that principle follow from that, and that is why I say somebody who tried to prevent that legally would suddenly face very, very serious constitutional challenges. 

NO, I understand this is an area—how the first amendment is applied in this area is a matter of great contention legally. But I do not think it is contentious, and I think the vast majority of people, I think there is a kind of consensus that that first amendment—it is not my opinion. I think there is a consensus opinion that that first amendment protects the right of people to pass their religion on to their children, and the home school situation on its face seems to fall within that. Therefore, I think there is a consensus. Not my personal opinion but a consensus that some protection is offered there.

It is certainly true, Senator, that Congress gets advice from all kinds of people, everybody in the country, including judges, including policymakers, including dozens of others, and it is up to Congress to decide, the legislature, what to do. So, therefore, I would stick to a historical example. The one that most obviously comes to mind is: Wouldn't it have been a wonderful thing, in my mind, if sometime around the year 1870, 1880, 1885, 1890, any time before 1954, that Congress had decided to enact laws that made that promise of fairness in the 14th amendment a real thing? How wonderful that would have been. And yet there was not that law.I think in 1954 the Court said that promise will be made a reality, and it has been a very difficult thing, but an ultimately critical thing, that that become real. I can hardly think of all our country's problems—and there are so many, whether you start with violence, or hunger, or children, or reading, or anything. Right there at the top of that list is the need to make that promise a reality. And that is hard.So I think the courts began that in 1954, and I know Congress has stepped in, and I just wish, wouldn't it have been wonderful if that had been done earlier.

YOU are asking me if I can think quickly of a distinction, and obviously I cannot. But, nonetheless, I think what is important, which is what I have tried to do, is to expose to you how I might go about thinking and dealing with a problem.What the basic view is, how I see things basically, the reason, as I see it, for hesitating to go into—there are three, really—to go into something that is going to be a specific case, the best reason, which is usually the true reason, is that I have not thought about it in that kind of depth, and I should not go say something that I have not thought about that is likely to come up in the context of a particular case. That is always true.A second reason is, even if you think you have thought about it, how often it really is true that I think I know something, I think I have thought it through, and then a real case comes along— maybe it is like a vote. I do not know if it is or not, but suddenly it is real. Suddenly you really know that people's lives turn on it. And that produces a tremendous degree of concentration that might previously have been lacking.You read the briefs, and you understand the full facts, and that is not true in a context before it becomes real. And of course, the third reason is that you want to impress upon people that you will be fair and openminded in a particular case, and decide on the basis of briefs and arguments and thought at the time.

Yes; there are many, many ways of interacting. In my career, I have written quite a lot, and I have gone to bar meetings, and I have gone around and talked to people. It is not secret. It is not—there should be this interaction, and trying to work out how you do the interaction, what is going to far, what you can say, what precisely the boundaries are in terms of policy issues relating to courts, and all the different things I might have taught about or whatever—that is difficult. There are no easy answers to those things, but the need to get out and communicate, I have always felt strongly; I have tried to build a career that reflects that. I do not guarantee I have always drawn the line correct, but that

Yes, I do. 

Every instinct I have cuts in that direction. 

I will be careful. I would be careful if I am confirmed. 

I certainly hope so. 

The ninth amendment, to Justice Goldberg, and I think to many others, makes clear that fact that certain rights are listed does not mean there are not others. Then the 14th amendment takes the word "liberty," and the question that you ask is, well, if there are others, how do we know what they are. 

And what you have suggested is of course, you start with the text, and then you look back to history, and you look back to what the Framers thought. But so often, you cannot—what the Framers thought is that the Constitution should adapt, preserving certain basic values. So, what are those values? And we are back to where we started with a historic approach. We are back to where we started. I think the word "dignity" is important. At the most basic level, the Preamble to the Constitution lists what the Framers were up to—establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. Liberties are then listed, some, and underlying things like free speech and free religion, as I described or discussed when I talked about my own family, listening, is an idea, in my mind, of dignity.356 Freedom from search, unreasonable search, unreasonable seizures, rights to fair trial, rights to speak and discuss, rights to express oneself creatively, rights to practice one's own religion without interference—all of those things have something to do with an individual, a man, a woman, a family, being able to lead a certain kind of life, to have a story to their life that is a story of a dignified life. That means many decisions must be up to them, and not to be told to them by the State. That, too, is why the Constitution, in my opinion, originally started out as a Government—and remains—of limited power.Now, you reserve the area of autonomy. You look back into history. You try to determine what are the basic values that underlay those things that are enumerated, and that gives you a key to other basic values. You look to what Frankfurter and Harlan and Goldberg and others talked about as the traditions of our people, always trying to understand what people historically have viewed as traditional, and the values being there, you look to history in the past, to history in the present, and to the meaning, to what life is like today, to try to work out how—maybe an idea a little bit into the future, too—to get an idea of what are those things that are fundamental to a life of dignity.I know those are very general statements, but in working that out with precedents and working that out in the context of the Constitution, you look and see what judges have tried to do, and you try to behave in that particular way.

Yes. 

I do not think the values are different. I think how they might apply might be. 

That, of course, is true. But what I think in my own mind in respect to that particular opinion, Brown, surely, every time I think about it—and you go back to the pre-Brownworld—you can ask yourself how could people have looked at that promise, which is a promise of fairness, and think of the dignity that underlies so many of the first 10 amendments, and say we have it? They did not have it. It seems so obvious that that was not there that I think of Brown as an instance of applying law that was there, that was clear—a promise of fairness to circumstances where the fairness did not exist.And perhaps it is hindsight, but I would like to think that if I had been there before, it would have been foresight. And I understand that judges, like any human beings, can make mistakes and get things wrong, but you would like to think that if you are getting things right, you are referring back to the basic idea of values that reflect human dignity, that underlie the Constitution because they are necessary to assure the promise of the Preamble.

That is true. 

Thank you.[Response of Judge Breyer and the prepared statement of Senator Leahy follow:]JUDGE BREYER'S RESPONSE TO SENATOR LEAHY'S QUESTIONLEADING CASESIn response to Senator Leahy's request that I identify Supreme Court cases of particular importance decided since I graduated from law school, I am providing the following list of decisions, the importance and wisdom of which are, in my judgment, widely accepted.1. Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964). This case redeemed the promise of our democratic form of government by ensuring an equal vote for every citizen.2. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). While the exact contours of the right against self-incrimination remain a subject of debate, Miranda established the basic proposition that the Fifth Amendment would prevent the most serious abuses of official power.3. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969). By reinvigorating the clear and present danger test in a case involving the Ku Klux Klan, this decision affirmed the fundamental principle that the First Amendment must protect even the speech we hate.4. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973), and Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976). These cases established the critical principle that the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantees extend to gender discrimination.5. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 714 (1989). This decision is important not so much for its specific subject matter (the Sentencing Commission) but more generally because it reintroduced needed flexibility into the constitutional separationof-powers analysis, ensuring that Congress and the President can meet new challenges to effective governance posed by complex modern problems.PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEAHYMr. Chairman, I conclude my round of questioning with these observations: I want to commend my colleagues for their thoughtful participation in these most important proceedings and to commend Judge Breyer for the way he has conducted himself and his willingness to reveal something of himself and his thinking.Quite frankly, I would have liked him to be even more forthcoming and specific in his responses, but I acknowledge that the appropriate line is difficult to draw and recognize that my frustration may reflect my own perspective as a Senator asking questions.I have sensed through the course of these proceedings a disappointment among some that there has not been more controversy surrounding this nomination, that we have not had to endure a donnybrook or witness a wealth of political maneuvering. I suggest, to the contrary, that we should take pride in what is transpiring here: This is an occasion when all three branches of our Federal Government can be seen working together smoothly and efficiently.I hope that the members of the public who have had an opportunity to join us over the last few days either in person or to witness these proceedings on television have taken something positive from them. I again commend President Clinton for having chosen a nominee who can bring people of diverse political views together and who has engendered such praise as an excellent choice.Finally, if I might, I say to you, Judge Breyer, that after you are confirmed I hope that you will successfully resist the pressures to become cloistered away from the world. I think that your involvement with your family, demonstrated throughout these hearings, provides some protection for you. I doubt that your active wife and children are going to allow you to lose touch.In your opening statement and your answers over these last three days you have indicated your intention always to remember the effects that your decisions will have on real people—people who may not be powerful or well-connected. You have demonstrated that you have not only mastered the complexities of the law but are the fulfillment of your parents' influences toward public service and to awareness of the impact your work will have on the lives of others.So I urge you even while sitting on the High Court to be of the world. I do not suggest that you tailor your opinions to the winds of public opinion. Rather, I urge you to remember that you have learned about government and people. I call upon you to fulfill the promise you made to the American people as these proceedings began—to remember that the decisions you help to make will have an enormous effect upon the lives of many, many Americans and to do your utmost to see thatthose decisions reflect both the letter and the spirit of law that is meant to help them.[Recess.] 

A difficult case. I think that if in fact I could have read the statute, "three prior convictions," to mean what you say— three prior convictions—the case would have been much easier.The problem in the case arose from the fact that you could not read it that way because the Supreme Court had said at least some of those things that say convictions are not convictions.They had said, for example, that one of those previous convictions was a conviction that was obtained without the person having a lawyer; then, it is not a conviction, even though it says "conviction."So the dilemma—and this is why it was so very difficult—is it assumed by everybody, everybody agrees, that you cannot just read "conviction" to mean conviction. Certain ones do not count. Those without a lawyer, for example, do not count. And now the question is are there some other ones that do not count. And the simplest thing seemed to me to be to say those that are unconstitutional do not count, because if you do not do it that way, you would have to say there are some unconstitutional convictions which are convictions, and there are other unconstitutional convictions—those without a lawyer—which are not convictions. And I did not understand how to draw that distinction.On the other side of it was if you take the approach I just said, won't it become very, very difficult for judges to work at sentencing hearings? Won't people challenge it all the time? And what you have in so many of these cases which was present there is you have some very strong policy reasons, which policy reasons are a key to try to understand how Congress would have wanted a statute interpreted where the language cannot be read literally, and where there is no legislative history. And where there is not, I am trying to put myself in the shoes of a person in Congress who has an objective, who is faced with the same kind of interpretive difficulties that I would be faced with.The Supreme Court went along with the opposite approach, I guess, which is that it is better to say there are different kinds of unconstitutional convictions, and some of them count, and some of them do not count. That is a reasonable view, too, and I did decide it the other way, and they are authoritative.But I do not think one view or the other is more or less a departure from the statute. I think in both instances, what you are trying to do is interpret a statute in conditions where it cannot be read just literally because of the circumstance I mentioned.

It would have had to come out the other way, in my opinion. I know there are some distinctions. We actually—the decision in Paleo was a very close, very difficult decision that we debated quite a lot, and I do not like to give a legal opinion, and so you are getting an off-the-cuff response to the Supreme Court, putting myself back, and most of the lawyers, I think, and the judges in our circuit would say that the recent Supreme Court opinion suggests it should have come out the other way. I do not make that statement definitely, but361 

I think that is all there, Senator, and I think that what I am trying to do and I think most of us in the judiciary would try to do is to try to work out what the intention of the Congress is. The question that was a stumbling block for me and is in the Supreme Court opinion that you read is, well, prior precedent of the Supreme Court—which, by the way, they are free to modify or interpret. We are not free to modify or interpret. Prior precedent of the Supreme Court said that the defendant could challenge some prior convictions; for example, convictions that were obtained without a lawyer. That being so, what is the rule as to when a prior conviction could be challenged and when it could not? Are there different categories of constitutional violation? Are some more important than others? I cannot answer that question as a lower court judge. Looking at precedent when I looked at it, I found that there, and whether I was right or wrong, I thought that was a major stumbling block to the interpretation that the later court came up with. That was my thinking at the time, and that is what I tried to express in that opinion. 

Yes, exactly. Exactly. 

Exactly; and the Court, the Supreme Court has the power to say, look, there are differences in a conviction being unconstitutional because the person did not have a lawyer and a conviction being unconstitutional because he did have a lawyer and the lawyer acted ineffectively. The Supreme Court has the power to say those are two different things. As I interpreted it at the time, I did not see how to say that they were two different things, that they were different kinds of constitutional violation. I recognize the argument. You had to do it one way or the other. You had to say there are different kinds, or you had to create the procedural problem. And I thought more closely—to the intent of Congress was the way I decided it, and the Supreme Court said later, no, it was the other way.

There are areas, vast areas, as I really said yesterday and the day before and would say the same tomorrow and every other day, that there are vast areas where it is obvious that churches receive assistance from the Government. The area of social services, the area of fire departments is the obvious example I use, but there are many others. And there are tax exemptions— tax exemptions aimed at religious institutions. And there are various busing, as in the opinion that you read. And the difficult question, when you say neutrality, of course, immediately that is fine. In the context of any individual program, what happens when there is a challenge in court is someone says, yes, we understand that; yes, you are absolutely right. But this particular one goes too far.Then what you have in a court case is the issue about whether this is or is not going too far. And what I can say is I consider those open-mindedly. You understand from my opinions in this area that I have a practical bent of mind to see if it really is going too far, not some theory, and that I will try to decide those cases in that light.

It sounds to me most of these cases that have come along have been involved in line-drawing, and is it really going too far up here, or is it not quite far enough? Is this too far or isn't it? That is my impression of most of what comes up in recent years in this area.I cannot promise there will not be major cases that come up. Obviously, there may be.

It is interesting. Of course, I am not a trial judge, but I talk to trial judges. And what is interesting to me when I talk to trial judges is the enormous faith that they have in the jury system. And again and again they will say, particularly in criminal trials—it is very interesting because at lunch we discuss this every so often. And in the district court in Massachusetts, the judges that I usually have lunch with, you know, quite often, they say it works. It works, again and again. And I do not promise you—and no one would—that it always works, that it works perfectly. But you do discover a tremendous sincere belief on the part of judges over and over in the value of the that system, that it does basically work pretty well. The jurors are admirable in contributing that time and effort.So I know that people, thoughtful people like you and me, I hope, and many, many others, are concerned with the way in which the right to fair trials interacts with the free press right. But the basic idea of the jury and the way it is working, my sense is among people who deal with it, they think it works.

Of course, I agree that the trust problem is amazing. It is an amazingly big problem for institutions.In the particular area that you are talking about, what I have said publicly—I hope it is not overly optimistic; many would think it is—is that not all the solutions are legislative; that if, in fact, you get members of the bar who are interested in criminal defense work as well as those interested in prosecutions, and members of the press, and they get a sense of what each other's problems and responsibilities and so forth are, very often some of the things that you are concerned about that interfere with fair trials or whatever can be ironed out outside of the legal system, outside of laws and legislation, from people simply understanding the institutional problems of the other.That is the kind of thing I have talked about. I think it is still possible.

Publicly. 

Yes. 

I hope so. We so see ourselves in our own institutions. I so much see myself as a judge, and we become so narrow, in a sense, not understanding not just the other person's point of view but the institution in which they are working. I think that is true of press and judges and everyone else. And conversation in an effort to see the different perspective, that is what I have said publicly.I have tried to encourage that, and I would try to encourage it still.

The approach of that report—I am not saying that I agree with everything in that report, but the approach of that report is an approach that I would call disclosure, and what I would think would be clear to the public anyway. The Administrative Law Section of the American Bar Association has taken thepositions that are controversial that you describe, and I think it should be apparent through ABA policy that they are not speaking for judges when they talk about something controversial that judges have no business talking about.And in the Administrative Law Section, should something have come up that I thought was something I should not express my view upon as a judge, I would just say so, if it was not apparent to everybody from the situation that that was the case.I would not like to see membership in that association by judges discouraged. I do think it is so terribly important for judges to be associated with members of the bar and to be able to have forums where they can discuss problems of judging, the institution of judging, problems of the bar, problems of the litigants that lead to the bar, having clients. All these matters are terribly important, in my opinion, to discuss outside the pure ivory tower of the judiciary.And I see the American Bar Association as offering forums where those kinds of discussions are encouraged and appropriate, and I favor that.

There are things that come up. I think that 

Yes, on the ABA, there would be in the council in the Administrative Law Section, things would come up and I would just say this, of course, doesn't include me. I can't pinpoint it, but I do have a distinct recollection there have been such instances. 

I know your general statement that a child is different and in need of greater protection is correct, it is an important interest. There are circumstances in which curfews, I am sure, are normal in various circumstances in which they have been upheld.The constitutional argument which you say is being made means that I have to be cautious, because I would absolutely want to approach that with an open mind, and so it is hard for me to go further into that. The interests that you identify, I am absolutely certain are there. In other words, I can't easily discuss this, as you say, which is totally true, that it is likely to be the subject of a case.

That, Senator, was a brief article years and years ago. I think it was written at a time—I don't know much about genetic engineering now, and I can say I knew less then—it was as time when people didn't know a lot about it. And I think the thrust of that was get to the scientists and find out what is really happening before you enact specific legislation. I think that was the thrust of the article. I think since that time there have been programs in the legislatures, in statutes. I think that the executive branch has acted in369 a variety of ways to try to assure adequate protection in that area, like others.

NO; it would depend on what it was. The ethical issues are very, very important, very important. If I am remembering correctly, one way in which some of those issues—I think Professor Freund wrote an article suggesting you try to get members of the community—doctors, ministers, and others—into groups that can jointly work out the way of dealing with some of these implications and problems. That kind of approach, too, not necessarily the only approach, but that can be a possible approach.

I hope not. I hope what I am doing is using the technical part to try to uncover the human purpose that we are trying to help. Airline, et cetera, that was technical, you can say, but they are real human beings who couldn't afford to fly, and those real human beings have benefited, if it is a lower electricity rate, it is a lower air fare. All these technical things have to do with real people and may affect their lives a lot.I plead guilty to a dry style of writing. That is to say when I wrote this book on regulation, the object of which, of course, was to produce a style of regulation that would be effective and that would help people. The Los Angeles Times, in reviewing that, said—I don't know how the Los Angeles Times was reviewing a technical book, but they did, and they said, well, Alice, when she emerged from the pool of tears in "Alice in Wonderland," turned to the door mouse, who was reading Hume's "History of England." "Why are you reading that," said Alice. "We are all wet," said the door mouse, "and this is the driest thing I know." That was before, said the Times, Judge Breyer wrote this book. [Laughter.]Now, I plead guilty to that, but the purpose is a human purpose. 

This is an area that you have thought about a great deal, I think, from reading what the commissions have beenthat you have been on and your own experience. There are a limited number of alternatives, and eventually, I guess—you know the door-closing approach doesn't work very well. The reorganizing having more and more appellate judges has its problems. I sometimes describe that as judges can cause confusion, as well as enlightenment, and there are limitations on size and numbers at the appellate level, certainly.The commissions have recommended, at least for future study, the possibility of additional tiers in the Federal system. Without advocating an approach, I think that eventually Congress and others like you yourself who are interested in these problems will begin to look at restructuring. That may happen. It may happen in 10 years, it may happen in 30, it may wait and see what happens to the growth.The ultimate problem is delivering justice to people who have problems. That is the basic bottom line. If it keeps growing and growing, somehow, without depriving the public of justice, you have to work out the effective way of doing it, and that could involve restructuring at some point.

I don't have better than you have, the ADR, et cetera. There are human beings in the world. Those human beings have problems. They get into disputes. Really, I think what they are interested in, those people, are two things, to get the problem resolved and to get it resolved fairly.Now, ADR, mediation, all those things have an enormous role to play, because they can sometimes get people's problems resolved faster, and then we have to watch, because there is a price that could be paid in terms of fairness that you nor I nor anyone wants to see paid. So I end up usually thinking, yes, it is a good idea to look at all those things. They can produce wonderful results inexpensively. But watch, be careful that that system doesn't turn into an unfair system.Those are the two general things in my mind that I think about with that.

The thrust of the review, it was a restrained style. As I said, maybe my style is dry. I hope my thinking isn't dry. My thinking was that, no, economics doesn't. So a person had gotten into a bad fix and it was his or her own fault, to which the response is so what, so what? If somebody comes to your doorstep and they are in trouble, you help them. You help them, even if maybe it is their fault. So what? In that kind of decision, I am not saying if you want to evaluate a program or you want to know how well something is working or you want to compare some alternatives, maybe economics has some role there. But to the basic question of how do you help, that is not an economic question. That is a moral question, and it is that kind of thing that I think people should appeal to in that area, and that is the kind of thing that they do appeal to, and you have to decide those things as matters of legislative policy. 

It depends. I think no process works perfectly, but I would like to think that in writing reports, there used to be— and I think there is—it is a method. The different staffs of the Senators who are involved in that are supposed to, and when it is working well, they understand their Senators' positions on matters of policy, and they keep everyone informed.It used to be before any report came out, there were no secrets; everything is circulated to everybody, and they are supposed to read it and understand whether that correctly reflects the view, the policy view, of the Senator who did the voting.And I do not know if it always works perfectly, but it is supposed to be circulated, open, understood, and reflect the policy.Looking to reports—yes, sometimes. Sometimes floor statements can help, and sometimes, for reasons that you say, they do not. I find it more of an art, and it is hard.

My thinking is that people have a terrible problem with crime—it could hardly be worse; very, very bad—and they would like help with it. And in respect to jurisdiction, that is one aspect of the problem. That is not a determinative aspect.So my suggestion, if you are asking for a suggestion, is that when Congress or a legislature of any State is working on criminal373 "•jurisdiction, on criminalizing behavior, that they think out what is going to happen in practice when this law is enforced—who will enforce it; how; which courts will be affected—and then, with that in mind, make a judgment about how to create a system, including the way it gets into court, that will most effectively stop crime.In other words, I am asking, I think, to think, whether it is the Justice Department, or here, or in other places, that they think through ways of allocating crime-fighting resources as well as courts, so that overall, you are more effective in the aim of fighting crime.

I do not have special thoughts that I would think would be particularly enlightening in that area.

The input is important; the input is good. The Conference itself works mostly through committees. The biggest change that has been going on is the change resulting from the law that you described earlier, Senator Biden's Civil Reform Act, and that requires committees that are made up of lawyers and all kinds of people who are not judges to have input into that process.My impression has been that that input has been important and has worked pretty well.

Thank you. I thank them, too. 

I think the general word, better than "proximate"—I do not know if that was exactly it—what I am thinking of with that is if the interest is—if there is only a speculative effect on your investment, or a remote effect, or contingent, then, under the present standard, you do not disqualify yourself. If it is a substantial effect, you do—direct, substantial—all right, those are the words.And of course, as you point out, in that case, I did not think that there could be more than an indirect or speculative or remote effect on the insurance industry at all, let alone Lloyd's or my own pocketbook.Do you want to change that standard—that is really your question. And I will sympathize with both things that you said. It is absolutely crucial that the integrity of the system be clear, that people have confidence in it, that they absolutely know that a pocketbook is not guiding a case. That could not be more important to me, not only personally—and it is personal—but to the system as a whole.Now, if you are going to try to worry about—and it is worth worrying about—but you will find judges do have investments. It is perfectly clear that if any investment is directly involved in that case, a party, you are out, even if it is worth one penny; but where there is not that direct participation, the reason that the standard have evolved as they have, I think, is because it is so possible there will be remote or indirect connections in so many cases. Could a judge sit in an FDIC case if he owns real estate somewhere, knowing that possibly the holding could in some remote way affect the value of some real estate?What is the possible remote connection—do you see why I think I agree with you that it is very difficult?

I am not saying that it is not worth thinking about. I think it probably

That is true. That is correct. 

That is correct. 

On the one hand, I know I had a case in which I wrote that the school system, when they have a place open for public meetings, has to let churches meet there, too, religious groups, too. Certainly, there is support for religion in the Constitution.When you come to the establishment clause, it is well established that that clause does not prohibit tax exemption. To the contrary, there is tax exemption.

And when you get into areas beyond that, when you get into areas of definition when the support is greater, what I have said before—and it is hard to go beyond this—is there are difficult problems of line-drawing. The principle is fairly clear in the establishment area at the extremes. Some is absolutely permitted—the fire department, the tax exemptions of certain kinds, busing of certain kinds. Some is quite clearly prohibited. And then what you find are a difficult set of cases in this middle area, and what is going too far.It is hard for me to be more specific than that, because those are the cases that do come up, that are difficult, that I would have to think about in light of the particular context. That is in the legal area. Outside the legal area, I am not expert.

Yes. 

Yes, I think that is a fair question. And as I saw what you described as the wall, what I saw as underlying that, which I think is more important today than ever, is that we are a nation—in terms of values—we are a nation of many, many different people, many different groups, many different religions, and each person's religion—mine and yours, and that of every other person—is extremely important to him, to her, to his family. And the history of the first amendment teaches us that that importance, legally, grows out of a world in which those religious differences on matters of such importance led to wars, death—and you still see that in some places. And for that reason, the thing that must be preserved is the freedom to practice, the freedom to pass that along to your children. That is why schools are so important, and 

NO, no. 

That is such a politically divisive and such a political matter, and so important to so many people in so many different directions, that I think I have to restrict myself in that very divisive, potentially, very uncertain area. I have to draw back to the law. And when I go back to the law and try to go further in how I would approach the thing from a legal point of view, remember the thing that I have tried to identify as underlying this is each person thinks, "My religion is terribly important," and each person is right. Each person thinks, "I want to pass this on to my children," and each person is right. But each person may think, or many may think, "It is fine if the Government favors me and my religion," but then, I would ask that person to think: But suppose it is not your religion that the Government is favoring? And that question, which asks for neutrality on the part of the people who practice religion—me and you and everybody else—that is the kind of question that the establishment clause is asking people to ask themselves.

Oh, I see. You are thinking of the Government program

Yes, we do. Yes, we do. 

And can I go beyond the general thing that I have tried to say about asking ourselves: "It is fine if it is my religion. How do I feel if it is somebody else's religion?" and is this going to be impermissible favoritism, going too far, or is it the kind of thing that we find all the time 

The trouble is I keep coming back to thinking that is one of those difficult line-drawing questions that could be right in front of us if I am on the Court. That is my problem. 

Yes. 

Well, I do not know if that is too helpful, but yes. Ask any of the people who were involved or their families, "Was that a war?" and they will say it certainly was. 

It does—I looked up, I tried to find—after our conversation, which was very interesting, I tried to see if there had been any precedent where this kind of question was resolved in the Supreme Court, and I think there has not been, though I think that some of the Justices dissented and said that the Court should get involved in that during the Vietnam period.I would say it does not surprise me, that absence of precedent, because there is nothing more important than questions of war and peace, and fighting and not fighting, and defending and not defending. And the kind of question you are talking about is of such extraordinary importance to the public, and it is not surprising to me that the courts, which are an unelected—unelected—third branch of government, have said that these matters of such great importance in a political context should be worked out between the first and second branches of government, both of which involve elections and are responsible directly to the people. That does not surprise me, that.

Yes. 

Yes, yes. 

I know, despite—I mean, I can understand what has happened in light of what I just said, and it does seem to reflect something about the nature of these terribly important decisions in a democracy. I thought—in addition, I know cases—we were talking to Senator Pressler about the old, old case of the Indian tribes and so forth, and sometimes, people can work out ways of getting these into courts in certain contexts. 

NO. 

Yes, yes, I think so. 

Correct, that is correct. 

I think the framework in that—basically, it is an affirmative answer—the framework, the way that I see it legally working out, there are two different circumstances. One, you start381 with article III, where it says the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court and other courts that you in Congress create. And then it says the judicial power shall extend to all cases of certain kinds, which it then enunciates.So that to me suggests—and this would be one kind of issue— but if you take cases out of the courts and put them in a different court, there will still be cases that you will not have the power to take out of the Supreme Court because of the way that is written.The other kind of issue that comes up is where the courts are deciding a case, but what Congress in principle might do is say let us not make this a case. It used to be called a tort case. Now we are going to give it to an administrative agency, and we will say it is not a case anymore; it is an agency matter.Now, could Congress do that to any old thing and thereby remove all those things from the Court? Justice Brandeis said the question there is under what circumstances the process that is required by the Constitution before you can invade life, liberty, or property is due process; when is that due process judicial process? And obviously, he is thinking there would be a core of important cases where the process that the Constitution requires before one takes away liberty, and property in certain circumstances, that that is judicial process, and that is the area that the Constitution would protect.

I do not think there is a categorical answer in terms of constitutional versus nonconstitutional. The place to begin in my mind is there is a famous opinion called Crowell v. Benson. And really, in that opinion, Justice Brandeis wrote a concurrence, I think, in which he tried to explain this view that sometimes the process that is due is judicial process. And then, when is that process judicial process; when does the right require judicial process? And it is going to be something involving core liberty and terribly important rights of fairness and so forth. And exactly which ones and how would depend—if Congress ever passed such a statute, and then it came up to the Court, you would get into looking at the shadings and exactly how they did it. But that core principle I think is well explained by Justice Brandeis in that case.

Oh, you see, it is going to be the question—you know there are issues and issues. The core principle there, the core freedom of speech, it is pretty hard for me to see how that would be possible, because if you want the kind of layman's reaction, which is all I can do at this moment, it is to think my goodness, what an important right, and isn't it judicial process—but indeed, that kind of right, it maybe cannot be taken away with any process.

Yes, I think—what is the—I cannot remember at the moment whether the question was phrased affirmatively or negatively. [Laughter.] 

Again, it is the same core idea there. The core idea, fundamental—some of those rights, they cannot take the right away at all. And so, since you cannot take it away at all, you cannot take it away with any process. And then, if you could limit it at all, it is the kind of important thing that on its face would seem to call for judicial process. The details would depend on a particular statute and what was really at stake. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Yes, yes. 

Yes, that is agreeable, Senator. Thank you. 

My understanding in the area of commercial speech is that there is protection, but that it is different. And my understanding is that it is not meant to impede legitimate regulation. Quite clearly, the Federal Trade Commission can prevent people in the commercial area from making statements that are false. Quite clearly, various agencies can impose labeling requirements, even down to exactly what words should be said, though that is, of course, a form of regulating speech.I suspect that the case that you are discussing was a case that arose on particular facts and particular circumstances looking to see how necessary that particular regulation was in the particular case compared with the right of the corporation. I am sure if that kind of issue arose again, it would be important for me, if I were on the Court, and any other judge to examine the facts and circumstances in light of the knowledge that commercial speech is different. There is protection, but there is also regulatory need which feeds into the balance.

I will. 

Yes. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you. 

Yes, that is right, Senator. 

Yes. 

I think it is. That is what I was trying to do in various ways, to make as clear as I can some of the problems of maybe spending too much here and not enough there. And if people think about that and then the public and people who read it or anyone else in the world who is interested in this area decides that is what we would like to do, that is the end of the matter. All it does is it calls this to people's attention. They are to think about it. And if we can think of a way that people would prefer, other people, not me—I am the one calling it to their attention. If they then think that is how they would like to proceed, fine. That is up to other people, groups who know more about it than I do, calling it to the attention of Congress, who then may decide to do something different or may not. 

NO, I did not. I said look at the problem. Look at the problem, here are some suggestions as to how one might talk to Congress. If you think it is a problem, I do not guarantee this is the solution. I do not guarantee there is a solution. But I do see this as a problem that is worth talking about.

I think what happens under that is, of course, there has to be a privacy interest of the person who is complaining in any of the three. And then I think under this idea of unreasonableness or reasonableness, the Supreme Court has cases that, in general terms, describe circumstances in which something is or is not reasonable. And my thought would be that those general descriptions do not vary, but what might vary are the circumstances that bring something within or without.That is how I think it probably works. 

That could be part of the circumstance. I would not say never. 

I do not think so. 

I would say, Senator, that I have been preparing pretty hard for these hearings over the last few weeks. I have not read the papers every day. I have not noticed every case that the Supreme Court has decided to decide next term. But I did notice one. 

AS you can see, on this one, when other people laughed, I have laughed. I have made no indication with my head one way or the other. I do not think that I have particularly smiled out of place. And I think that that is where I would like to leave it, if that is all right. 

I do not have a better view. I do not have a better view.

Thank you very much, Senator. I appreciate it. Thank you.

At that time I thought 

Meaning roughly in, I guess, 1990 approximately, 1991, roughly in there. From all I knew my maximum liability if I stayed was around, I guess, something like 25,000 pounds, andI had a lot of insurance with companies outside Lloyd's that would protect me from a further loss.When I made the inquiry, I was told it is not practical, and then when I—I mean, my impression was it was not practical to get out immediately. And I was enforced or reinforced in that view by the response, which was: If you want to leave immediately, you will have to pay a figure which is almost 10 times, 8 to 10 times that amount. My impression was if I waited for maybe a year or two— and now it is into 1995—Lloyd's would arrange through the reinsurance company that I would be released and the amount would relate roughly to what I am likely to be liable for. So I took that, as a practical matter, as a negative indication.

At the beginning, at the very beginning, I think January or February 1993,1 read in the paper that a man who was being considered for a Justice Department post owed Social Security taxes on a part-time home worker who was over the age of 65—indeed, who was in her seventies. At that point, I suddenly thought, well, we have a person who is close to 80, and she is parttime, and why don't we owe taxes on her?My wife and I and the person discussed this, and we all had thought, incorrectly—incorrectly—that if a person is receiving Social Security, as she always had been, you do not have to pay Social Security. At that point, since we realized there was a problem, Joanna went to the IRS. We straightened out the problem. We initially paid immediate

Yes; yes, an American citizen with a passport. American passport. 

Yes. 

Yes; and what we did was then go to the Internal Revenue Service, Joanna did. We immediately paid the tax for 1992. We had to send away for lots of forms, because it goes quarter by quarter, to get all the taxes and forms and everything back until she really first came on that basis. I think it was some time just after 1980, approximately. And we then got all the forms. It took a period of weeks, and we sent the money in for each quarter.393 Then, after June of last year, during the summer, there were a number of open questions. It was difficult or uncertain what we— Joanne went back to the IRS. They were very helpful, worked through this, decided that it was a borderline case, gave us forms to fill out, gave us forms for her to fill out; and on the basis of long questionnaires and so forth, ultimately determined that we did not owe taxes because she was not an employee. 

Yes, that is right. That is right. 

NO; you fill out a form. They have a system that they will work it out for you, for anyone. Anyone who wants to come in and fill out that form and go through this process, they will make a determination for you. 

YOU do not owe it. 

That is right. 

That is right. And they determined that she was an independent contractor, and we did not owe the Social Security up through the end of 1988. But, thereafter, 1989, 1990, 1991, we did owe it and the result of that—and we had paid in 1992 and we paid in 1993. 

My belief is that there are a bunch of factors on which they make that determination, and the thing that had changed, though I was not aware of this, is that at that time, though she came in the same way she always had to us, she had stopped working for other people. I think she was, you know, in her late seventies. That, I think, was then the determinative factor. 

Yes; that is the situation as far as I knew it, and that is my understanding of what happened. 

Initially the IRS assesses a penalty automatically. What happened thereafter, since they determined it was a borderline case and they understood that we were in good faith, is the IRS refunded to us all the payments we had made up until— through the end of 1988, and also all amounts that they had automatically assessed a penalty. So they canceled that and we received the money back.394 

That is correct. 

That is my understanding. 

Thank you, Senator. 

Thank you, Senator. 

I agree. 

Thank you. [Whereupon, at 6:54 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to reconvene at 10 a.m. on Friday, July 15, 1994.]NOMINATION OF STEPHEN G.
